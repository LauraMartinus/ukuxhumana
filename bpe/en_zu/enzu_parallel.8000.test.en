S@@ ti@@ mul@@ ating economic growth through coordin@@ ated infrastructure investment and strategic programmes 
A Requ@@ est for Qu@@ alif@@ ication was issued last week to the Mar@@ ket for a D@@ esig@@ n , Con@@ struc@@ t , F@@ ix@@ ed Pr@@ ice T@@ ur@@ n@@ key contract . The purpose of this proc@@ ur@@ ement is to enable the D@@ T@@ P 
In respect of S@@ M@@ M@@ E support , during the trade mission to Indi@@ a in Dec@@ ember 200@@ 5 led by the Premier , contact was established with the National S@@ m@@ all Indus@@ tries Cor@@ poration L@@ t@@ d in Indi@@ a , 
The improv@@ ement in employment figures over the last year , mor@@ e@@ over , is cer@@ tain@@ ly parti@@ ally attr@@ ib@@ ut@@ able to the co@@ oper@@ atives initi@@ ative , which is already esti@@ m@@ ated to have attr@@ acted close to 3@@ 5 000 individuals , 
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing success in the promotion of co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s means that our resources must be direc@@ ted to support both co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s at district level . 
int@@ er alia , a coordin@@ ated and effici@@ ently implemented infrastruc@@ tural investment programme , in which both government and the private sector will have major rol@@ es to play . 
In this regard I am also pl@@ eased to report very satis@@ fac@@ tory progress over the last year@@ : 
In the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ T@@ E@@ F , r@@ ing@@ -@@ f@@ enced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job cre@@ ation , poverty rel@@ ief and black economic empow@@ erment . These programmes are the follow@@ ing: 
 this strategy in tur@@ n is al@@ ig@@ ned to the national Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated and Sh@@ ar@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative . The r@@ ation@@ ale behind this approach is sim@@ pl@@ e: 
Em@@ pow@@ erment initiatives 
A further 5 high prof@@ ile cases of fr@@ au@@ d and cor@@ ruption involv@@ ing sy@@ nd@@ ic@@ ates are under investigation , and we have jo@@ ined forces with the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations and As@@ set For@@ fe@@ it@@ ure Unit in order to secure successful pro@@ secu@@ tions . 
Mr Speaker , in last years address I all@@ ud@@ ed to the fact that we will not att@@ ain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty all@@ ev@@ iation programmes 
 the Office of the Premier will be responsible for coordin@@ ating the s@@ occ@@ er development programme across the departments involved . 
into the second ph@@ ase of development by establ@@ ishing sec@@ ond@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary co@@ oper@@ atives . El@@ even sec@@ ond@@ ary co@@ ops will be set@@ up in each of the district municipalities and me@@ tr@@ o , 
pre-@@ qualif@@ ied b@@ id@@ ders that are techn@@ ically , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally and leg@@ ally qualif@@ ied and meet the empow@@ erment cr@@ it@@ eria , 
S@@ uch practices have to become far more efficient , ens@@ uring that administrative del@@ ays do not place un@@ be@@ ar@@ able c@@ ash@@ f@@ low bur@@ den on the S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s . 
In terms of employment , according to the St@@ ats SA Labour For@@ ce Sur@@ v@@ ey , in 200@@ 4 9@@ 9@@ 3 ,@@ 000 people in the province were un@@ employed - this dec@@ lin@@ ed to 9@@ 8@@ 7 ,@@ 000 in 200@@ 5 , 
The re@@ forms in our as@@ set and supply ch@@ ain management systems and policies are proce@@ eding on tr@@ ack and are set to gre@@ at@@ ly improve effici@@ encies in the way we proc@@ ure and account for goods and services and physical assets . 
The land at L@@ a M@@ erc@@ y to be sold to the province . 
World Cup stadium development 
The int@@ ention is to provide a br@@ id@@ g@@ ing programme , a one year certificate , a two year di@@ pl@@ oma and a three year d@@ eg@@ ree in co@@ oper@@ atives and business management practice . 
Some of the cases are before the courts of law and mis@@ conduct enquir@@ ies are also being handl@@ ed by respective departments . 
Both I@@ th@@ ala and the Provincial Government conc@@ ede that this dem@@ and for fin@@ ance cannot be m@@ et by I@@ th@@ ala al@@ one . 
for emerg@@ ing contr@@ actors aimed at promoting and supporting af@@ firm@@ able business and equ@@ ity in the civil and building contr@@ ac@@ tor sector . It com@@ pr@@ ises a si@@ x@@ -@@ st@@ aged adv@@ anc@@ ement programme with contract value lim@@ its determined by experience , training and capacity . 
G@@ iven the h@@ ug@@ e deal f@@ low which the initi@@ al S@@ M@@ M@@ E fund managed by I@@ th@@ ala has already gener@@ ated , the He@@ ad of T@@ reas@@ ury was t@@ asked to develop a sch@@ eme 
which will then ent@@ er into contr@@ ac@@ tual agreements with A@@ C@@ SA to manage and operate the air@@ port and with the sel@@ ected b@@ id@@ der from the private sector to design and construc@@ t the facility . 
amoun@@ ting to appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately R@@ 6@@ b@@ n in 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 , to sti@@ mul@@ ate growth in the S@@ M@@ M@@ E sector and to adv@@ ance black economic empow@@ erment gener@@ ally .

The focus will be on dis@@ sem@@ ination of information and g@@ iving guid@@ ance to women , youth and the dis@@ abled . 
The rel@@ oc@@ ation of Durban International A@@ ir@@ port when K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International is oper@@ ational in 200@@ 9 ; and 
D@@ r@@ aft legislation establ@@ ishing the D@@ T@@ P has been prepar@@ ed and will be submitted to this Leg@@ isl@@ ature in Mar@@ ch . I appeal to H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members to ensure that this Bill is deal@@ t with within the str@@ ict ti@@ me@@ fr@@ ames we have set our@@ selves . 
As I mentioned , this year we will also be institu@@ ting a new co-@@ fin@@ anc@@ ing mod@@ el to support the growth of the small business sector in the province . 
An important part of governments infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic investment programme for the medi@@ um term is the R@@ ich@@ ards Bay Indus@@ trial Development Z@@ one . 
if economic growth can be st@@ ep@@ ped up to av@@ er@@ age 4 ,@@ 5 over the next five years , and 6 from 200@@ 9 to 20@@ 14 , th@@ en@@ : 
to empow@@ er them so as to be cap@@ able of run@@ ning vi@@ able commercial enterprises . This means that sec@@ ond@@ ary co@@ ops will need to pos@@ s@@ ess skills in financial management , 
We are pro@@ pos@@ ing to al@@ loc@@ ate R@@ 3@@ 1@@ m , R@@ 8@@ 9@@ m and R@@ 1@@ 3@@ 9 ,@@ 5@@ m over the M@@ T@@ E@@ F period as a contribution to the building of s@@ occ@@ er stadium infrastructure in the province . 
A special training unit has been created in collabor@@ ation with the Un@@ iversity of Z@@ ul@@ ul@@ and to tr@@ ain manag@@ ers and members of co@@ ops and to develop c@@ are@@ ers in the field . 
with the main functions of providing support to primary co@@ oper@@ atives , which are by design production units . The int@@ ention is to ensure that primary co@@ oper@@ atives get support from sec@@ ond@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary co@@ oper@@ atives , 
This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Tr@@ ad@@ itional Affairs , 
which will together with the Department of S@@ port and Rec@@ re@@ ation play a coordin@@ ating role in ass@@ isting the District Municip@@ alities of Am@@ aj@@ uba , U@@ g@@ u , uM@@ g@@ ung@@ un@@ dl@@ ov@@ u and u@@ Th@@ ung@@ ulu 
In the area of govern@@ ance and risk management , quar@@ ter@@ ly summ@@ ary reports on the risk prof@@ ile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet . 
A contract is being con@@ clud@@ ed with the N@@ S@@ I@@ C team of consult@@ ants , who will be based in the province for 10 weeks , and who will work with a team from T@@ reas@@ ury and E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development . 
mar@@ k@@ eting and general business management . For technical skills sec@@ ond@@ ary co@@ ops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required exper@@ tise and for private sector w@@ ishing to do business with this sector . 
The D@@ ube Tr@@ ad@@ eP@@ ort Section 21 Comp@@ any will have to be conver@@ ted into a stat@@ ut@@ ory public entity under the P@@ F@@ M@@ A that is empow@@ ered to establish K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International A@@ ir@@ port Special P@@ ur@@ pose V@@ ehic@@ le , 
Ag@@ ainst this back@@ ground , what are the governments expenditure prior@@ ities for the new M@@ T@@ E@@ F budget cy@@ c@@ le comm@@ enc@@ ing in six week@@ s@@ ? 
including the provision and lo@@ an of capital equipment , on a day to day basis and are not dep@@ end@@ ant on government support perman@@ ently . Sup@@ port will be given to sec@@ ond@@ ary co@@ ops 
E@@ C@@ O@@ N@@ O@@ M@@ I@@ C S@@ NA@@ PS@@ H@@ O@@ T 
int@@ er alia through the b@@ arg@@ aining mus@@ c@@ le it will ac@@ quir@@ e over the control of resources and mar@@ kets through the she@@ er scale of its operations , with benefits f@@ low@@ ing to members of the co@@ oper@@ atives . 
The fl@@ ag@@ ship D@@ ube Tr@@ ad@@ eP@@ ort project incor@@ por@@ ating a state of the ar@@ t A@@ ir@@ port in K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International has made sol@@ id progress and we are on tr@@ ack to achieve our de@@ adl@@ ine for the project to be oper@@ ational by 200@@ 9 . 
Our qu@@ est to n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w the g@@ ap between the first and second economies will continue to be a centr@@ al fe@@ ature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as b@@ ar@@ bed w@@ ire , cer@@ am@@ ic til@@ es , agr@@ i-@@ food products , building materials , paper products etc ; 
will deal with each of these three policy pri@@ ority areas in tur@@ n . 
allow@@ ing time in the first year of the M@@ T@@ E@@ F for the stak@@ eholders to fin@@ alise the business case , funding mod@@ el and own@@ ership arrangements . 
I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term consist@@ ency in the budget policy framework and direc@@ tion to achieve maximum impact over time . 
The equipment and professional exper@@ tise provided by the N@@ S@@ I@@ C will be used to support the growth and development of small medi@@ um and mic@@ r@@ o enterprises in the province , including co@@ oper@@ atives at both the primary and sec@@ ond@@ ary level . 
C@@ o-@@ fin@@ anc@@ ing strategy 
The int@@ ention 
and an electron@@ ic system to perform the ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion stage of S@@ C@@ M , nam@@ ely the sour@@ c@@ ing of Qu@@ ot@@ ations and T@@ end@@ ers this project will both improve effici@@ encies and tur@@ n@@ around times as well as help to elimin@@ ate fr@@ au@@ d and cor@@ ruption . 
Our pro@@ posal is to set as@@ ide R@@ 20 mil@@ lion , R@@ 2@@ 00 mil@@ lion and R@@ 1 ,@@ 5 billion over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F years for this project this is over and above the R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m already in this years budget for the Trade P@@ ort . 
I have all@@ ud@@ ed to the succ@@ esses already att@@ ained in establ@@ ishing primary co@@ oper@@ atives around the province in the last year . This year we int@@ end to m@@ ove the co@@ oper@@ atives programme 
But hope sm@@ il@@ es from the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come Wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing it will be happ@@ ier ; 
for fin@@ anc@@ ing business applications from primary co@@ oper@@ atives will be a@@ ug@@ ment@@ ed by al@@ loc@@ ations of R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m , R@@ 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ m and R@@ 2@@ 1@@ 7@@ m over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F these funds will be managed by the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development . 
In re@@ view@@ ing its policy prior@@ ities for the new M@@ T@@ E@@ F period , the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the go@@ al of plac@@ ing the province on a sus@@ tain@@ ably high@@ er growth pat@@ h a centr@@ al part of its economic development strategy 
In the Mar@@ ch budget address a year ago it was emphas@@ ized that government intended to use its proc@@ ur@@ ement sp@@ end on goods and services , 
As the D@@ T@@ P will no longer be established as a P@@ P@@ P , the R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m allocated to the project in this years budget will be ro@@ u@@ ted via I@@ th@@ ala to facilitate site prepar@@ ation work including site ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion , per@@ im@@ eter f@@ enc@@ ing , 
This does not me@@ an that we will be neg@@ l@@ ecting the need for continued support for primary co@@ oper@@ atives . The initi@@ al al@@ location of R@@ 1@@ 10@@ m to I@@ th@@ ala in the current financial year 
This investment will sti@@ mul@@ ate economic development along these nod@@ es and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
A@@ C@@ SA to ac@@ quir@@ e a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a conc@@ es@@ sion within or after the 10 year term ; 
This is a significant development , as h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th govern@@ ance and risk management issues c@@ ut@@ ting across all departments will be highl@@ ighted at an executive level . 
This pres@@ sure on I@@ th@@ ala is a refl@@ ection that in S@@ M@@ M@@ E fin@@ ance for the dis@@ advant@@ aged , I@@ th@@ ala is the institution of cho@@ ice . 
In terms of over@@ all economic growth , according to St@@ ats SA KwaZulu-Natal record@@ ed a growth rate of 4 ,@@ 9 in 200@@ 4 , second only to the Western Cape at 5 ,@@ 3 and above the national growth rate of 4 ,@@ 5 
Est@@ abl@@ ishment of sec@@ ond@@ ary co@@ oper@@ atives 
which we hope to con@@ clud@@ e by Dec@@ ember 200@@ 6 . A@@ ward of the contract will follow and it is expected that main construction will comm@@ ence in Mar@@ ch 200@@ 7 , with facilities to be completed and oper@@ ational by Oc@@ t@@ ob@@ er 200@@ 9 . 
But some of you might leg@@ iti@@ mat@@ ely ask whether all these government interventions have had a meas@@ ur@@ able effect on improv@@ ing the economic performance of the province . 
The D@@ ube Tr@@ ad@@ eP@@ ort as a stat@@ ut@@ ory public entity will be m@@ and@@ ated to drive the trade z@@ one development , the cy@@ ber@@ port , the agricultural z@@ one and other associated commercial develop@@ ments . 
Be@@ fore the end of J@@ une the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development will conv@@ ene a conference involv@@ ing representatives of all municipalities to discus@@ s common and coordin@@ ated approach to Local E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development . 
We must re@@ alise that we are do@@ om@@ ing the co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s we are establ@@ ishing to fail@@ ure from the out@@ set unless we follow through by facilit@@ ating access to government proc@@ ur@@ ement on a sustainable basis . 
The Un@@ iversity of KwaZulu-Natal will also be appro@@ ached on a similar basis . 
J@@ ust to what extent these im@@ pres@@ sive growth and employment figures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficul@@ t to qu@@ an@@ tify at this stage . 
 we are of the un@@ sh@@ ak@@ e@@ able view that 
To this end , we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year . 
Many people in the izimb@@ izo reported del@@ ays in get@@ ting approval this is sim@@ ply due to the large v@@ olum@@ es of applications . 
Although we have ind@@ eed made progress in addres@@ sing the centr@@ al challenges of poverty , un@@ employment and service back@@ log@@ s in the past year , much remains to be done in the short , medi@@ um and long term . 
Cr@@ imin@@ al investig@@ ations , which will ev@@ ent@@ ually lead to pro@@ secu@@ tion , are being conducted by the Special Investig@@ ation Unit , a div@@ ision of the National Pro@@ secu@@ ting Authority . 
It will apply to both civil engine@@ ering works such as air@@ ports , run@@ ways , br@@ id@@ ges , roads etc , as well as general building works . 
which has more than f@@ if@@ ty years experience in promoting the growth of small scale indus@@ tries and business enterprises . We are explor@@ ing two areas of cooperation with the N@@ S@@ IC@@ : 
The S@@ E@@ D@@ As will work in collabor@@ ation with I@@ th@@ ala and the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development to provide support services at district level 
and fin@@ ance , re@@ al estate and business services , which gre@@ w at 7 ,@@ 9 . The manufac@@ turing sector gre@@ w at a heal@@ thy rate of 4 ,@@ 5 . 
 and fail@@ ure to meet the de@@ adl@@ ine is not an option then all rol@@ e-@@ players will have to play their part , including this Leg@@ isl@@ ature . 
but that B@@ E@@ E@@ -@@ owned companies and emerg@@ ing contr@@ actors en@@ jo@@ y maximum benefit from the contr@@ acts put out to t@@ ender . T@@ reas@@ ury has accord@@ ingly developed a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed infrastructure proc@@ ur@@ ement policy 
We remain determined therefore to ful@@ fi@@ l our oblig@@ ations to the taxpay@@ ing citizens of this country by maint@@ aining and ind@@ eed improv@@ ing our high standards in the field of financial management and good govern@@ ance . 
T@@ reas@@ ury took an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented m@@ ove to eng@@ age law@@ y@@ ers to op@@ pose court applications against the Department of Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are , and that s@@ av@@ ed mil@@ li@@ ons of r@@ ands while it unc@@ overed a sc@@ am which was dr@@ aining funds dest@@ ined for the poor . 
Mr Speaker , H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members , I must str@@ ess that if the de@@ adl@@ ine for the project to be oper@@ ational by 200@@ 9 is to be m@@ et 
and other ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ities , amoun@@ ting to the loss of t@@ ens of mil@@ li@@ ons of r@@ ands in various departments , public enti@@ ties and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year . 
in such a way that governments B@@ E@@ E policy and objectives are m@@ et . I expec@@ t in the coming year to be able to report ac@@ tual expenditure figures per department on proc@@ ur@@ ement from B@@ E@@ E companies , S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s and co@@ oper@@ atives . 
unless at the same time we focus as a government on improv@@ ing effici@@ encies and achiev@@ ing better value for the v@@ ast sum@@ s of money we sp@@ end on these programmes . 
M@@ ay I rem@@ ind you again of the words of Al@@ fr@@ ed l@@ ord T@@ en@@ ny@@ son who s@@ a@@ id@@ : 
We pro@@ pose to set as@@ ide R@@ 90 mil@@ lion and R@@ 1@@ 00 mil@@ lion in 200@@ 7@@ /@@ 0@@ 8 and 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 respec@@ tively for development of the ID@@ Z , 
In the M@@ T@@ E@@ F period , therefore , funding al@@ loc@@ ations of R@@ 50 , R@@ 5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 6@@ 0@@ m have been set as@@ ide for the development of s@@ occ@@ er at all levels in the province in collabor@@ ation with SA@@ F@@ A 
with a tol@@ l free number to assist with qu@@ er@@ ies . This will be set up by A@@ pr@@ il this year . 
Pro@@ g@@ ress was also made in enforc@@ ing our policy of z@@ er@@ o tol@@ er@@ ance for fr@@ au@@ d and cor@@ ruption . Si@@ x high prof@@ ile investig@@ ations into fr@@ au@@ d , cor@@ ruption , theft , mis@@ management , mal@@ administration 
I can say with some conf@@ idence that the programmes and economic sectors being prior@@ it@@ ised by government , with one or two excep@@ tions , appear to be yi@@ el@@ ding positive results in terms of performance and trends over the last two years . 
In respect of Per@@ form@@ ance B@@ ud@@ g@@ eting System , the rol@@ l@@ out of the system in departments is proce@@ eding on sch@@ edule , and demonstr@@ ation data bas@@ es have been install@@ ed in Provincial T@@ reas@@ ury , Health and Trans@@ port . 
that will bring ban@@ ks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s in the Provin@@ ce , ther@@ eb@@ y rel@@ iev@@ ing the pres@@ sure on I@@ th@@ ala . 
The bal@@ ance of funds required will have to come from deb@@ t fin@@ anc@@ ing . The Development Bank has already agreed in princi@@ ple to provide deb@@ t funding sec@@ ured against revenue stre@@ ams of the project up to R@@ 5@@ 00@@ m . 
income per cap@@ it@@ a will r@@ ise by 50 in the next ten years , and the rate of un@@ employment will be hal@@ v@@ ed . 
In this regard , government has identified several key projects and programmes as prior@@ ities for the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ T@@ E@@ F . These can be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follow@@ s: 
It is un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic however , to expec@@ t that the provincial economy will laun@@ ch itself onto a high@@ er growth pat@@ h on its own acc@@ ord . A struc@@ tural growth acc@@ el@@ eration of this mag@@ nit@@ ude will require , 
We have sec@@ ured a leg@@ ally b@@ inding Mo@@ U with A@@ C@@ SA and the National Minister of Trans@@ port providing for@@ : 
S@@ ite prepar@@ ation and install@@ ation of back@@ b@@ one infrastructure is expected to comm@@ ence by the end of the cal@@ end@@ ar year . 
The challenge fac@@ ing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within plan@@ ned ti@@ me@@ fr@@ ames , 
and the commis@@ sion@@ ing of a stud@@ y by a team of N@@ S@@ I@@ C exper@@ ts to review the current mechanisms , legislation and policies in the province designed to support S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s in the province . 
It is often heard that leng@@ thy del@@ ays occ@@ ur in pay@@ ing the S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s 
When President Mb@@ eki s@@ a@@ id@@ : C@@ lear@@ ly the m@@ asses of our people are conv@@ inc@@ ed that our country has entered into its age of H@@ op@@ e , I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say S@@ I@@ Y@@ A@@ V@@ UM@@ A . 
based on an av@@ er@@ age of 9 people per co@@ oper@@ ative many of these have already found employment through their co@@ oper@@ atives or are lik@@ ely to do so in the near future . 
to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camp@@ s . We are also of the view however that we need not just to build s@@ occ@@ er stadium infrastructure , but also the s@@ port itself in the province . 
D@@ isc@@ us@@ sions are also in progress on the fin@@ anc@@ ing mod@@ el for the Trade P@@ ort . The total investment required for the air@@ port , which is part of the Trade P@@ ort , is about R@@ 2 .@@ 5 billion over the next four to five years . 
7@@ 0 at Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are ; 2@@ 3 at Home Affairs ; 3 ,@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 in other departments ; and 15 medical doc@@ tors and ag@@ ents were im@@ plic@@ ated . 
back@@ b@@ one infrastructure out@@ l@@ ay and the development of the N@@ 2 inter@@ change . The t@@ end@@ ers for this initi@@ al site prepar@@ ation and technical work have already clos@@ ed and are currently being ad@@ jud@@ icated . 
once again well above the national av@@ er@@ age , and close to the A@@ S@@ G@@ I-@@ SA targ@@ et of 6 . 
The provincial budget will accord@@ ingly continue to play a key role as policy instrum@@ ent to address the soci@@ o@@ economic challenges con@@ fron@@ ting us . 
This is con@@ cre@@ te proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empow@@ erment . 
Fund@@ ing in the amount of R@@ 5@@ 0@@ m , R@@ 5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 60 ,@@ 5@@ m has been allocated to the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development for the establishment of sec@@ ond@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary co@@ oper@@ atives in the M@@ T@@ E@@ F period . 
We have undertaken to co@@ operate with and assist the South African W@@ om@@ en En@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s in collabor@@ ation with the Department of Trade and Industry . 
This ID@@ Z was pro@@ cl@@ aimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 200@@ 2 . Sin@@ ce then , however , there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure out@@ l@@ ays required to make the ID@@ Z work . 
to sel@@ ect at least 2 , but no more than 3 
sti@@ mul@@ ating economic growth through coordin@@ ated infrastructure investment , cre@@ ating j@@ obs and all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy , and exp@@ an@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improv@@ ing service delivery . 
and that have sufficient experience and resources 
IN@@ T@@ E@@ R@@ V@@ EN@@ T@@ IO@@ N T@@ H@@ R@@ E@@ E@@ : V@@ al@@ ue for money and good govern@@ ance initiatives 
It is sur@@ ely no co@@ inc@@ idence , however , that growth in the construction sector is sur@@ g@@ ing , given the provincial governments increas@@ ed expenditure on infrastructure tot@@ all@@ ing R@@ 7 ,@@ 4@@ 2 b@@ n over the last two years . 
In this regard , I have t@@ asked the T@@ reas@@ ury with establ@@ ishing a small unit to focus on f@@ ast@@ -@@ tr@@ acking of payments to co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s , 
Sec@@ tors in the province which experi@@ enced particularly strong growth in 200@@ 4 were construction , which gre@@ w at a st@@ agg@@ ering 2@@ 8 ,@@ 8 , 
As at the end of Dec@@ ember 200@@ 5 , I@@ th@@ ala had approved 4@@ 0@@ 5 S@@ M@@ M@@ E business plans wor@@ th R@@ 4@@ 3@@ 3 mil@@ lion . O@@ f this amount over R@@ 1@@ 7@@ 9 mil@@ lion has already been dis@@ bur@@ sed . 
In A@@ pr@@ il 200@@ 6 a det@@ ailed Requ@@ est for Pro@@ pos@@ als will be issued to sel@@ ected b@@ id@@ ders to pre@@ p@@ are more det@@ ailed b@@ ids . B@@ y S@@ ep@@ t@@ ember 200@@ 6 a b@@ id@@ der will be sel@@ ected and det@@ ailed negoti@@ ations will comm@@ ence , 
During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R@@ 200@@ m to I@@ th@@ ala to drive the S@@ M@@ M@@ E programme for the province p@@ ending the fin@@ alisation of a struc@@ tured S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund . 
A provincial supply ch@@ ain management framework policy has been compil@@ ed to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to proc@@ ure goods and services , including from co@@ oper@@ atives , 
In the coming year therefore , we are going to be implementing a new programme to support S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s the details of which I will rev@@ e@@ al shor@@ tly . 
It should come as no sur@@ pr@@ ise therefore , that the budget expenditure pro@@ pos@@ als for 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 recomm@@ ended by Cabinet can be categ@@ or@@ ized into three b@@ road areas which are consistent with the them@@ es which under@@ p@@ in@@ ned last years budget , nam@@ el@@ y@@ : 
for services rend@@ ered and/or suppl@@ ies provided . 
The consequ@@ ence of this is the need to exp@@ and the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development , with more staff employed to provide support cent@@ res in all dis@@ tric@@ ts in collabor@@ ation with municipal initiatives and to streng@@ then Local E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development . 
and the anti@@ cip@@ ated s@@ av@@ ings are as follow@@ s: R@@ 9 ,@@ 4@@ m s@@ av@@ ings per month ; R@@ 1@@ 1@@ 3@@ m s@@ av@@ ings per ann@@ um and R@@ 3@@ 3@@ 8@@ m s@@ av@@ ings over a 3 year period . Fur@@ ther@@ more a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspec@@ t@@ s: 
- this compar@@ es to a growth rate for K@@ Z@@ N in 200@@ 3 of just 2 ,@@ 8 . In 200@@ 5 K@@ Z@@ N@@ s economic growth rate is pro@@ jec@@ ted to be in the region of 5 ,@@ 2 , 
We have wel@@ com@@ ed the laun@@ ch of S@@ m@@ all En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise Development Ag@@ ency as a br@@ and of D@@ T@@ I to support S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s and co@@ ops . 
improv@@ ing the un@@ employment rate from 3@@ 3 .@@ 1 in 200@@ 4 to 3@@ 1 .@@ 8 in 200@@ 5 . This dec@@ rease in un@@ employment was in fact f@@ aster than the national av@@ er@@ age , which dec@@ lin@@ ed from 2@@ 7 .@@ 9 to 2@@ 6 .@@ 5 over the same period . 
C@@ re@@ ating j@@ obs and all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy 
During the year we inv@@ ested R@@ 8@@ 0 mil@@ lion in the social wel@@ f@@ are gr@@ ants investigation which has yi@@ el@@ d@@ ed tr@@ em@@ end@@ ous value to the province . 2@@ 5 ,@@ 9@@ 5@@ 6 fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent gr@@ ants were identified in this investigation 
The deal f@@ low that is currently under consideration by I@@ th@@ ala is standing at R@@ 1 .@@ 5@@ b@@ n . It is safe to sugg@@ est that between R@@ 5@@ 00@@ m to R@@ 1@@ b@@ n of those de@@ als would be wor@@ thy of funding . 
As import@@ antly , the payment process to S@@ M@@ M@@ E@@ s by Government De@@ part@@ ments le@@ aves much to be d@@ esi@@ red . 
 this will have a positive impact on the re@@ viv@@ al of U@@ l@@ undi as a regional centre . 
A ter@@ ti@@ ary co@@ oper@@ ative will provide support to co@@ oper@@ atives through ap@@ e@@ x level institutions . It will also adv@@ oc@@ ate and eng@@ age org@@ ans of state , the private sector and the stak@@ eholders on behalf of its members . 
The second major infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related programme being adv@@ anced by the provincial government rel@@ ates to financial support for the development of s@@ occ@@ er stadi@@ ums in the province in prepar@@ ation for the 20@@ 10 World Cup . 
is that the ter@@ ti@@ ary co@@ oper@@ ative should manage the enti@@ re value ch@@ ain , 
only by u@@ pl@@ if@@ ting the m@@ asses strugg@@ ling to sur@@ vi@@ ve in the second economy will we be able to achieve sus@@ tain@@ ably high@@ er growth rates over the longer term , and h@@ ence our end@@ -@@ go@@ al of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity for all . 
The growth of co@@ oper@@ atives requires a major sh@@ ift in our strategy . Co@@ ops are a community movement . For sus@@ tain@@ ability we need to institu@@ tion@@ alise the co@@ oper@@ atives movement . 
Other infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic projects we pro@@ pose to fund over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F period are the two road cor@@ rid@@ ors lead@@ ing to R@@ ich@@ ards Bay , nam@@ ely the L@@ ub@@ ombo SD@@ I cor@@ rid@@ or and the P@@ 7@@ 00 link@@ ing to U@@ l@@ undi and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely V@@ r@@ y@@ he@@ id .

Agr@@ arian rev@@ olution 
The focus of agr@@ arian rev@@ olution projects and interventions will be on bo@@ os@@ ting the capacity of sec@@ ond@@ ary agricultural co@@ oper@@ atives at the district level 
It must be emphas@@ ised that the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution conc@@ ept is not only about agr@@ iculture . It emb@@ rac@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of development of our rural areas , 
Applic@@ ants who have applied to I@@ th@@ ala for lo@@ ans should not be sur@@ pr@@ ised therefore if their de@@ als end up being fin@@ anced by another financial institution 
A@@ B@@ SA has already indicated a w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to comm@@ it R@@ 2@@ 5@@ m to funding small and mic@@ r@@ o enterprises ne@@ eding lo@@ an fin@@ ance of less than R@@ 3 mil@@ lion . We are also at adv@@ anced st@@ ages of discus@@ sions with Stand@@ ard Bank and F@@ ir@@ st National . 
This document will form the basis for the participation of any other financial institution in the Fund . 
Ac@@ c@@ ess to mar@@ kets 
D@@ isc@@ us@@ sions with F@@ N@@ B have not been fin@@ alised . T@@ ogether with a provincial government contribution of R@@ 200@@ m which we will make available , the int@@ ention is to lev@@ er@@ age total funding of over R@@ 1 ,@@ 5 b@@ n for the S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund by J@@ une 200@@ 6 . 
Our mess@@ age is@@ : 
The Fund is designed as a centr@@ al compon@@ ent of a small enterpr@@ ise l@@ ending framework , which seek@@ s not to comp@@ ete with other commercial S@@ M@@ M@@ E l@@ end@@ ers in the market , 
 the important thing is that all S@@ M@@ M@@ E business lo@@ an applications will be att@@ ended to within the coming year . 
N@@ ote that the funds will be held against the V@@ ote of the Provincial T@@ reas@@ ury p@@ ending dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ement to the S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund . 
The objective is to develop the provinces en@@ or@@ m@@ ous potential in agr@@ iculture into a competi@@ tive advant@@ age by util@@ ising all of its 5@@ 90 bi@@ o-@@ resource reg@@ ions to produce veget@@ ables , fr@@ uit and me@@ at products for export to E@@ u@@ rop@@ e ,

A@@ noth@@ er key second economy intervention is that of the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution , whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to m@@ ove sub@@ s@@ ist@@ ence farm@@ ers up@@ wards towards the first economy . 
B@@ us@@ iness Par@@ t@@ ners in collabor@@ ation with Kh@@ ula , will work with I@@ th@@ ala to open access to I@@ th@@ ala applic@@ ants to the R@@ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ m start up capital for S@@ M@@ M@@ E and B@@ E@@ E funding . 
Ac@@ c@@ ess to support for land re@@ form benefici@@ aries , and 
to reduce the rel@@ iance on the import@@ ation of basic fo@@ od@@ st@@ u@@ ff@@ s and to bring down food pr@@ ices through a com@@ prehensive support programme for emerg@@ ing farm@@ ers which will facilit@@ ate: 
Div@@ ision of revenue framework and re@@ vis@@ ed provincial al@@ loc@@ ations over the M@@ T@@ E@@ F 
demonstr@@ ating governments ong@@ oing commitment to improv@@ ing the quality and re@@ ach of education . The budget includes additional funding in

and is a first st@@ ep towards al@@ ig@@ ning service delivery provision between the local and provincial s@@ pher@@ es of government . 
The Department of Community Safety & L@@ i@@ ais@@ on rece@@ ives R@@ 50 ,@@ 8 mil@@ lion this year , an increase of 5 .@@ 5 per cent . As the department received a substantial additional al@@ location last year , there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget .

which provides access to mar@@ kets 
and anti@@ fr@@ au@@ d and cor@@ ruption measures aimed at stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ing the driv@@ ers and learners licence system . N@@ ote that the department rece@@ ives very substantial increas@@ es in this budget in the outer two years of the M@@ T@@ E@@ F . 
This includes additional funding in the amount of R@@ 7@@ 0 mil@@ lion for maintenance , new road works and access br@@ id@@ ges , 
In particular , the unit will work clos@@ ely with the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development , the Regional Off@@ ices of the Land C@@ la@@ im@@ s Commission and Land Affairs , and other provincial departments

There is a growing need for government to inter@@ v@@ ene in the second economy through our instrum@@ ent for economic empow@@ erment , I@@ th@@ ala . Wh@@ ile much has been achieved in the last year 
N@@ ote that all funding in the P@@ overty Al@@ lev@@ iation Fund has been allocated to specific departments , while specific al@@ loc@@ ations have also been made to various departments

I tur@@ n now to the expenditure pro@@ pos@@ als . In line with established practice and sound financial principles , the province is aim@@ ing at a bal@@ anced budget for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year 
In respect of the total budget al@@ loc@@ ations for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year@@ : 
O@@ ver and above this , most departments will be receiving additional funding over the M@@ T@@ E@@ F for specific purposes and projects , as indicated in Table 3 in the prin@@ ted spe@@ ech . 
with a view to ens@@ uring the sus@@ tain@@ ability of the 20 major land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion projects around the province . A T@@ ask Te@@ am coordin@@ ated by the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Techn@@ ical Cl@@ us@@ ter of Cabinet has already been established 
T@@ reas@@ ury has eng@@ aged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate mod@@ el for the planning , co@@ ord@@ ination , and approval of the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution projects . 
while service delivery issues and capacity constraints are also addres@@ sed in the budget pro@@ pos@@ als . 
An amount of R@@ 4@@ 0@@ m will be allocated to the Department of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development in the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit . 
R@@ 2@@ 8@@ 0 mil@@ lion for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure ;

R@@ 1@@ 10 mil@@ lion to streng@@ then the F@@ ET col@@ leg@@ es ; and 
Inv@@ esting in re@@ viv@@ al of town@@ ship economies 
The budget pro@@ pos@@ als will sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment , job cre@@ ation , poverty all@@ ev@@ iation , and broad@@ er participation in the economy 
from communities and interest groups across the province we are left with the firm im@@ pres@@ sion that this is tr@@ ul@@ y a budget for the people by the people of the province . 
N@@ ote that the amoun@@ ts per project are the total su@@ m over the three years of the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F period . It should also be no@@ ted that 
G@@ iven the limited resources , substantial re@@ prior@@ iti@@ z@@ ation and trad@@ e@@ off@@ s had to be made this is of course the ess@@ ence of what the bud@@ g@@ eting process is all about . 
is the single most important imp@@ ed@@ im@@ ent to vi@@ ability and sus@@ tain@@ ability , and this aspec@@ t will be a major focus area of I@@ th@@ al@@ as Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development Unit and the other rol@@ e-@@ players mentioned . 
I@@ th@@ ala is therefore in the process of establ@@ ishing a new business unit called Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development Unit , which will facilitate delivery in the following are@@ as@@ : 
The Department of S@@ port & Rec@@ re@@ ation is allocated a budget of R@@ 10@@ 6 ,@@ 1 mil@@ lion , a 1@@ 9 .@@ 3 per cent increase over last year . 
and requires a high d@@ eg@@ ree of co@@ ord@@ ination and cooperation between various provincial departments and district municipalities . The Department of Trans@@ ports African Ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance Road U@@ p@@ gr@@ ading Programme , 
Once again Minister T@@ rev@@ or Man@@ u@@ el and the Te@@ am Fin@@ ance have provided inv@@ al@@ u@@ able adv@@ ice and guid@@ ance on the technical issues and national budget framework which under@@ p@@ in this budget . 
As expl@@ ained this dec@@ rease is attr@@ ib@@ ut@@ able to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget . The department n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess rece@@ ives 
F@@ ac@@ ilit@@ ation of new investment and increas@@ ed trade within the Provin@@ ce 
However , the quality of information received from departments in their budget sub@@ mis@@ sions in terms of their sp@@ ati@@ al sp@@ ending and service delivery g@@ aps was rel@@ atively in@@ complete and in@@ adequate . 
The bud@@ g@@ eted revenue for 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 is made up as follow@@ s: 
the provincial budget ac@@ tually grow@@ s by 1@@ 3 .@@ 4 per cent over last years main budget , again exclud@@ ing the social security grant funding . This is not an in@@ consider@@ able increase , 
In his medi@@ um term budget policy statement , the Minister of Fin@@ ance t@@ abled the div@@ ision of revenue between the three government s@@ pher@@ es . 
There are many people who contribu@@ ted to the budget pro@@ pos@@ als which we table today . The support provided by the Premier H@@ on J@@ S Nd@@ eb@@ ele and my Cabinet Col@@ leag@@ ues is most sin@@ cer@@ ely appreci@@ ated . 
T@@ ot@@ al funding request by departments 
will be coll@@ ec@@ tively sp@@ ending no less than R@@ 3@@ b@@ n over the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ T@@ E@@ F on comb@@ ating HIV and A@@ ID@@ S , including the further exp@@ an@@ sion and rol@@ l@@ out of the P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al and hom@@ e-@@ based care programmes 
Ex@@ pan@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improv@@ ing service delivery 
Health is allocated a budget of R@@ 11 ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 7 billion , an increase of 1@@ 3 .@@ 1 per cent . This rel@@ atively large per@@ cent@@ age increase refl@@ ects the high pri@@ ority which government , both national and provincial , 
but H@@ op@@ e sm@@ il@@ es at the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing , it will be happ@@ ier The 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 Provincial budget process 
For the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F , a total of R@@ 9 ,@@ 7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments . This is against a total of R@@ 4 ,@@ 6 billion available in the provincial resource en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e . 
In short , I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proc@@ eed , on sch@@ edule , along our jour@@ ney to pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity for all . 
E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development g@@ ets R@@ 3@@ 90 ,@@ 1 mil@@ lion in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , a 1@@ 7@@ 7 per cent increase over last year . Be@@ fore I am acc@@ used of ne@@ pot@@ ism , let me dr@@ aw attention to the fact that 
who have once again have played a most construc@@ tive role in engag@@ ing with T@@ reas@@ ury on bud@@ get@@ ary and financial management issues . 
K@@ Z@@ N@@ s share of additional funding 
The third area which government is prior@@ it@@ ising in this budget rel@@ ates to exp@@ and@@ ing and improv@@ ing the quality of existing programmes and projects . O@@ f note are the following al@@ loc@@ ation@@ s: 
and outer two years of the M@@ T@@ E@@ F period . The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 financial year , nam@@ ely R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 2 billion , is allocated to the various provincial departments . 
Be@@ fore H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members become al@@ armed , however , I should expl@@ ain that the dec@@ rease is enti@@ rel@@ y attr@@ ib@@ ut@@ able to the removal of the social security cond@@ itional grant funding from the provincial bud@@ g@@ ets al@@ together 
This exercise rev@@ e@@ al@@ ed that ind@@ eed we are funding these national prior@@ ities more than adequ@@ ately , and all the national pri@@ ority programmes have been allocated heal@@ thy increas@@ es in their bas@@ el@@ ine bud@@ g@@ ets over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F . 
in accordance with their legislative m@@ and@@ ates and any sec@@ tor@@ -@@ specific nor@@ ms and standards . 
It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget sub@@ mis@@ sions . If noth@@ ing el@@ se , this approach has b@@ roug@@ ht about a change in the m@@ ind@@ set of departments 
For the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year , the province is bud@@ g@@ eting for total revenue of R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 1 billion . This re@@ presents a dec@@ rease of 18 ,@@ 4 per cent as compar@@ ed to last years main budget . 
E@@ P@@ W@@ P and B@@ B@@ B@@ E@@ E principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and maint@@ en@@ anc@@ e-@@ related projects . 
This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department , in the amount of R@@ 18 ,@@ 9 mil@@ lion , as well as R@@ 4@@ m for the carr@@ y-@@ through costs of the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments esti@@ m@@ ate . 
R@@ 2@@ 90 mil@@ lion for Ad@@ ul@@ t Bas@@ ic Education & Training ; 
in terms of the number of new ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s enter@@ ing the market , there is a need to create better focus within I@@ th@@ ala in order to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate delivery in this all important empow@@ erment initi@@ ative . 
The R@@ oy@@ al Hous@@ eh@@ old rece@@ ives R@@ 3@@ 1 ,@@ 4 mil@@ lion in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , an increase of 1@@ 3 .@@ 8 per cent over last year . 
to R@@ 1@@ 3 ,@@ 8@@ 3@@ 2 b@@ n in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 compar@@ ed to R@@ 12 ,@@ 7@@ 7@@ 1 b@@ n in the current year . 
additional funding tot@@ all@@ ing R@@ 9@@ 7 ,@@ 5@@ m as a result of the ph@@ as@@ ing in of the F@@ ood Rel@@ ief and HIV and A@@ ID@@ S gr@@ ants . Although not in our budget the cond@@ itional grant for social assistance gr@@ ants 
I am conf@@ ident however that we have succ@@ e@@ eded in form@@ ul@@ ating budget pro@@ pos@@ als which tr@@ ul@@ y refl@@ ect the provincial policy prior@@ ities as approved by the provincial executive , and will go a long way towards satis@@ f@@ ying the as@@ pir@@ ations of popul@@ ar expec@@ t@@ ations . 
and the HIV and A@@ ID@@ S cond@@ itional gr@@ ants into the equ@@ itable share . For 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , R@@ 3@@ 9@@ 7 mil@@ lion is available for dis@@ cre@@ tion@@ ary sp@@ ending , r@@ ising to R@@ 3 .@@ 2 billion in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 .

The number of benefici@@ aries in year 200@@ 0@@ /@@ 0@@ 1 was 6@@ 21 ,@@ 4@@ 9@@ 4 compar@@ ed to 1 ,@@ 8@@ 36 ,@@ 9@@ 75 in year 200@@ 4@@ /@@ 0@@ 5 . 
for the carr@@ y-@@ through costs of the Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate al@@ loc@@ ations last year , and R@@ 9 ,@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 6 ,@@ 7@@ m for cat@@ ering for cultural aff@@ airs and office administrative costs respec@@ tively . 
R@@ 5@@ 8 mil@@ lion to develop commun@@ al agricultural infrastructure ; 
The social services are once again prior@@ it@@ ised in terms of the growth rates in their M@@ T@@ E@@ F al@@ loc@@ ations , 
The purpose of this sp@@ ati@@ al exercise was to m@@ ove towards att@@ aining a com@@ prehensive economic al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment strategy for the province , by tr@@ ying to identify provincial departments sp@@ ending

Mr Speaker , I tur@@ n now to the det@@ ail of the provincial budget pro@@ pos@@ als for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ T@@ E@@ F . 
Mr Speaker , we remain committed for example to continue wag@@ ing a rel@@ ent@@ less campaign to comb@@ at the r@@ av@@ ag@@ ing effec@@ ts of the HIV and A@@ ID@@ S sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome on our society . To this end provincial departments 
And dem@@ and@@ ing , because p@@ ut@@ ting bud@@ g@@ ets together , which involv@@ es making informed cho@@ ices and mat@@ ching limited resources against comp@@ eting needs and dem@@ ands , is never an eas@@ y process . 
for the carr@@ y@@ - through costs of the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments esti@@ m@@ ate , new pos@@ ts and I@@ T support and systems . 
I also wish to ext@@ end my than@@ ks to the Chairperson of the Fin@@ ance and E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Affairs P@@ or@@ t@@ fol@@ io Committee , Mr C@@ y@@ r@@ il X@@ aba and his Committee , 
Mr Speaker , compil@@ ing these budget pro@@ pos@@ als has been both a pl@@ eas@@ ur@@ able and dem@@ and@@ ing task . P@@ le@@ as@@ ur@@ able , in that there has been tr@@ em@@ end@@ ously positive in@@ put and adv@@ ice received 
R@@ 2@@ 9@@ m for the Community Development Wor@@ k@@ ers programme , R@@ 24 ,@@ 1 mil@@ lion for Pro@@ ject Con@@ sol@@ id@@ ate , Dis@@ aster Management C@@ ent@@ res and the R@@ ural Con@@ nec@@ tiv@@ ity Programme , 
The Hous@@ ing budget record@@ s a substantial le@@ ap to R@@ 1 ,@@ 2@@ 5@@ 2 billion , an increase of no less than 29 .@@ 1 per cent over last year . 
and there is little dou@@ b@@ t that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliv@@ er on its m@@ and@@ ate to the elec@@ tor@@ ate . 
 this funding has been trans@@ fer@@ red to the new@@ ly established Social Security Ag@@ ency at a national level . T@@ aking out the social security grant funding of some R@@ 1@@ 3 ,@@ 8@@ b@@ n in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , 
The Department of Wor@@ ks rece@@ ives R@@ 4@@ 5@@ 1 ,@@ 5 mil@@ lion this year , an increase of 6 .@@ 0 per cent over the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 budget . 
This includes additional funding of R@@ 1@@ 10@@ m as mentioned for the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution programme , 
The main reason for the dec@@ rease is that T@@ reas@@ ury will no longer have the centr@@ alised P@@ overty Al@@ lev@@ iation Fund held against its budget , 
The Provincial T@@ reas@@ ury rece@@ ives R@@ 1 ,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 9 billion , a nom@@ inal dec@@ rease of 1 .@@ 8 per cent over last years main budget . 
The primary focus of the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 T@@ reas@@ ury Gu@@ id@@ elines was on the review and re@@ prior@@ it@@ isation of departments bud@@ g@@ ets , as well as on an analys@@ is of their sp@@ ati@@ al sp@@ ending and service delivery in each district municipality . 
The expenditure framework provides for R@@ 3@@ 1 billion in additional equ@@ itable share al@@ location to the provinces over the M@@ T@@ E@@ F . 
while even the bal@@ ance of the Provincial G@@ row@@ th Fund and S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund will only be ho@@ used in T@@ reas@@ ur@@ y@@ s budget on a temporary basis , p@@ ending approval of projects and consequ@@ ent transfer of funds to the I@@ th@@ ala 
 this is the total expenditure across the De@@ part@@ ments of Health , Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are and Education . The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty all@@ ev@@ iation programmes in their respective budget documentation . 
The Department of Ar@@ ts , C@@ ul@@ ture and Tourism rece@@ ives a budget of R@@ 2@@ 5@@ 4 ,@@ 7 mil@@ lion , a 21 .@@ 6 per cent increase over last year . This includes an additional al@@ location of R@@ 18 ,@@ 7 mil@@ lion 
with the m@@ and@@ ate to ensure that the commercial enterprises ear@@ mar@@ ked for the major land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion projects such as g@@ ame farm@@ ing and ec@@ ot@@ ourism , 
R@@ 4@@ 0@@ m for the Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated Development Unit in I@@ th@@ ala , and R@@ 20@@ m for the D@@ ube Trade P@@ ort . Pre@@ vi@@ ously these funds were k@@ ept in T@@ reas@@ ury before they were trans@@ fer@@ red to I@@ th@@ ala . 
Mr Speaker , I have deal@@ t at leng@@ th with the major policy prior@@ ities and therefore I wish to brief@@ ly expl@@ ain the div@@ ision of revenue and M@@ T@@ E@@ F framework which under@@ p@@ ins this provincial budget . 
The Office of the Premier is allocated R 2@@ 9@@ 4 ,@@ 7 mil@@ lion , an increase of 3@@ 5 .@@ 1 per cent over the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 budget . This large increase is mainly attr@@ ib@@ ut@@ able to an al@@ location of R@@ 5@@ 0@@ m 
The Department of Local Government and Tr@@ ad@@ itional Affairs g@@ ets R@@ 5@@ 9@@ 5 ,@@ 6 mil@@ lion , a 29 .@@ 9 per cent increase . 
Other key rol@@ e-@@ players include the De@@ part@@ ments of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Development , Hous@@ ing , Ar@@ ts , C@@ ul@@ ture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land C@@ la@@ im@@ s Commission . 
We are also recomm@@ ending additional al@@ loc@@ ations in order to help departments increase their inter@@ nal capacity and improve service delivery . 
continues to acc@@ ord to the delivery of social services , and includes an additional al@@ location of R@@ 24 ,@@ 6 mil@@ lion for improv@@ ing maintenance in hos@@ pit@@ als . 
Mr Speaker , I want to emphas@@ ise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for al@@ location should be ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ed among departments and programmes , we did a com@@ prehensive cos@@ ting and ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king exercise 
Ex@@ p@@ end@@ it@@ ure pro@@ pos@@ als and depart@@ mental al@@ loc@@ ations 
This al@@ location will also support the regul@@ atory activities of the G@@ amb@@ ling Board . A request from the Department of Hous@@ ing for additional capacity has also been recomm@@ ended to support various initiatives such as training of housing benefici@@ aries . 
Table 1 in the prin@@ ted spe@@ ech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further al@@ location , taking into account pro@@ jec@@ ted provincial own revenue and two national policy direc@@ tives ;

Section 2@@ 5 author@@ ises M@@ E@@ C@@ s to establish coastal set@@ back lin@@ es . 
The Act also requires municipalities to develop municipal CM@@ P@@ s within four years of the Ac@@ ts comm@@ enc@@ ement , either as stand al@@ one documents or as part of an integrated development plan prepar@@ ed in accordance with the Municipal S@@ ystems Act . 
In the past , the value of coastal ecos@@ ystems as a cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one for development was not suff@@ ici@@ ently acknowled@@ ged in dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making in South Africa . 
The Bill int@@ ends to regul@@ ate the dis@@ charge of eff@@ lu@@ ent into coastal wat@@ ers from any sour@@ ce on land by requir@@ ing permits to author@@ ise such dis@@ charges . 
However , it was decided that coastal prot@@ ected areas would gener@@ ally be managed under the Prot@@ ected A@@ re@@ as Act rather than the proposed Int@@ egr@@ ated Co@@ astal Management Act . 
The purpose of this Gu@@ ide is to facilitate mean@@ ing@@ ful and informed public participation during the 90 day comm@@ ents period . 
The Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er did not m@@ er@@ ely provide a v@@ ision , principles , go@@ als and objectives for coastal management in South Africa .

This is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jo@@ int@@ ly by several org@@ ans of State inst@@ e@@ ad of many separate author@@ is@@ ations .

The Bill author@@ ises the Minister to disp@@ ense with prescribed procedure in respect of d@@ ump@@ ing in emerg@@ encies . For example , v@@ ess@@ els in distr@@ ess due to m@@ ech@@ an@@ ical fail@@ ure may need to urg@@ ently d@@ um@@ p c@@ arg@@ o over@@ board . 
The Bill provides procedures relating to both dis@@ charge and d@@ ump@@ ing permits . 
This Par@@ t also provides str@@ ict guidelines for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making which the permit issu@@ ing authority must consider . 
Section 5@@ 7 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occup@@ i@@ ers of land , coastal manag@@ ers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avo@@ id ca@@ using adv@@ erse effec@@ ts on the coastal environment 
The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CM@@ P@@ s with@@ in@@ four years of the comm@@ enc@@ ement of the Act that are consistent with the national CM@@ P and the National Est@@ u@@ ar@@ ine Management Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l . 
Prot@@ ected areas or parts there@@ of are aut@@ om@@ atic@@ ally included in the bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one in terms of Section 16 . The purpose of section 2@@ 2 is to enable the M@@ EC 
Par@@ t 4 de@@ als with the let@@ ting of coastal public property by way of coastal le@@ as@@ es and the gran@@ ting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal conc@@ es@@ sions . 
This contr@@ as@@ ts with the current situation under the Se@@ ash@@ or@@ e Act where the se@@ ash@@ or@@ e and se@@ a are owned by the President on behalf of the people .@@ Co@@ astal public property is made up pr@@ im@@ arily of the se@@ ash@@ or@@ e and coastal wat@@ ers . 
After the Cabinet approved the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er a com@@ prehensive legal review was carried out . I@@ ts purpose was to determine whether the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er could be implemented in terms of existing laws . 
E@@ arly dr@@ af@@ ts of the Int@@ egr@@ ated Co@@ astal Management Bill included det@@ ailed provisions dealing with coastal prot@@ ected areas . 
Section 3@@ 5 establ@@ ishes a National Co@@ astal Committee which will function at national government level . Section 36 author@@ iz@@ es the Minister to determine the com@@ position of the Committee . 
Section 4@@ 0 author@@ iz@@ es the M@@ E@@ C@@ s to appoin@@ t V@@ olun@@ t@@ ary coastal officers and def@@ ine their rol@@ es and responsib@@ ilities . 
The prot@@ o@@ co@@ l will provide a national policy for es@@ tu@@ ary management and gu@@ ide the development of individual es@@ tu@@ ar@@ ine management plans . 
D@@ em@@ ar@@ c@@ ation procedures to change the bo@@ und@@ aries of the coastal bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one are only lik@@ ely to be institu@@ ted where the area designated by the Act is in@@ appropriate and imp@@ ed@@ es effective coastal management . 
This provision hel@@ ps facilitate a new co@@ oper@@ ative and particip@@ atory approach to manag@@ ing the co@@ ast by enh@@ anc@@ ing the participation of members of the public in coastal management . 
In@@ clud@@ es: v@@ ision , provincial CM@@ O@@ s . 
The coastal resource use planning system established by this Ch@@ apter will function as a mechanis@@ m for control@@ ling the use of the coastal z@@ one in the same way as the land use planning system is present@@ ly used . 
The responsib@@ ilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental fac@@ tors . 
It took a st@@ ep further by providing a Pl@@ an of Ac@@ tion which out@@ lin@@ es in det@@ ail how the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er is to be implemented . One of the el@@ ements of this Pl@@ an of Ac@@ tion is In@@ stitutional and Leg@@ al Development . 
However , this system ori@@ ent@@ ated approach has f@@ ailed to mater@@ i@@ al@@ ize to date and various sectors of government continue to adop@@ t a management approach foc@@ using 
Co@@ astal wat@@ ers are ess@@ enti@@ ally all wat@@ ers influ@@ enced by ti@@ d@@ es and the se@@ a out to the lim@@ its of the terr@@ itor@@ ial se@@ a . 
rather than as conserv@@ ation areas . For example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable har@@ v@@ esting of sh@@ ell@@ fish for sub@@ s@@ ist@@ ence purposes in areas where such har@@ v@@ esting is present@@ ly de@@ pl@@ eting the sh@@ ell@@ fish resources . 
Section 5@@ 9 provides for the Minister or M@@ EC to issue written no@@ ti@@ ces requir@@ ing measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment . 
The Minister poin@@ ted out that due to its compl@@ ex@@ ity the Bill would be available for public com@@ ment for a period of 90 days . 
This Bill promot@@ es a hol@@ istic way of th@@ ink@@ ing by promoting coordin@@ ated and integrated coastal management , which views the co@@ ast as a system and emphas@@ iz@@ es the importance of manag@@ ing it as such . 
The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was esti@@ m@@ ated in 1998 to be about R@@ 1@@ 6@@ 8 billion ann@@ ually , which was equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to about 3@@ 5 of our annual G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Produc@@ t .

For coastal development to be ec@@ olog@@ ically sustainable , it should inv@@ olve protection of coastal ecos@@ ystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources . 
The author@@ isation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment . 
Par@@ t 3 pro@@ hib@@ its the under@@ taking of certain activities within coastal public property and the ex@@ clusive economic z@@ one without a permit . 
For coastal development to be econom@@ ically sustainable it should div@@ er@@ sif@@ y opportunities , provide j@@ obs and facilitate access to produc@@ tive resources . 
Ph@@ ot@@ o: eThekwini Municipality 
A special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encour@@ age sustainable development in particular areas , 
Section 6@@ 8 is intended to facilitate the progres@@ sive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for gran@@ ting permits for the use of coastal resources while maint@@ aining a high level of environmental protection . 
The current land@@ -@@ use planning system in South Africa is a land@@ -based system that ess@@ enti@@ ally st@@ ops at the high water mark . 
The Bill requires the Minister to develop a national action list to scre@@ en waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .

The responsib@@ ilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are des@@ cribed in section 20 . In the past infrastructure for access to the se@@ a was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental fac@@ tors .

At least one from the S@@ otho group ; 
Section 6 of the Constitution provides the prin@@ cip@@ al legal framework for mul@@ til@@ ing@@ u@@ alism , the development of the official languages and the promotion of respect 
I believe that coll@@ ec@@ tively we have to ensure that the policy becomes a re@@ ality in our lives , af@@ firm@@ ing and making us pro@@ ud of our un@@ ique South African identity . 
The official languages will be used in all legislative activities , including H@@ ans@@ ard publ@@ ications ,

The d@@ ti bel@@ iev@@ es that large trans@@ actions involv@@ ing large businesses and the State do not require the protection off@@ ered by the Bill because they would benefit from the fl@@ ex@@ ib@@ ility of operating in an un@@ regul@@ ated market . Th@@ ere@@ fore , the Bill will not apply to trans@@ actions when the cons@@ um@@ er is the State , or any organ of state ;
New provisions in cl@@ ause 4@@ 5 aim to ensure f@@ air@@ ness in a@@ uc@@ tions by regul@@ ating the participation of owners or their ag@@ ents as b@@ id@@ ders , and requir@@ ing notice of any res@@ erve b@@ id or up@@ set pr@@ ice .

In addition , there is a general pro@@ hib@@ ition against cons@@ um@@ ers being sub@@ jec@@ ted to un@@ fair discrimin@@ ation when they are enter@@ ing into a trans@@ action or agreement , and in all aspec@@ ts of the conduct of the suppl@@ ier towards the cons@@ um@@ er in the course of the trans@@ action .
The Bill identif@@ ies the following el@@ ements that make a trans@@ action a cons@@ um@@ er trans@@ action , and th@@ us br@@ ing@@ ing it within the s@@ cope of the Bill if it is an inter@@ action or agreement to inter@@ act between a cons@@ um@@ er and suppl@@ ier in the ordinary course of the suppl@@ i@@ ers business , including in terms of any public regul@@ ation ;

C@@ ause 60 cre@@ ates a framework for industry c@@ od@@ es to be developed , establ@@ ishing sch@@ em@@ es of product safety monitoring and , if needed , product rec@@ all .
