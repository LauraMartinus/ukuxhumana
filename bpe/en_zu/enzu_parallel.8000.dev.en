And early the next morning , the young women carried him back down to the well again .
No , they said .
Well le@@ ts see if my sec@@ re@@ t ad@@ m@@ ire@@ r will come and f@@ et@@ ch me ? said S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en when she saw the pur@@ se full of money .

What do we do now ? the Su@@ n Chief asked his w@@ ife , but the Mo@@ on L@@ ad@@ y was@@ n@@ t interested in his problems .
It was at this point , when K@@ im@@ ana was just beg@@ inning to l@@ ose all hope of ever get@@ ting his letter deliv@@ ered , that F@@ ro@@ g appro@@ ached him .
An Ad@@ m@@ ire@@ r
You may marr@@ y my d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter if you come and f@@ et@@ ch her , K@@ im@@ ana mo@@ an@@ ed , read@@ ing the Su@@ n Chiefs second letter .
Th@@ en you took a pur@@ se full of money , which was very br@@ ave of you , but I re@@ ally don@@ t believe you can f@@ et@@ ch S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en , too .
K@@ im@@ ana was a young man in lo@@ ve .
Y@@ o@@ ul@@ l take a pur@@ se full of money up to heav@@ en ? said K@@ im@@ ana .
After the Su@@ n Chief had de@@ par@@ ted , F@@ ro@@ g put the letter in his m@@ outh , cl@@ imb@@ ed into an emp@@ ty j@@ ug and wa@@ ited to be carried back down to E@@ ar@@ th .
R@@ ab@@ b@@ it , he asked , would you be so kind as to take this letter to the Su@@ n Chief for me , please ?
So the Su@@ n Chief w@@ ro@@ te a re@@ ply des@@ crib@@ ing his d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ters request then left it on the table next to the water j@@ ugs .
C@@ an a f@@ ro@@ g lead a woman ? she asked .
D@@ on@@ t ask me !

When the young women w@@ er@@ ent look@@ ing F@@ ro@@ g j@@ ump@@ ed into one of the j@@ ugs where he st@@ ay@@ ed h@@ id@@ den until they cl@@ imb@@ ed back up to heav@@ en .
After g@@ iving the matter some th@@ ought he decided that the best thing to do was to wr@@ ite a letter to the Su@@ n Chief sim@@ ply st@@ ating his wish .
And K@@ im@@ ana ?
D@@ id you put this letter in my room ? he asked .
Th@@ en I b@@ roug@@ ht you a pur@@ se full of money .
F@@ ir@@ st I took a letter to He@@ av@@ en , d@@ id@@ n@@ t I ?
Th@@ en I@@ ll f@@ et@@ ch her for you , said F@@ ro@@ g .

H@@ ow can this be ?
Ar@@ e you m@@ ad ?
F@@ ir@@ st you took a letter to He@@ av@@ en .
Th@@ en its you that I shall marr@@ y , she said , not my sec@@ re@@ t ad@@ m@@ ire@@ r .
And after that I go@@ t you to come down to E@@ ar@@ th .
No way !
Well , at least I@@ ll try , he said .
Af@@ ter@@ wards , F@@ ro@@ g took the letter to K@@ im@@ ana .
N@@ ot long af@@ ter@@ wards the Su@@ n Chief came into his room for a dr@@ ink of water , saw the letter then sum@@ mon@@ ed the young women who had been down to the well for him .
As@@ k your d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter ! she m@@ ut@@ tered .
What must I do now ? he asked .
The S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en look@@ ed at him .
So the Su@@ n Chief w@@ ro@@ te a second letter , which he left on the table , just as before .
Well , h@@ es still look@@ ing for a w@@ ife , I@@ m a@@ fr@@ aid .
Im@@ pres@@ sed , the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en th@@ ought about this for a mom@@ ent .
Yes , of course , prot@@ ested F@@ ro@@ g .
H@@ O@@ W F@@ R@@ O@@ G W@@ EN@@ T T@@ O H@@ E@@ A@@ V@@ E@@ N
So , for the third time F@@ ro@@ g cl@@ imb@@ ed back into the well and the next morning the young women came with their j@@ ugs and carried him up to heav@@ en , but this time , when he was al@@ one he sp@@ at in all the j@@ ugs of water - P@@ tu@@ i .
After that , F@@ ro@@ g and the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en retur@@ ned to heav@@ en together where they were married and l@@ ived happ@@ ily ever after .
What K@@ im@@ ana d@@ id@@ n@@ t know was that F@@ ro@@ g l@@ ived near a well that the young women who serv@@ ed the Su@@ n Chief visited every day .
F@@ ro@@ g , who was a f@@ ro@@ g of few words , m@@ er@@ ely sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged .
Ag@@ ain , K@@ im@@ ana th@@ ought about F@@ ro@@ g@@ s offer .
As@@ k your d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter ! s@@ n@@ app@@ ed Mo@@ on L@@ ad@@ y .
H@@ ow F@@ ro@@ g went to He@@ av@@ en
In the end , K@@ im@@ ana tur@@ ned to his fri@@ end R@@ ab@@ b@@ it for help .
What ?
So he went to his w@@ ife again .
However , the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en was the d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter of the Su@@ n Chief , who was a very pow@@ er@@ ful and important person and for this reason K@@ im@@ ana was@@ n@@ t qu@@ ite sure how to proc@@ eed with his cour@@ tsh@@ i@@ p .
In heav@@ en , the young women placed the water j@@ ugs in the Su@@ n Chiefs room then left .
No , I@@ m a@@ fr@@ aid th@@ ats not possible .
K@@ im@@ ana look@@ ed at F@@ ro@@ g for a mom@@ ent then he sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged .
Th@@ en he went to H@@ aw@@ k who off@@ ered to take it half way , but no further , which was@@ n@@ t re@@ ally much help , of course .
Re@@ ad this , he said , hand@@ ing her the letter .
T@@ ake it to heav@@ en ?
Now he has sent an ev@@ il spirit in the shap@@ e of a f@@ ro@@ g and this is the cause of all the s@@ ick@@ ness .
The next morning F@@ ro@@ g h@@ id in the well again , only this time inst@@ e@@ ad of having a letter in his m@@ outh , he had a pur@@ se full of money .
D@@ id you bring me this pur@@ se full of money today ? he asked them .
Ag@@ ain , F@@ ro@@ g put the letter in his m@@ outh and cl@@ imb@@ ed into an emp@@ ty j@@ ug .
Well , what have I go@@ t to l@@ ose ? he said fin@@ ally , hand@@ ing over the letter .
Th@@ en he went to see the young women who had been down to E@@ ar@@ th to f@@ et@@ ch water for him .
O@@ K , he said fin@@ ally , re@@ aching under his j@@ ack@@ et .
O@@ K , then I@@ ll take it for you , said F@@ ro@@ g .
T@@ ake your letter to heav@@ en ? he said .
R@@ ab@@ b@@ it star@@ ed at him like he had g@@ one off his head .
I c@@ ant go and f@@ et@@ ch her .
But K@@ im@@ ana sh@@ ook his head .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly the same thing happ@@ ened : the young women who serv@@ ed the Su@@ n Chief cl@@ imb@@ ed down from heav@@ en sing@@ ing their s@@ ong and when they low@@ ered their water j@@ ugs into the well , F@@ ro@@ g j@@ ump@@ ed into one .
Please take it to heav@@ en for me .
Well , at least I@@ ll try , answ@@ ered F@@ ro@@ g .
And so the next day , the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en went down to the well with the serv@@ ing gir@@ ls , but she st@@ ay@@ ed behind when all the other young women retur@@ ned to heav@@ en .
Ang@@ ola , which is roug@@ hl@@ y the same size as South Africa but has only about on@@ e-@@ quar@@ ter the population , is situated to the nor@@ th of B@@ ot@@ s@@ wana and Nam@@ ib@@ ia .
I am human and live on E@@ ar@@ th and I want to marr@@ y your d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter , S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en .
The next morning , the same young women coll@@ ected the water j@@ ugs - including the one cont@@ aining F@@ ro@@ g - and cl@@ imb@@ ed down to E@@ ar@@ th , sing@@ ing their s@@ ong as they went G@@ ood day to you , my sis@@ ter .
And , just as before , F@@ ro@@ g ended up in the Su@@ n Chiefs room , where he sp@@ at out the pur@@ se full of money and then h@@ id in a cor@@ ner .
Wh@@ y don@@ t you take the letter y@@ our@@ self ?
And when F@@ ro@@ g was qu@@ ite certain that he was al@@ one he j@@ ump@@ ed out of the j@@ ug , sp@@ it the letter onto the table and h@@ id in a cor@@ ner .
They all sh@@ ook their he@@ ads .
I c@@ ant do that , he said , sh@@ aking his head .
He was in lo@@ ve with the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en , whom he wanted to marr@@ y .
So he next went to An@@ tel@@ op@@ e who also ref@@ used to deliv@@ er the letter .
When the people of the house dr@@ ank the water from the well they all became so s@@ ick the Su@@ n Chief had to summ@@ on a spirit doc@@ tor who first exam@@ ined all the evidence then said , You prom@@ ised your d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter to a man of E@@ ar@@ th , but she has not g@@ one .
K@@ im@@ ana look@@ ed at him in amaz@@ ement .
As@@ k your d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter ! said Mo@@ on L@@ ad@@ y , ir@@ r@@ it@@ ably w@@ aving him away with her hand .
P@@ tu@@ i before h@@ id@@ ing in a cor@@ ner of the room again .
H@@ aving fin@@ ished his letter , K@@ im@@ ana then had to get it deliv@@ ered , which was eas@@ ier said than done because the Su@@ n Chief and his d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter both l@@ ived in heav@@ en .
She had only been wa@@ iting a few mom@@ ents when F@@ ro@@ g cl@@ imb@@ ed out of the well and s@@ at in front of her .
Wh@@ at@@ ever I was asked to do , I did .
I will go down to E@@ ar@@ th , the S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en said when her f@@ ather told her what the spirit doc@@ tor had said .
L@@ ets ask the writ@@ er to bring me a w@@ ed@@ ding g@@ ift , said S@@ k@@ y Ma@@ id@@ en a short while later after she too had read the letter .
When they low@@ ered their j@@ ugs into the well to ref@@ ill them , F@@ ro@@ g j@@ ump@@ ed out .
J@@ ust after d@@ ay@@ bre@@ ak the young women cl@@ imb@@ ed down out of the sk@@ y and visited the well sing@@ ing the s@@ ong they always s@@ ang when they coll@@ ected water - G@@ ood day to you , my sis@@ ter .
He only cl@@ imb@@ ed out of the well when the young women had g@@ one back to heav@@ en .
L@@ u@@ anda , the capital , is a large se@@ a port on the A@@ tl@@ an@@ tic co@@ ast .
G@@ ood day to you after which they low@@ ered their j@@ ugs into the water .
What c@@ ant you do ? asked F@@ ro@@ g .
I c@@ ant take a pur@@ se full of money up to heav@@ en , th@@ ats what .
When the Su@@ n Chief found the pur@@ se shor@@ tly af@@ ter@@ wards , he m@@ ut@@ tered .
Yes , but I can , said F@@ ro@@ g .
The Su@@ n Chief then went to speak to his w@@ ife , Mo@@ on L@@ ad@@ y .
This st@@ ory comes from Ang@@ ola .
I c@@ ant do that ! he conf@@ essed a mom@@ ent later .
O@@ h , said K@@ im@@ ana qu@@ ite taken ab@@ ack by R@@ ab@@ b@@ its re@@ action .
So , early the next morning F@@ ro@@ g put K@@ im@@ an@@ as letter in his m@@ outh and h@@ id in the well .
C@@ ant do what ? asked F@@ ro@@ g .
Sh@@ all I lead you to your h@@ us@@ b@@ and-@@ to-@@ be ? he asked .
G@@ ood day to you .
Her@@ es a pur@@ se full of money .
E@@ ach morning these young women would clim@@ b down from the sk@@ y on a l@@ add@@ er made by sp@@ id@@ er and fill up their water j@@ ugs before retur@@ ning to heav@@ en again .
Th@@ ats a difficul@@ t name to rem@@ ember , he said .
Well , said An@@ ans@@ e with a sm@@ ile , when the dr@@ um@@ m@@ ers be@@ at the small dr@@ um it will make a sound like F@@ ir@@ i b@@ omo !
Af@@ ter@@ wards An@@ ans@@ e re@@ alised how fo@@ ol@@ ish he had been .
I@@ ts called P@@ ona , said N@@ ight .
When An@@ ans@@ e go@@ t to N@@ ights v@@ ill@@ age he said to N@@ ight , Your f@@ ather wan@@ ts to see you .
Th@@ en it se@@ em@@ ed a th@@ ought struc@@ k him .
And you , Mo@@ on , he said tur@@ ning to his second son , you have also for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the things I told you .
I have completed my task , mas@@ ter , said An@@ ans@@ e b@@ ow@@ ing low to the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
W@@ as Su@@ n a wise cho@@ ice , he w@@ ond@@ ered ?
H@@ ow do I cho@@ ose ? the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od m@@ ut@@ tered .
H@@ ow will that help ? asked Su@@ n , conf@@ used .
I@@ ts called As@@ ant@@ e , f@@ ather , answ@@ ered Mo@@ on .
Th@@ ank you , said An@@ ans@@ e , im@@ pres@@ sed .
This was because Su@@ n was the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods fav@@ our@@ ite son , but just because he was his fav@@ our@@ ite did this also me@@ an he should be ch@@ ief ?
An@@ ans@@ e gave the matter a lot of th@@ ought and in the end decided to dis@@ gu@@ ise h@@ im@@ self as a bir@@ d and do a b@@ it of sp@@ ying before carr@@ ying out his mas@@ ters instruc@@ tion .
Wh@@ ile they were growing up N@@ ight , Mo@@ on and Su@@ n l@@ ived with their f@@ ather , but when it came time for him to sel@@ ect one of them as ch@@ ief he sent them to live in their own v@@ ill@@ ages so that he could make his decision without too many distr@@ actions .
Now I must go and deliv@@ er the same mess@@ age to your two bro@@ th@@ ers , said An@@ ans@@ e .
At this rem@@ ark Su@@ n pul@@ led a face .
Wh@@ o do I cho@@ ose ?
An@@ ans@@ e reas@@ oned that there was only one way out of the pre@@ dic@@ am@@ ent he had created for h@@ im@@ self : in order to keep h@@ im@@ self in the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods good book@@ s he needed to conv@@ in@@ ce his mas@@ ter that he ac@@ tually could t@@ ell what he was th@@ ink@@ ing .
The capital of G@@ h@@ ana is Ac@@ cr@@ a .
Th@@ ats a good plan , he said .
A y@@ am , by the way , look@@ s rather like a pot@@ a@@ to .
H@@ O@@ W S@@ P@@ ID@@ E@@ R R@@ E@@ A@@ D T@@ H@@ E S@@ K@@ Y@@ -@@ G@@ O@@ D@@ S T@@ H@@ O@@ U@@ G@@ H@@ T@@ S
D@@ o you know what the question is ? asked Su@@ n .
I know what y@@ our@@ e th@@ ink@@ ing . D@@ o you ? said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , but inst@@ e@@ ad of carr@@ ying on the conv@@ ers@@ ation as sp@@ id@@ er had expected him to do , he changed the subject .
At S@@ un@@ s v@@ ill@@ age , An@@ ans@@ e said , Your f@@ ather says you must come along with me . Th@@ en I@@ ll set out str@@ a@@ ight away , but first let me get you som@@ eth@@ ing to e@@ at .
For this reason , I have decided that only children will play during your re@@ ign .
Su@@ n then went and s@@ la@@ ugh@@ tered a she@@ ep , which he ro@@ as@@ ted in hon@@ our of his small gu@@ est .
Yes , I do : he will ask you to name his fav@@ our@@ ite y@@ am , which is called K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi .
Th@@ en tur@@ ning back to his s@@ ons once more , Su@@ n , if Mo@@ on tries to tr@@ es@@ p@@ ass upon your time K@@ ont@@ on@@ ku@@ row@@ ie , which is the cir@@ cul@@ ar r@@ ain@@ bo@@ w , will th@@ ro@@ w itself around you and this will keep Mo@@ on away .
Now , throughout this cer@@ em@@ ony the dr@@ ums were be@@ ating . There were small dr@@ ums and In@@ p@@ int@@ ini dr@@ ums and the sound they made was K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi b@@ omo !
After the me@@ al An@@ ans@@ e said , L@@ ets go and si@@ t on that f@@ all@@ en t@@ ree over there , I have som@@ eth@@ ing to t@@ ell you .
The S@@ k@@ y G@@ od had three s@@ ons N@@ ight , Mo@@ on , and Su@@ n .
When the loc@@ als saw this str@@ ange new bir@@ d they all became exc@@ ited .
Th@@ en , ed@@ g@@ ing clos@@ er , An@@ ans@@ e beg@@ an to wh@@ is@@ per .
Your three s@@ ons are here as you ord@@ ered .
But this was eas@@ ier said than done .
And when they were se@@ ated together , Your f@@ ather has prepar@@ ed a th@@ r@@ one for the son he will name as ch@@ ief and he wan@@ ts you to be that person .
N@@ ight , he said , you are my el@@ d@@ est son . What is the name of this y@@ am ?
Su@@ n , you l@@ ist@@ ened to my words and you did not for@@ get them ;
However , he will also ask you and your two bro@@ th@@ ers the same question , and the one who answ@@ ers the question correc@@ tly will be nam@@ ed as ch@@ ief .
N@@ ight , he said , addres@@ sing h@@ im@@ self to his el@@ d@@ est son , I also took you on wal@@ ks , but you have allowed y@@ our@@ self to for@@ get the things I told you , including the name of this y@@ am .
you l@@ ist@@ ened to my adv@@ ice , so you are to be the ch@@ ief .
But there is one question that I need each one of you to answ@@ er before I make my final decision .
Yes , I know it is , but I can help you with that .
Su@@ n nod@@ d@@ ed .
The fact was he d@@ id@@ n@@ t know what the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od had been th@@ ink@@ ing and had m@@ er@@ ely sp@@ ok@@ en out in the hope of attr@@ acting his mas@@ ters attention .
O@@ h , and one more thing , he said sm@@ il@@ ing down at sp@@ id@@ er , In the past my dec@@ re@@ es were called The s@@ ay@@ ings of the S@@ k@@ y-@@ G@@ od , but now , since An@@ ans@@ e , the sp@@ id@@ er , has been able to read my min@@ d , they should be called The S@@ ay@@ ings of Sp@@ id@@ er .
During this period , he rem@@ ained in his p@@ al@@ ace where he would si@@ t de@@ ep in th@@ ought on his th@@ r@@ one , a fire@@ -@@ bl@@ ack@@ ened st@@ ool , tr@@ ying to arr@@ ive at a ver@@ d@@ ict .
I know , he said , s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly sm@@ il@@ ing to h@@ im@@ self , I will pul@@ l up a y@@ am known as K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi , which I used to show to my s@@ ons when they were young .
This was a difficul@@ t question for the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od to answ@@ er and one which he th@@ ought about all the time .
Th@@ ank you , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , then ra@@ ising his vo@@ ice so every@@ one could he@@ ar , M@@ y s@@ ons , the reason I have b@@ roug@@ ht you here is because I now wish to cho@@ ose a ch@@ ief .
It is called K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi .
L@@ ook , this is what I@@ m going to do .
I@@ ll make a small dr@@ um for you , and I@@ ll also make an In@@ p@@ int@@ ini dr@@ um to go with it .
The following st@@ ory comes from G@@ h@@ ana , which is a w@@ est@@ -@@ African country situated between I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast and T@@ og@@ o .
And if r@@ ain cl@@ ou@@ ds g@@ ather , I shall sh@@ oo@@ t an ar@@ ro@@ w into the sk@@ y to drive them away .
B@@ ec@@ ause of this , it is now law that only w@@ ic@@ ked things will be done during your time of day .
What kind of bir@@ d is that ? the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od asked those around him , but no one k@@ new .
T@@ ur@@ ning to his second son , the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od said , What do you think is the name of this y@@ am , Mo@@ on ?
An@@ ans@@ e ed@@ ged clos@@ er so that he could he@@ ar what he was s@@ aying .
He was just about to f@@ ly away again when he re@@ alised that the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od was still tal@@ king to h@@ im@@ self .
Su@@ n st@@ ep@@ ped forward and took the y@@ am from his f@@ ath@@ ers hand .
Now you@@ ve read the st@@ ory , do you think this was a good way for the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od to cho@@ ose a new ch@@ ief ? And what about Su@@ n was he fair to his two bro@@ th@@ ers ?
Some of those present look@@ ed conf@@ used and the rest just sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ ably , but no one spo@@ ke .
An@@ ans@@ e had over@@ heard all of this so now he re@@ ally did know what the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od was th@@ ink@@ ing : he wanted to name his fav@@ our@@ ite son , Su@@ n , as ch@@ ief , but only if Su@@ n could rem@@ ember the name of the special y@@ am he had been sh@@ own as a child .
You used to take me for wal@@ ks when I was very small and you used to t@@ ell me its name , and I have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten it .
At this re@@ ply those present sh@@ ou@@ ted and appl@@ aud@@ ed .
If An@@ ans@@ e were here , he would know the bir@@ ds name , he said l@@ ou@@ dly . Th@@ en he sig@@ h@@ ed and said much more qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly to h@@ im@@ self , He would also know that I want to make Su@@ n ch@@ ief , but I c@@ ant make up my min@@ d if this is the right decision .
I rem@@ ember this , he said .
I would have lik@@ ed my f@@ ather to be here so that I could pre@@ p@@ are a me@@ al for him also , Su@@ n conf@@ essed , and I@@ m sor@@ ry that he is@@ n@@ t , but y@@ our@@ e here as his representative so I shall show you all the hon@@ our and respect I would have sh@@ own him .
H@@ ow Sp@@ id@@ er Re@@ ad the S@@ k@@ y-@@ G@@ ods Th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts
And when they be@@ at the l@@ n@@ p@@ int@@ ini dr@@ um at the same time it will sound like this .
K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi b@@ omo ! , which is the word you have to rem@@ ember , right ? and sp@@ id@@ er made the sound of the dr@@ um with his m@@ outh , K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi b@@ omo !
What he needed was a plan .
He has asked me to bring you to him .
At Mo@@ ons v@@ ill@@ age the same thing happ@@ ened : An@@ ans@@ e deliv@@ ered the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods mess@@ age and Mo@@ on th@@ ank@@ ed him by g@@ iving him some m@@ ash@@ ed y@@ am to e@@ at .
Th@@ ank you for deliv@@ ering the mess@@ age , said N@@ ight .
A day later Su@@ n , Mo@@ on and N@@ ight gath@@ ered in their f@@ ath@@ ers v@@ ill@@ age .
Th@@ en at least let me give you som@@ eth@@ ing to e@@ at for your jour@@ ney , said N@@ ight and b@@ roug@@ ht out some ro@@ as@@ ted cor@@ n which he gave to An@@ ans@@ e .
If one of them is able to rem@@ ember its name then that son shall become ch@@ ief .
An@@ ans@@ e , he said , please go and bring my three s@@ ons to me .
Some of them started sh@@ ou@@ ting and point@@ ing and every@@ one made such a comm@@ o@@ tion they soon attr@@ acted the attention of the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od h@@ im@@ self .
A@@ h ! th@@ ought An@@ ans@@ e , so that was what my mas@@ ter was th@@ ink@@ ing !
Sh@@ ould any one have a matter to set@@ tle , let it be heard in S@@ un@@ s time .
Th@@ en the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od ro@@ se to his fe@@ et and every@@ one f@@ ell sil@@ ent .
Th@@ en , just as the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od was about to tur@@ n away again , An@@ ans@@ e the sp@@ id@@ er said , I do , mas@@ ter .
K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi b@@ omo ! just as sp@@ id@@ er said they would .
Th@@ en , happ@@ ily , he tur@@ ned to his you@@ ng@@ est son .
Th@@ ats why , one day , he s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly look@@ ed around at his att@@ end@@ ants and asked , C@@ an anyone t@@ ell me what I am th@@ ink@@ ing ?
It grow@@ s under the ground too , but only in t@@ rop@@ ical countries .
At this point he held up a K@@ int@@ ink@@ yi y@@ am that he had du@@ g up that morning .
He was also wor@@ r@@ ied that his sub@@ jects would re@@ alise that he was@@ n@@ t g@@ iving his full attention to the aff@@ airs of state .
So , he took some f@@ lower p@@ et@@ als that res@@ emb@@ led bir@@ d fe@@ ath@@ ers and st@@ uc@@ k them onto his body . Th@@ en , with his bir@@ d cos@@ t@@ ume in place , he f@@ le@@ w to the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods v@@ ill@@ age , where he per@@ ched h@@ im@@ self in the br@@ an@@ ches of a t@@ ree in the centre of the main s@@ qu@@ are .
In other words , in spe@@ aking out , he had du@@ g a very large h@@ ole for h@@ im@@ self and now there was a very good ch@@ ance he was about to f@@ all in !
W@@ ill you do that ?
Th@@ en se@@ e@@ ing the look of conf@@ us@@ ion on the others face , You know what this is , don@@ t you ?
Yes .
Yes , my l@@ ord , it w@@ oke me up with its l@@ ou@@ d call@@ s .
Th@@ en he led the su@@ n inside his p@@ al@@ ace .
And so every morning when the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el crow@@ s the su@@ n know@@ s that it is time to w@@ ake up and h@@ ur@@ ry to the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods home in the sk@@ y .
O@@ h , and by the way , added the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , come back to see me in the morning .
Yes , I will , my l@@ ord .
I have a present for you , he said , hol@@ ding it out to the su@@ n .
H@@ ere take it , the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od said , th@@ r@@ us@@ ting the large white bir@@ d in the s@@ un@@ s g@@ ol@@ den arms .
Th@@ en after you have visited my house you can s@@ low@@ ly go back to your own .
You can go now .
I@@ ts my pl@@ eas@@ ure to be here , si@@ r , said the su@@ n very gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ously .
Well .@@ thank you , my l@@ ord , said the su@@ n h@@ esit@@ antly because he was still rather p@@ uz@@ z@@ led .
I hope your jour@@ ney was@@ n@@ t too ti@@ ring because I know it was very difficul@@ t .
According to most sci@@ ent@@ ists our univ@@ erse beg@@ an with a bi@@ g ban@@ g about 10 billion years ago .
However , it took the su@@ n a long time to ste@@ er a pat@@ h through all the st@@ ars because they had not yet been given their posi@@ tions in the sk@@ y , which me@@ ant that f@@ inding a way am@@ ong@@ st them was qu@@ ite difficul@@ t .
Yes , my l@@ ord , of course I will , he answ@@ ered .
In fact I want you to do that every morning .
After the su@@ n had de@@ par@@ ted for his place in the sk@@ y , the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od then called the mo@@ on to his house .
However , in this st@@ ory from Ang@@ ola a different expl@@ an@@ ation about how the world beg@@ an is sugg@@ ested .
And so the su@@ n wal@@ ked away carr@@ ying a large coc@@ k@@ er@@ el under his arm .
Yes , my l@@ ord , of course I do , its a coc@@ k@@ er@@ el .
I heard your coc@@ k@@ er@@ el c@@ ro@@ w , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
H@@ ow the World B@@ eg@@ an
E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually , however , the su@@ n arr@@ ived at the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods house .
Th@@ ank you for doing that .
This was@@ n@@ t what the su@@ n had expected , but the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od was his l@@ ord and mas@@ ter , so what cho@@ ice did he have ?
O@@ f course , the su@@ n was very ti@@ red after his long jour@@ ney across the heav@@ ens and he was also very h@@ ung@@ ry .
G@@ ood morning , my l@@ ord , the su@@ n said respec@@ t@@ fully , I am here as you asked .
I@@ m pl@@ eased to he@@ ar that , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od then he re@@ ached behind him and pul@@ led out a live coc@@ k@@ er@@ el .
In fact , he th@@ ought of e@@ ating the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el but then decided against the ide@@ a .
E@@ arly the next morning the su@@ n was w@@ ok@@ en up by the l@@ ou@@ d coc@@ k@@ -@@ a-@@ d@@ oo@@ dl@@ e-@@ do of the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el and he h@@ ur@@ r@@ ied off to see the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
G@@ ood .
In the end , the su@@ n was so ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted he just l@@ ay down on the so@@ ft gr@@ ass outside the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods house and was soon f@@ ast as@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ O@@ W T@@ H@@ E W@@ O@@ R@@ L@@ D B@@ E@@ G@@ A@@ N
It was while this was happ@@ ening that all the st@@ ars and plan@@ ets were formed .
W@@ el@@ come to my house , he said sitting down on his th@@ r@@ one .
After all , the bir@@ d had been to given him by the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , so e@@ ating it just d@@ id@@ n@@ t se@@ em like the right thing to do .
Yes , thank you for coming , re@@ pl@@ ied the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
After he had th@@ ought about this problem for a long time he asked the su@@ n to come and visit him .
F@@ rom now on you must let the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el w@@ ake you up in the morning then you must come str@@ a@@ ight to my house here in the sk@@ y .
When the great S@@ k@@ y G@@ od decided to create the world he also had to decide where in the heav@@ ens to put the su@@ n and mo@@ on .
Th@@ en I r@@ ush@@ ed here to see you as you asked .
A long , long time ago , mil@@ li@@ ons of years before the E@@ ar@@ th ex@@ isted , the sk@@ y look@@ ed very different to what it does today .
I see you decided not to e@@ at the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el that I gave you , even though you were ti@@ red and h@@ ung@@ ry , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
O@@ f course not , my l@@ ord .
G@@ ood ev@@ ening , mo@@ on , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , then get@@ ting str@@ a@@ ight down to business , here is a coc@@ k@@ er@@ el for you .
Th@@ ank you , my l@@ ord , said the mo@@ on b@@ ow@@ ing very de@@ e@@ ply .
Th@@ ank you , my l@@ ord .
Yes , my l@@ ord .
The bir@@ d was a g@@ ift from you .
Please come and see me t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w morning .
The mo@@ on was rather sur@@ pr@@ ised by the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods be@@ havi@@ our and even more sur@@ pr@@ ised when she was given a live coc@@ k@@ er@@ el to hold .
Th@@ en , carr@@ ying the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el under her arm , she went off to find a place to s@@ le@@ ep .
At this rem@@ ark the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od look@@ ed very pl@@ eased .
But I will ask you to come to see me every tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ eight days and while y@@ our@@ e away , I@@ ll keep my e@@ ye on you in the sk@@ y .
L@@ ike the su@@ n , the mo@@ on also had a long wal@@ k among the st@@ ars to re@@ ach the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods house .
I would never e@@ at it .
E@@ arly the next morning the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el w@@ oke the mo@@ on with its l@@ ou@@ d crow@@ ing and the mo@@ on went to see the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od again .
S@@ til@@ l , she reas@@ oned , the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od had made the univ@@ erse , so he must know what he was doing .
In fact , the jour@@ ney took so long it was night time when mo@@ on fin@@ ally kno@@ c@@ ked on the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods do@@ or .
And with these words the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od b@@ id the mo@@ on go@@ od@@ b@@ ye and sent her back to her al@@ lo@@ t@@ ted place in the sk@@ y .
Sin@@ ce that time the su@@ n and the mo@@ on have ob@@ ey@@ ed the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods w@@ ishes .
It was a long jour@@ ney .
Well , here is a coc@@ k@@ er@@ el , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
After the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od had placed the su@@ n and the mo@@ on in their posi@@ tions in the sk@@ y he then tur@@ ned his attention to another important matter : cre@@ ating M@@ an . For many , many years after man was created he l@@ ived qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly in Afric@@ as for@@ ests then one day he also decided to visit the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od in his p@@ al@@ ace .
A@@ ny@@ way , M@@ an ev@@ ent@@ ually arr@@ ived at the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods house and kno@@ c@@ ked on the front do@@ or .
E@@ very morning , the su@@ n wak@@ es up when the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el crow@@ s then immediately go@@ es to visit the sk@@ y G@@ od at his house .
O@@ h , I am , my l@@ ord , re@@ pl@@ ied M@@ an , very ti@@ red .
A@@ h , M@@ an . Y@@ ou@@ ve fin@@ ally go@@ t here , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
And every tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ eight days , when the mo@@ on is full , she does the same thing .
In fact , he would never have go@@ t there without some mag@@ ical help from the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od h@@ im@@ self , but th@@ ats another st@@ ory .
You must be ti@@ red .
As you can im@@ ag@@ ine , it took M@@ an a long time to get to the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods house .
He l@@ it a fire , co@@ ok@@ ed the bir@@ d over the open fl@@ ames then s@@ at down to en@@ jo@@ y his sup@@ per .
Yes , I@@ m a@@ fr@@ aid it is .
Please take it with you and come and see me again t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w morning .
But he was so wor@@ n out he only managed to e@@ at half the bir@@ d before he f@@ ell into a de@@ ep s@@ le@@ ep .
Th@@ ank you , my l@@ ord , said M@@ an gr@@ at@@ eful@@ ly accep@@ ting the bir@@ d .
Th@@ ats very kind of you , my l@@ ord .
The M@@ an was ti@@ red and h@@ ung@@ ry just like the su@@ n and the mo@@ on had been , but un@@ like them he decided to e@@ at the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el .
You ob@@ vi@@ ously s@@ le@@ p@@ t through the coc@@ k c@@ ro@@ w this morning .
That was when M@@ an s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly re@@ alised that he had done som@@ eth@@ ing wr@@ ong .
I was so h@@ ung@@ ry last night I k@@ illed and ate the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el you gave me .
O@@ h , I@@ d better r@@ us@@ h off and see the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od , M@@ an said , le@@ ap@@ ing to his fe@@ et and r@@ ubb@@ ing the s@@ le@@ ep from his ey@@ es .
Is it that l@@ ate already , my l@@ ord ? asked M@@ an .
I@@ ts a g@@ ift from me .
The S@@ k@@ y G@@ od m@@ et him at the do@@ or to his p@@ al@@ ace .
G@@ ood morning , or should I say good af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ? he j@@ ok@@ ed .
After a long p@@ ause he said n@@ erv@@ ously , I have som@@ eth@@ ing I must t@@ ell you , my l@@ ord .
In fact , he was so ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted he s@@ le@@ p@@ t for a long , long time and only w@@ oke up when the su@@ n was already high in the sk@@ y .
No , you will di@@ e like the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el did .
I gave the su@@ n and the mo@@ on a coc@@ k@@ er@@ el each , but they d@@ id@@ n@@ t e@@ at their bir@@ ds even though they were just as h@@ ung@@ ry as you .
B@@ y now the M@@ an was so sc@@ ar@@ ed his m@@ outh had g@@ one dr@@ y .
Now leave me and go away , said the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od .
Wh@@ y did you do that ?
B@@ ec@@ ause you k@@ illed and ate the coc@@ k@@ er@@ el I gave you , you will not live for@@ ever in the sk@@ y like the su@@ n and the mo@@ on .
And so it came to p@@ ass that all of the hum@@ ans who were b@@ orn after that first man , had to live out their lives on E@@ ar@@ th and only visited the S@@ k@@ y G@@ od in his house after they d@@ ied .
I d@@ id@@ n@@ t know I was doing any@@ thing wr@@ ong , my l@@ ord , he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed f@@ ear@@ fully .
With his min@@ d still m@@ ix@@ ed up , the M@@ an beg@@ an his long jour@@ ney back down to
The S@@ k@@ y G@@ od g@@ lar@@ ed at him .
The M@@ an d@@ id@@ n@@ t know what to think because he was@@ n@@ t sure if the S@@ k@@ y G@@ ods r@@ ul@@ ing was a good or a b@@ ad thing for him .
You me@@ an to your house in the sk@@ y , my l@@ ord ?
This expl@@ ains why the mo@@ on and the su@@ n jour@@ ney across the sk@@ y in the way they do and why hum@@ ans remain on E@@ ar@@ th for their enti@@ re lives .

G@@ iven the arr@@ ay of authorities within the national , provincial and municipal s@@ pher@@ es of government who have the power to ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate property , there is a need to ensure unif@@ or@@ m@@ ity in the way org@@ ans of state under@@ take ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation .
In the subsequ@@ ent dr@@ af@@ ting of the Bill , the Department specif@@ ically li@@ a@@ ised with the Department of Land Affairs and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development .
? ? the market value of the property ;
and ? ? the purpose of the ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation ;
In N@@ ov@@ ember 200@@ 7 , the Department of Public Wor@@ ks published a D@@ r@@ aft Pol@@ ic@@ y on the Ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation Bill for public com@@ ment and in Febru@@ ary 200@@ 8 , the Department hos@@ ted work@@ sh@@ ops on the policy with org@@ ans of state and the private sector , respec@@ tively .
The State L@@ aw Ad@@ vis@@ ers and the Department of Public Wor@@ ks are of the op@@ in@@ ion that this Bill must be deal@@ t with in accordance with the procedure established by section of the Constitution since it cont@@ ains no provision to which the procedure set out in section 7@@ 4 or 7@@ 6 of the Constitution applies .
all affected parties to be no@@ tified of a cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ated ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation , to affor@@ d such parties an opportunity to ra@@ ise objec@@ tions and make represent@@ ations to the ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ating authority , before a decision to ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate is taken .
The Bill seek@@ s to al@@ ign the Act with the Constitution and to provide a common framework to gu@@ ide the processes and procedures for ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation of property by org@@ ans of state , by providing for the extension of the purposes for which property may be ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ated from the n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w term of public purpose to include ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ations in the public interest .
? ? the extent of direct state investment and subsid@@ y in the ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion and benef@@ icial capital improv@@ ement of the property ;
Wh@@ il@@ st the market value of ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ated property is a pre@@ dom@@ in@@ ant fac@@ tor in the Act , the Constitution does not give und@@ ue we@@ ight to any single fac@@ tor over others , but requires consideration of all relevant fac@@ tors , including ? ? the current use of the property ;

? ? the history of the ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion and use of the property ;
The re@@ dr@@ af@@ ting of the Act therefore became necessary to ensure consist@@ ency with the spirit and provisions of the Constitution dealing especially with equ@@ ality , property rights , access to information , and law@@ ful , reasonable and proced@@ ur@@ ally fair administrative dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making .
The implementation of the Bill will have financial im@@ plic@@ ations for the Department of Public Wor@@ ks , in that it will be responsible for the establishment of the Ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation Ad@@ vis@@ ory Bo@@ ards and their sec@@ ret@@ ari@@ ats , as well as a register of ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ations .

So with his new plan all work@@ ed out , man@@ ti@@ s took his d@@ j@@ ani up into the t@@ all@@ est ba@@ ob@@ a@@ b and wa@@ ited qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly am@@ ong@@ st the br@@ an@@ ches .
On the day that the man@@ ti@@ s decided to put his plan into action he h@@ id h@@ im@@ self in a bus@@ h until the sk@@ y beg@@ an to d@@ ar@@ k@@ en .
He must be a go@@ d so we must bo@@ w down and pr@@ a@@ ise him .
T@@ H@@ E M@@ AN@@ T@@ IS AN@@ D T@@ H@@ E M@@ O@@ O@@ N
And while it was tr@@ ying to free itself the man@@ ti@@ s would s@@ cr@@ amb@@ le up the st@@ ake and clim@@ b onto the mo@@ on , which he would then r@@ ide vic@@ tor@@ i@@ ously across the sk@@ y .
Now I@@ ve ca@@ ug@@ ht you !
In the days that followed this first attemp@@ t , the man@@ ti@@ s went back to observ@@ ing the mo@@ on .
I@@ ll have one more try , he said , then clos@@ ed his ey@@ es for a mom@@ ent , prepar@@ ing for an even gre@@ ater le@@ ap .
Ang@@ r@@ ily pic@@ king up a st@@ one he h@@ ur@@ led it into the po@@ ol .
No , not that .
Pl@@ an N@@ umb@@ er Three was to c@@ ut a st@@ ake , shar@@ p@@ en it at one end and set it into the ground on a h@@ ill@@ top .
I@@ m coming to get you , mo@@ on , said the man@@ ti@@ s , and with a wh@@ ir@@ ring of w@@ ings , he left the c@@ am@@ el th@@ orn t@@ ree and f@@ le@@ w to the f@@ oo@@ t of the ba@@ ob@@ a@@ b t@@ ree .
That night he h@@ id in a bus@@ h from where he wat@@ ched the mo@@ on m@@ ove s@@ low@@ ly towards the st@@ ake .
A div@@ in@@ er was a hol@@ y person who could for@@ et@@ ell the future .
The word man@@ ti@@ s comes from an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ek and means div@@ in@@ er .
What would happ@@ en , he w@@ ond@@ ered , if one night the mo@@ on v@@ an@@ ished and never ro@@ se again ?
But then a sur@@ pr@@ ise aw@@ a@@ ited him : when he re@@ ached the top of the t@@ ree the mo@@ on se@@ em@@ ed as far away as ever .
When the r@@ ising mo@@ on was directly above his h@@ id@@ ing place he fl@@ ung the d@@ j@@ ani into the sk@@ y with all his might .
He go@@ t to the base of the c@@ am@@ el th@@ orn t@@ ree then beg@@ an to clim@@ b up the tr@@ un@@ k as f@@ ast as he could .
And , of course , they are also rem@@ emb@@ ering the small shor@@ t-@@ w@@ ing@@ ed one who w@@ ished to be a go@@ d .
That was when ev@@ en@@ ings sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ s beg@@ an to cre@@ ep out from under the st@@ ones where they had been h@@ id@@ ing during the h@@ ot@@ test part of the day .
The S@@ an reg@@ arded the man@@ ti@@ s as a special cre@@ ature with mag@@ ical powers .
that he d@@ id@@ n@@ t want to r@@ ide upon the mo@@ on either .
All that happ@@ ened was that the st@@ ake cast a long , th@@ in sh@@ ad@@ ow on the ground while the mo@@ on mov@@ ed across the sk@@ y , high above .
That plan d@@ id@@ n@@ t work qu@@ ite as well as I th@@ ought it would , said the man@@ ti@@ s , look@@ ing rather up@@ set .
There were even n@@ ights when there was no mo@@ on at all .
That was when he re@@ alised how fo@@ ol@@ ish he had been ;
F@@ ir@@ st he w@@ ove a rop@@ e out of dr@@ y gr@@ ass then he made a no@@ ose out of the rop@@ e which he ti@@ ed to the end of a long sti@@ c@@ k .
As the mo@@ on ro@@ se into the sk@@ y it would p@@ i@@ er@@ ce itself on the sti@@ c@@ k and get st@@ uc@@ k there .
V@@ ery car@@ eful@@ ly the man@@ ti@@ s cre@@ p@@ t for@@ wards until he was look@@ ing down at the mo@@ ons br@@ ight dis@@ c flo@@ ating below him in the po@@ ol .
O@@ h , you fo@@ ol@@ ish mo@@ on ! the man@@ ti@@ s sm@@ il@@ ed .
The man@@ ti@@ s had no@@ tic@@ ed that the mo@@ on went through different ph@@ as@@ es as it ro@@ se into the sk@@ y , so he reas@@ oned the best thing that he could do was to cap@@ ture it early on , when it first pe@@ ered over the hor@@ iz@@ on .
H@@ ed st@@ op@@ ped because the mo@@ on was there too , and it was ca@@ ug@@ ht in the water .
E@@ v@@ en the high@@ fl@@ ying night bir@@ ds co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t re@@ ach it , so how could a small aw@@ kw@@ ard cre@@ ature with short , wh@@ ir@@ ring w@@ ings hope to get there ?
The d@@ j@@ ani consists of a leng@@ th of re@@ ed , a par@@ tr@@ idge fe@@ ather and a st@@ one all ti@@ ed together with a short tw@@ ist of sin@@ ew .
But by the time he fin@@ ally re@@ ached the top of the t@@ ree the mo@@ on had mov@@ ed on again .
F@@ ir@@ st he no@@ tic@@ ed the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ s of the th@@ orn tre@@ es on the s@@ and , then he saw the bir@@ ds d@@ ar@@ ting clear and sw@@ ift across the sk@@ y .
Th@@ ank you , mo@@ on , he said sin@@ cer@@ ely , b@@ ow@@ ing de@@ e@@ ply to the sk@@ y .
He managed to get back to the bank where he st@@ ood sh@@ iv@@ ering , we@@ t and conf@@ used .
Once upon a time there was a man@@ ti@@ s whose gre@@ at@@ est wish was to si@@ t on the mo@@ on as it s@@ ailed c@@ ross the sk@@ y each night .
Wh@@ y had he st@@ op@@ ped , you may ask ?
M@@ y ey@@ es ! he scre@@ am@@ ed .
He no@@ tic@@ ed that it k@@ ept chang@@ ing , for example . Th@@ en it go@@ t b@@ igg@@ er again . It ro@@ se later each night and it go@@ t sm@@ all@@ er and sm@@ all@@ er every time he saw it .
I need to out@@ w@@ it the mo@@ on , he k@@ ept t@@ elling h@@ im@@ self , which is why he came up with Pl@@ an N@@ umb@@ er F@@ our .
H@@ ow would all the night cre@@ atures in the des@@ ert sur@@ vi@@ ve without the mo@@ ons g@@ low to help them find food ?
O@@ f@@ ten the man@@ ti@@ s would dre@@ am about how pro@@ ud he would fe@@ el g@@ az@@ ing down onto the great dr@@ y K@@ al@@ ah@@ ari Des@@ ert where he l@@ ived , how his hear@@ t would s@@ well as he star@@ ed out across the emp@@ ty wat@@ er@@ cour@@ ses and the her@@ ds of spr@@ ing@@ bo@@ k gr@@ az@@ ing am@@ ong@@ st the c@@ am@@ el th@@ orn tre@@ es .
Th@@ en the mo@@ on beg@@ an to r@@ ise .
That was how he came to be standing next to a wat@@ er@@ h@@ ole in the des@@ ert an h@@ our later .
L@@ ater on , when it ro@@ se high@@ er into the sk@@ y it mov@@ ed f@@ aster and f@@ aster and often , just as d@@ aw@@ n was arr@@ iving , it would sw@@ if@@ tly v@@ anis@@ h into the heav@@ ens even before it re@@ ached the hor@@ iz@@ on .
N@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , with his arms out@@ st@@ ret@@ ched he le@@ ap@@ t up into the air only to f@@ all back into the br@@ an@@ ches , where he s@@ at dis@@ appointed wat@@ ching the mo@@ on flo@@ at away across the sk@@ y and f@@ ade into the d@@ aw@@ n .
The events you are going to read about happ@@ ened a long time ago when great her@@ ds of el@@ eph@@ ant and g@@ em@@ s@@ bo@@ k ro@@ am@@ ed across the v@@ ast , dr@@ y pl@@ ains of He@@ i@@ ku@@ m , which is the name the S@@ an people gave to the K@@ al@@ ah@@ ari Des@@ ert .
What I need now is a new approach , which is when he came up with the ide@@ a of tr@@ ying to tr@@ ap the mo@@ on .
B@@ ec@@ ause he was thir@@ st@@ y and needed a dr@@ ink ?
Sur@@ ely , th@@ ought the man@@ ti@@ s , if I th@@ ro@@ w the d@@ j@@ ani into the air it will tw@@ ist itself around the mo@@ on and then the we@@ ight of the st@@ one will bring the plan@@ et cr@@ ash@@ ing down to E@@ ar@@ th ?
It f@@ le@@ w out of his hand@@ s like a wh@@ i@@ p .
Exc@@ ept that things d@@ id@@ n@@ t qu@@ ite work out as he expected because when he thre@@ w his no@@ ose into the air , it sim@@ ply f@@ ell back emp@@ ty .
All he wanted was to get his sig@@ ht back and for the p@@ ain to go away .
It was only the next morning that the p@@ ain went away and the man@@ t@@ is@@ s ey@@ esig@@ ht retur@@ ned .
When a d@@ j@@ ani is t@@ os@@ sed into the air it spir@@ als back to the ground like a sy@@ c@@ am@@ or@@ e le@@ a@@ f .
U@@ p and up and up it went , then down and down and down it f@@ ell , back into the br@@ an@@ ches , the fe@@ ather fl@@ ut@@ tering am@@ ong@@ st the le@@ aves like a small , inj@@ ured bir@@ d .
All that night the man@@ ti@@ s st@@ ood pr@@ aying , s@@ way@@ ing g@@ ently , beg@@ g@@ ing the mo@@ on to give him back his sig@@ ht .
That is why now@@ ad@@ ays all man@@ t@@ ises si@@ t with their for@@ el@@ eg@@ s held up before their fac@@ es : they are pr@@ a@@ ising the mo@@ on that for@@ gave their anc@@ est@@ or and restor@@ ed his sig@@ ht .
I@@ ll not give up now , the man@@ ti@@ s said and beg@@ an to clim@@ b .
O@@ h , I@@ m so cl@@ ever .
It was now cr@@ adl@@ ed in the br@@ an@@ ches of a near@@ by ba@@ ob@@ a@@ b t@@ ree .
But when he look@@ ed again , the mo@@ on se@@ em@@ ed even further away .
Bl@@ ind@@ ed , he st@@ agg@@ ered away from the wat@@ er@@ h@@ ole and cr@@ ash@@ ed into some b@@ ush@@ es where he tr@@ ied to ru@@ b the s@@ pl@@ inter@@ s from his ey@@ es , but noth@@ ing would ease the p@@ ain .
O@@ f course , that d@@ id@@ n@@ t work either which is when his t@@ emp@@ er go@@ t the better of him again .
When the mo@@ on was above him he would ru@@ n out of his h@@ id@@ ing place , th@@ ro@@ w the no@@ ose around the mo@@ on and then ha@@ u@@ l h@@ im@@ self up .
What could be eas@@ ier than that ?
Com@@ e back , sh@@ ou@@ ted the man@@ ti@@ s , sh@@ aking a f@@ ist in the air , but his words just ec@@ ho@@ ed in the d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness .
This plan involved the use of a d@@ j@@ ani , which is a to@@ y that b@@ ush@@ man give to their children .
When the man@@ ti@@ s could see that the mo@@ on was ca@@ ug@@ ht in the br@@ an@@ ches of a near@@ by c@@ am@@ el th@@ orn t@@ ree , he cre@@ p@@ t out of his h@@ id@@ ing place and d@@ ar@@ ted across the ground .
This was when the mo@@ on was most vul@@ ner@@ able , when it was bi@@ g and c@@ umb@@ ers@@ ome and s@@ low@@ -@@ mov@@ ing .
T@@ ime and time again , the man@@ ti@@ s h@@ id in the br@@ an@@ ches of t@@ all tre@@ es wat@@ ching the mo@@ on as it s@@ ailed across the sk@@ y and time and time again he tr@@ ied to cat@@ ch it , but without success .
The next day the man@@ ti@@ s put his third plan into action .
But the man@@ ti@@ s was just an in@@ sec@@ t and the mo@@ on was far away .
He wanted to do this so that he could look down on all the other animals in the des@@ ert .
This time my plan is fo@@ ol@@ proof , said the man@@ ti@@ s , look@@ ing extr@@ em@@ ely pl@@ eased with h@@ im@@ self .
And in the end he came up with an answ@@ er .
Im@@ medi@@ ately the mo@@ ons refl@@ ection was sh@@ at@@ tered into a thous@@ and d@@ agg@@ er-@@ shar@@ p s@@ pl@@ inter@@ s .
H@@ is plan was that he would h@@ ide am@@ ong@@ st some roc@@ ks on a h@@ ill@@ top near@@ by .
Th@@ en he beg@@ an ch@@ as@@ ing after the mo@@ on .
But , of course , he had sp@@ ok@@ en too soon .
When he look@@ ed up he re@@ alised the t@@ ree was even t@@ all@@ er than he expected , so high in fact that its br@@ an@@ ches se@@ em@@ ed to be st@@ ret@@ ched out am@@ ong@@ st the st@@ ars .
M@@ y plan is@@ n@@ t working , said the man@@ ti@@ s after his tw@@ enti@@ et@@ h f@@ ailed attemp@@ t .
This was when the man@@ ti@@ s was the most un@@ eas@@ y .
The Man@@ ti@@ s and the Mo@@ on
No longer ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant and pro@@ ud , now he was just a small and h@@ umb@@ le in@@ sec@@ t .
I can still re@@ ach it , he said and thre@@ w h@@ im@@ self up into the air , only to f@@ all back into the br@@ an@@ ches .
This is the st@@ ory about how the man@@ ti@@ s became known as the pr@@ aying man@@ ti@@ s .
He im@@ ag@@ ined them look@@ ing up at him and s@@ aying , L@@ ook , there is the man@@ ti@@ s travell@@ ing on the mo@@ on .
This st@@ ory comes from the S@@ an people who live in the K@@ al@@ ah@@ ari Des@@ ert .
And by the time h@@ ed pic@@ ked it up for another th@@ ro@@ w , the mo@@ on had mov@@ ed on again .
For a long time the man@@ ti@@ s th@@ ought about this problem as he s@@ at roc@@ king back and for@@ th on a tw@@ i@@ g , or res@@ ting c@@ up@@ ped inside a le@@ a@@ f .
May@@ be I need to come up with another ide@@ a ?
F@@ ir@@ st he found the sti@@ c@@ k he needed then he shar@@ p@@ ened it at one end before he plan@@ ted it firm@@ ly in the ground .
I@@ ve go@@ t you now , he said , then , taking a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , he le@@ ap@@ t out into the water , only to sin@@ k g@@ as@@ ping and s@@ pl@@ ut@@ tering ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face .
May@@ be that was@@ n@@ t such a good ide@@ a , he said to h@@ im@@ self , re@@ aching for a tw@@ i@@ g which he then used to try and pro@@ d and pr@@ y the mo@@ on out of the water .
In a f@@ it of t@@ emp@@ er , the man@@ ti@@ s r@@ ip@@ ped the st@@ one from the d@@ j@@ ani and thre@@ w it on the ground .
H@@ aving f@@ ailed three times most people would give up , but not the man@@ ti@@ s who was a very determined fel@@ low .
that he d@@ id@@ n@@ t want to be a go@@ d any longer ;
At d@@ aw@@ n it appe@@ ars in the e@@ ast and at d@@ us@@ k in the w@@ est .
Be@@ fore long the old man lear@@ n@@ t that the b@@ oy@@ s name was K@@ il@@ ek@@ en and that he was an or@@ ph@@ an .
That night the old man st@@ ay@@ ed aw@@ ake , th@@ ink@@ ing about what to do .
When K@@ il@@ ek@@ en was a long way from the house he st@@ op@@ ped and beg@@ an look@@ ing around . He se@@ em@@ ed to be chec@@ king that no one was wat@@ ching him .
K@@ il@@ ek@@ en where are you ? he called out , but no one answ@@ ered , so he went to the wind@@ ow and look@@ ed out .
I@@ ve never seen my c@@ ow@@ s look so heal@@ thy .@@ And all the ch@@ or@@ es around the house are done , too .@@ I@@ ts just .@@ I@@ ts just amaz@@ ing .
In fact , I@@ d en@@ jo@@ y your company .
B@@ esid@@ es , not only was the bo@@ y a great help he was also good company too .
I don@@ t expec@@ t you to do all my j@@ obs , said the old man , but the bo@@ y just la@@ ugh@@ ed .
Th@@ ats too much .
B@@ y d@@ ay@@ bre@@ ak the next morning the bo@@ y had done all the things that he had prom@@ ised .
For this reason , he sp@@ ent most of his ev@@ en@@ ings g@@ az@@ ing up at the st@@ ars , many of which he k@@ new so well he th@@ ought of them as his children .
He d@@ id@@ n@@ t see the old man h@@ id@@ ing behind a bus@@ h .
For a while things continued as before and both the old man and the bo@@ y enj@@ oy@@ ed each others company and a life full of good things .
This st@@ ory comes from the Mas@@ a@@ ai , a nom@@ ad@@ ic people who live in K@@ enya .
B@@ y the time the su@@ n ro@@ se he had a plan all work@@ ed out .
S@@ adl@@ y , the old man wal@@ ked s@@ low@@ ly home across the cr@@ acked and bro@@ k@@ en ear@@ th .
Ac@@ tually , the old man was p@@ uz@@ z@@ led , though he d@@ id@@ n@@ t say so .
I don@@ t know .
But were fri@@ ends .
There was one st@@ ar in particular that the old man lik@@ ed more than all the others , but one night when he was out in the bus@@ h he look@@ ed up into the sk@@ y only to see that his fav@@ our@@ ite st@@ ar had g@@ one .
That ev@@ ening when he look@@ ed up at the night sk@@ y he saw the br@@ ight st@@ ar again that had g@@ one mis@@ sing on the night he had first m@@ et K@@ il@@ ek@@ en .
All he could think about was his young fri@@ ends sec@@ re@@ t powers ?
It is about the plan@@ et V@@ en@@ us , which the Ma@@ as@@ ai call K@@ il@@ ek@@ en .
No .
Yes , even you .
That was when he k@@ new that his young fri@@ end , K@@ il@@ ek@@ en the or@@ ph@@ an bo@@ y , had g@@ one back to the heav@@ ens .
It became fr@@ esh and gre@@ en and full of life with f@@ oun@@ t@@ ains of water and wo@@ od@@ ed gro@@ ves .
All that work you@@ ve des@@ cribed will take you two days at least .
Please trust me on this .
A mom@@ ent later the bo@@ y tur@@ ned into a bl@@ az@@ ing st@@ ar and sp@@ ed up@@ wards into the sk@@ y .
A@@ str@@ onom@@ ers now call that st@@ ar V@@ en@@ us .
Yes , you are , and thank you , said the old man , but that still do@@ es@@ n@@ t me@@ an to say you have to do all my work .
So where are you going to s@@ le@@ ep t@@ on@@ ight ? asked the old man .
In his sur@@ pr@@ ise , the old man let out a cr@@ y of sh@@ ock .
All the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful tre@@ es and b@@ ush@@ es that had spr@@ ung up so s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly now with@@ ered and d@@ ied .
Cr@@ ying out as if in p@@ ain he thre@@ w h@@ im@@ self to the ground , h@@ id@@ ing his head ben@@ e@@ ath his hand@@ s and mo@@ an@@ ing with des@@ p@@ air .
What special powers ?
I have lo@@ ts of energy in the morning .
But as time passed , so the old man@@ s cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity beg@@ an to gro@@ w until he became so ob@@ s@@ essed he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t s@@ le@@ ep at night .
In@@ st@@ antly a br@@ ight light beg@@ an to fill his body .
The next morning , the bo@@ y des@@ cribed the j@@ obs he was going to do that day .
He had ind@@ eed found out the b@@ oy@@ s sec@@ re@@ t but at what cost ?
At first the old man th@@ ought his young fri@@ end was j@@ ok@@ ing , then he re@@ alised that he was qu@@ ite serious .
The Ma@@ as@@ ai call it K@@ il@@ ek@@ en the or@@ ph@@ an who works long and hard all day .
O@@ h , don@@ t wor@@ ry , he said .
When it was going d@@ ark , the bo@@ y retur@@ ned to the old man@@ s house .
J@@ ust leave it to me , he said m@@ yst@@ er@@ i@@ ously .
Th@@ ats why I can do so much .
He look@@ ed up from his bed to see that his young gu@@ est had made break@@ f@@ ast and ti@@ d@@ ied up the house .
Once upon a time there was a very old man who l@@ ived al@@ one in a h@@ ut .
That was when the old man re@@ alised that through his actions the b@@ oy@@ s mag@@ ic powers had been taken away .
What could they be ? he k@@ ept as@@ king h@@ im@@ self , And why w@@ on@@ t he t@@ ell me about them ?
It started at the ti@@ ps of his out@@ st@@ ret@@ ched fing@@ ers and s@@ pread rap@@ idl@@ y down to his fe@@ et .
H@@ ell@@ o ?
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the bo@@ y tur@@ ned around and saw where he was h@@ id@@ ing .
E@@ v@@ en as the old man look@@ ed on , the land@@ s@@ cape changed from l@@ us@@ h , fer@@ ti@@ le and gre@@ en to dr@@ y , b@@ ar@@ ren and b@@ rown .
And I@@ m you@@ ng@@ er than you , too .
No fri@@ ends or rel@@ atives came to visit him and he only had his sh@@ ad@@ ow for company .
The bo@@ y sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged .
But K@@ il@@ ek@@ en just sm@@ il@@ ed .
I have special powers , said the bo@@ y .
When the old man w@@ oke up the next morning , he had a very pl@@ eas@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ ise .
Now he was l@@ on@@ el@@ ier than he had ever been .
No , you c@@ ant do all that in one day , said the old man , qu@@ ite sh@@ oc@@ ked .
In the dist@@ ance he could see the bo@@ y out in the fiel@@ ds , t@@ ending the c@@ att@@ le .
The Mor@@ ning St@@ ar
You should know that V@@ en@@ us sh@@ ines br@@ igh@@ tly in the morning and in the ev@@ ening .
S@@ at@@ is@@ fied that he was un@@ observ@@ ed , the bo@@ y cl@@ imb@@ ed onto a roc@@ k and lif@@ ted up his arms .
Your sec@@ re@@ t will be safe with me .
I@@ ts a sec@@ re@@ t .
On the way back to his house he m@@ et a bo@@ y who was also out wal@@ king and the two of them struc@@ k up a conv@@ ers@@ ation .
Th@@ ank you , th@@ ats very kind , said the bo@@ y and took him up on his offer .
Th@@ en when the bo@@ y left the h@@ ut he followed him at a dist@@ ance , making sure to keep out of sig@@ ht .
He search@@ ed the heav@@ ens for his child for a long time without success then , with a heav@@ y hear@@ t , he fin@@ ally he@@ aded back home .
And trust him he did , for a time at least .
I get them from my anc@@ est@@ ors .
Th@@ en s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly all the sur@@ ro@@ unding land beg@@ an to change .
But I off@@ ered you sh@@ el@@ ter .@@ I invited you into my house !
Special powers ? he repe@@ ated un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ly .
In some parts of the world V@@ en@@ us is called the morning st@@ ar , and in others it is called the ev@@ ening st@@ ar .
The old man th@@ ought about this .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually , these questions beg@@ an to g@@ na@@ w at him like a great h@@ ung@@ er until in the end he decided that he had to find some answ@@ ers .
Y@@ our@@ e welcome to st@@ ay with me , he said .
Th@@ en the land beg@@ an to change again , even before the old man could answ@@ er .
I beg@@ ged you not to do this , he said s@@ adl@@ y .
H@@ ow do you manage all this ? the old man asked .
T@@ H@@ E M@@ O@@ R@@ N@@ IN@@ G ST@@ A@@ R
In fact , not only that but when he b@@ roug@@ ht in the c@@ att@@ le they were f@@ at@@ ter and ro@@ under than the old man had ever seen them before .
Th@@ en he rem@@ emb@@ ered how l@@ on@@ ely he had been before the bo@@ y came to st@@ ay with him so he decided not to ask too many questions in case he off@@ ended his young gu@@ est .
Yes , I know , and for that I@@ m very gr@@ at@@ eful , but if I t@@ ell anyone my sec@@ re@@ t .
When K@@ il@@ ek@@ en go@@ t up and beg@@ an to pre@@ p@@ are for the day ah@@ e@@ ad the old man pre@@ t@@ ended to be as@@ le@@ ep .
I@@ m sor@@ ry , I c@@ ant t@@ ell you .
If I t@@ ell anyone my sec@@ re@@ t your good for@@ t@@ une will end .
A mom@@ ent later , all the col@@ our dr@@ ained from his face and his ey@@ es filled up with tear@@ s .
What he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t understand was how one small bo@@ y could manage to do so much ?
Yes , said the hum@@ ans .
Ar@@ e you qu@@ ite clear about the mess@@ age ?
I@@ m sor@@ ry , my l@@ ord , but I just said what I was told to say , answ@@ ered the h@@ are , sh@@ iv@@ ering with fe@@ ar .
N@@ ot long af@@ ter@@ wards the h@@ are went to see the mo@@ on to in@@ form him that the mess@@ age had been deliv@@ ered .
Wh@@ y ar@@ ent we re-@@ b@@ orn time and time again ?
E@@ very month the mo@@ on is b@@ orn as a s@@ li@@ m c@@ res@@ cent , grow@@ s to ful@@ l@@ ness then d@@ ies away , only to be re@@ b@@ orn a few days later .
Yes , I told the hum@@ ans that you di@@ e every month and that from now on the@@ y@@ re going to di@@ e , too , pro@@ bab@@ ly outside on the gr@@ ass .
The Or@@ ig@@ in of De@@ ath
Exc@@ ept that it was a long wal@@ k to where the hum@@ ans l@@ ived , and some@@ where along the way the h@@ are go@@ t conf@@ used and j@@ umb@@ led things up .
N@@ ot my problem , he said with a sh@@ ru@@ g and bo@@ und@@ ed off towards the for@@ est .
I have passed on your mess@@ age , my l@@ ord .
This st@@ ory comes from the Kh@@ o@@ is@@ an , a mainly nom@@ ad@@ ic people who l@@ ived in sou@@ thern Africa .
The fu@@ n in this g@@ ame comes from the fact that there is always a differ@@ ence between the original mess@@ age and the one which fin@@ ally emerg@@ es at the end of the ch@@ ain .
F@@ ir@@ st the h@@ are c@@ oug@@ h@@ ed to clear his th@@ ro@@ at then he said very l@@ ou@@ dly , E@@ very month I am b@@ orn , then I di@@ e sitting on the law@@ n .
F@@ rom now on this will happ@@ en to you .
The one you gave to the ant .
What do you think ?
Once upon a time the mo@@ on decided to send a mess@@ age to hum@@ ans down on E@@ ar@@ th inform@@ ing them that they would become im@@ mort@@ al and live for@@ ever .
The mess@@ age that ev@@ ent@@ ually arr@@ ived at he@@ ad@@ quar@@ ters was : Br@@ ing three or four p@@ ence , were going to a d@@ ance !
S@@ or@@ ry this is@@ n@@ t good en@@ ough , sh@@ ou@@ ted the mo@@ on and with these words he pic@@ ked up a p@@ i@@ ec@@ e of wood l@@ ying near@@ by and struc@@ k the h@@ are on the n@@ ose , s@@ pl@@ it@@ ting it in two .
The one I gave to the ant , but that you deliv@@ ered on his behalf ?
And what mess@@ age was that ?
O@@ f@@ f you go then , said the mo@@ on .
Now , it s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly occurred to What ex@@ ac@@ tly is your mess@@ age ? he asked .
H@@ ave you ever played the g@@ ame called Ch@@ in@@ ese Wh@@ is@@ per@@ s , where a wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed mess@@ age is passed from play@@ er to play@@ er ?
At this rem@@ ark the mo@@ on n@@ ar@@ row@@ ed his ey@@ es susp@@ ici@@ ously .
Yes , my l@@ ord , answ@@ ered the ant , b@@ ow@@ ing very low .
But th@@ ats the mess@@ age the ant gave me . ,
The answ@@ er , at least according to the S@@ an , is because a sim@@ ple mess@@ age went as@@ tr@@ ay and was@@ n@@ t deliv@@ ered correc@@ tly .
The ant set off , but while on his jour@@ ney he was over@@ taken by the h@@ are , who being rather nos@@ y said , Where are you going , ant ?
Be@@ fore long he was s@@ aying , E@@ very month I am b@@ orn , I di@@ e then I gre@@ et the d@@ aw@@ n .
I have decided that from now on this will also happ@@ en to them too .
For example , there is the st@@ ory of a general who , f@@ inding h@@ im@@ self under att@@ ack one day sent a run@@ ner back to he@@ ad@@ quar@@ ters with the instruc@@ tion : Br@@ ing re@@ in@@ forc@@ ements , were going to adv@@ ance !
This cy@@ c@@ le of birth , growth and death has been happ@@ ening for mil@@ li@@ ons of years and continues to happ@@ en to this day .
T@@ ell the hum@@ ans that every month I am b@@ orn , I gro@@ w , I di@@ e and then I get re@@ b@@ orn .
Yes , I have a mess@@ age that I have to deliv@@ er to all hum@@ ans .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually , the h@@ are re@@ ached the hum@@ ans , p@@ u@@ ff@@ ing out his ch@@ est , he said , I have been sent by the mo@@ on to deliv@@ er an important mess@@ age to you .
Se@@ e@@ ing the ang@@ ry look on the mo@@ ons face , the h@@ are s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly became so sc@@ ar@@ ed he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t rem@@ ember ex@@ ac@@ tly what h@@ ed said .
So why are hum@@ ans not im@@ mort@@ al like the mo@@ on ?
However , since the mo@@ on was@@ n@@ t able to visit the E@@ ar@@ th h@@ im@@ self , he decided to use an ant to carr@@ y the mess@@ age on his behalf .
Yes , my l@@ ord , said the ant .
T@@ H@@ E O@@ R@@ I@@ G@@ I@@ N O@@ F DE@@ AT@@ H
That some@@ one el@@ se did lik@@ ew@@ ise and so on .
We don@@ t understand your mess@@ age , one of them said .
The ant , who was already ti@@ red and k@@ new what a long jour@@ ney l@@ ay ah@@ e@@ ad of him , was only too pl@@ eased to acc@@ ept this offer .
Th@@ ats why people di@@ e at the end of their lives and never get re@@ b@@ orn as the mo@@ on intended them to and all than@@ ks to the h@@ are , some people would say .
May@@ be you should play Ch@@ in@@ ese Wh@@ is@@ per@@ s with your fri@@ ends and see what happ@@ ens to a mess@@ age that you send ?
The run@@ ner , un@@ able to make the whole jour@@ ney h@@ im@@ self , passed the mess@@ age to some@@ one el@@ se .
O@@ h , I@@ m sor@@ ry , said the mo@@ on , m@@ im@@ ic@@ king the h@@ are , though anyone look@@ ing on could see qu@@ ite clear@@ ly that he was@@ n@@ t .
The h@@ are d@@ id@@ n@@ t understand the mess@@ age either , but he was just the mess@@ eng@@ er , so why should that matter .
Yes , my l@@ ord , qu@@ ite clear .
And you rem@@ ember the mess@@ age word for word , do you ?
O@@ h , you can rem@@ ember the mean@@ ing , can you ?
A nom@@ ad is a person who do@@ es@@ n@@ t have a permanent home , but who mov@@ es from place to place .
And so the h@@ are set off , bo@@ unding across the land , all the time repe@@ ating the same mess@@ age to h@@ im@@ self as he went .
L@@ ook , remar@@ ked the h@@ are , y@@ our@@ e rather s@@ low and aw@@ kw@@ ard , ar@@ ent you ? - The ant just sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged - So why don@@ t you let me take the mess@@ age for you ?
I@@ m doing on an err@@ and for the mo@@ on , answ@@ ered the ant .
E@@ very month I am b@@ orn , I gro@@ w , I di@@ e and then I e@@ at cor@@ n .
That way it will get deliv@@ ered a lot qu@@ ick@@ er .
Th@@ en they held their bre@@ ath , wa@@ iting for him to speak .
H@@ ow d@@ are you t@@ ell hum@@ ans I said som@@ eth@@ ing that I d@@ id@@ n@@ t !
The hum@@ ans look@@ ed at him .
Now since that day the har@@ es n@@ ose has been s@@ pl@@ it and all hum@@ ans still believe what h@@ are once told their anc@@ est@@ ors .
F@@ rom now on this will happ@@ en to you too , answ@@ ered the ant who had f@@ ailed to in@@ form the mo@@ on that he was suff@@ ering from a small hear@@ ing problem .
But th@@ ats not the mess@@ age I gave the ant ! ro@@ ar@@ ed the mo@@ on .
Re@@ ally ? he said .
But per@@ h@@ aps were being too har@@ s@@ h on the h@@ are ?
Yes , the h@@ are said pro@@ udl@@ y .
An err@@ and ?
O@@ h , th@@ ats very inter@@ esting , said the h@@ are .
I for@@ get the ex@@ act words I used , my l@@ ord , he said n@@ erv@@ ously . But I can rem@@ ember the mean@@ ing .
O@@ K , he said , without a mom@@ ents p@@ ause .
In the following st@@ ory , the same thing happ@@ ens , a mess@@ age is sent but g@@ ets changed over time with dis@@ ast@@ ro@@ us consequ@@ ences for all concerned , you and I included .
I have a mess@@ age that I want you to give to all hum@@ ans , the mo@@ on said .
The S@@ an now live in or near the K@@ al@@ ah@@ ari Des@@ ert , which is a large dr@@ y w@@ ild@@ er@@ ness area cover@@ ing parts of Nam@@ ib@@ ia , B@@ ot@@ s@@ wana and nor@@ th-@@ w@@ est South Africa .
N@@ a@@ isa st@@ op@@ ped next to him and d@@ rop@@ ped her school sat@@ ch@@ el on the ground .
It was inter@@ esting .
A@@ ice s@@ at h@@ im@@ self on the ground next to his sis@@ ter and pic@@ ked up a st@@ one ar@@ ro@@ wh@@ e@@ ad that was l@@ ying am@@ ong@@ st the old man@@ s things then d@@ rop@@ ped it as s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly again when the old man sm@@ acked him on the hand .
I@@ m making an ar@@ ro@@ w , he said fin@@ ally .
A@@ ice , of course , was refer@@ ring to the fact that it was a cl@@ ever ide@@ a , not the tem@@ per@@ ature .
No , I don@@ t think so !
Yes , I have .
H@@ ey , you c@@ ant stop there , A@@ ice said .
I@@ ts a complete m@@ yst@@ ery to me , added A@@ ice , th@@ row@@ ing his hand@@ s out to emphas@@ ise the point .
L@@ ong , long before that , the old man m@@ ut@@ tered .
D@@ o@@ es it matter ? asked the old man .
The ol@@ den days .
Every@@ one k@@ new that A@@ ice h@@ ated school as much as she lo@@ v@@ ed it .
What are you doing , si@@ r ?
What about you , A@@ ice ?
Th@@ en one day the s@@ un@@ -@@ man was th@@ rown into the sk@@ y , he became ro@@ und and tur@@ ned into the su@@ n .
N@@ a@@ isa s@@ qu@@ at@@ ted down b@@ eside him .
What do you me@@ an by that , si@@ r ? she asked pol@@ it@@ ely , B@@ y the ol@@ den days I me@@ an ?
I pre@@ fer the col@@ d we@@ ather , N@@ a@@ isa said ig@@ nor@@ ing the incid@@ ent .
In the beg@@ inning , this s@@ un@@ -@@ man only gave off light and he@@ at around his own h@@ ut .
A@@ ice , who was about to make a rather r@@ ude sugg@@ es@@ tion changed his min@@ d when he saw the look that N@@ a@@ isa was g@@ iving him .
Ar@@ e you s@@ aying that the climate was different in the past ? she asked fin@@ ally .
The old man , who had long , str@@ agg@@ ly gre@@ y ha@@ ir and was we@@ aring a p@@ air of bl@@ ue j@@ e@@ ans and an old t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t fr@@ ay@@ ed around the nec@@ k , was so int@@ ent on what he was doing , he d@@ id@@ n@@ t notice the two of them approach until they were al@@ most standing over him .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
Th@@ ey@@ d had this conv@@ ers@@ ation a h@@ und@@ red times before and now it had al@@ most become a kind of run@@ ning jo@@ ke between them .
Our teach@@ er says that all the st@@ ars and plan@@ ets came about after a bi@@ g ban@@ g , he said , but the old man sim@@ ply ig@@ nor@@ ed him .
You say the su@@ n was th@@ rown up into the sk@@ y , right ?
I@@ ll si@@ t over here .
A@@ ice co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t help sm@@ il@@ ing at this rem@@ ark .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually , the old man put down the ar@@ ro@@ w again , w@@ ip@@ ed his fing@@ ers on his tro@@ users then look@@ ed at them both .
The climate changed when the S@@ an were the only people on E@@ ar@@ th , answ@@ ered the old man , p@@ ut@@ ting down the ar@@ ro@@ w and then pic@@ king up a leng@@ th of tw@@ ine .
Yes , she said pic@@ king up her ba@@ g and he@@ ading off down the road .
N@@ a@@ isa look@@ ed at her bro@@ ther , but his attention had dr@@ if@@ ted away again .
A@@ ice thre@@ w his sis@@ ter a look of dis@@ bel@@ ief .
F@@ u@@ n ? he repe@@ ated , like the word was new to him .
It was only after his young aud@@ ience was proper@@ ly se@@ ated , when N@@ a@@ isa had st@@ op@@ ped g@@ iving her bro@@ ther nas@@ ty look@@ s and when he had their full attention that he became serious again .
I@@ ts very ho@@ t today , she compl@@ ained .
After a long p@@ ause he said , Well , th@@ ats the inter@@ esting part .
No , we don@@ t , si@@ r , she said .
B@@ ene@@ ath a cl@@ ou@@ dl@@ ess sk@@ y the land was b@@ aking .
N@@ a@@ isa b@@ ent down and br@@ ush@@ ed some of the d@@ ust from her s@@ and@@ als with her finger@@ ti@@ ps .
I@@ ts ho@@ t today , A@@ ice said , st@@ op@@ ping to rem@@ ove his bas@@ eb@@ all ca@@ p then using it to w@@ ip@@ e the swe@@ at from his for@@ eh@@ e@@ ad .
He had g@@ one back to f@@ id@@ dl@@ ing with the ar@@ ro@@ w sh@@ aft , hol@@ ding it up to his e@@ ye , chec@@ king it for str@@ a@@ ight@@ ness .
N@@ ot if it was col@@ d like in the ol@@ den days you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t , the old man remar@@ ked .
Th@@ ats new@@ s to me , si@@ r , she said .
A@@ ice , who was t@@ wel@@ ve , and a year older than his sis@@ ter , sh@@ ook his head .
O@@ h , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely , si@@ r , A@@ ice answ@@ ered , though he d@@ id@@ n@@ t sound conv@@ inc@@ ing .
That was when he heard her A@@ ice say the d@@ read@@ ed words .
He had d@@ ark b@@ rown ha@@ ir that had the hab@@ it of flo@@ p@@ ping down across one e@@ ye .
The Su@@ n and the Ch@@ ild@@ ren is a S@@ an st@@ ory .
You me@@ an before we were b@@ orn ? .
G@@ ive me the w@@ int@@ er inst@@ e@@ ad of the summ@@ er any day .
D@@ id you know that according to leg@@ end our people were the first to live on the E@@ ar@@ th ? he asked .
What does that me@@ an : When the S@@ an were the only people on E@@ ar@@ th ? he asked his sis@@ ter .
The s@@ un@@ -@@ man would go to s@@ le@@ ep on the ground and some@@ times , when h@@ ed rol@@ l over or lif@@ t up his arms when he was dre@@ am@@ ing , the su@@ n would sh@@ ine .
The su@@ n and the mo@@ on , the old man continued , were orig@@ in@@ ally men who l@@ ived on E@@ ar@@ th .
The r@@ ice they had grow@@ n was ready for har@@ v@@ esting but the plants were very we@@ t and needed dr@@ ying out .
Ap@@ par@@ ently having fin@@ ished his st@@ ory , the old man pic@@ ked up his ar@@ ro@@ w again and beg@@ an shar@@ p@@ ening one end against a st@@ one .
Th@@ en he gr@@ in@@ ned at his sis@@ ter .
Our people had a problem , he beg@@ an .
Wh@@ y don@@ t you si@@ t on that st@@ one over there , N@@ a@@ isa , he said g@@ iving her a hard sh@@ ove in the back and al@@ most s@@ ending her spr@@ aw@@ ling .
W@@ ould you like to he@@ ar it ? .
N@@ a@@ isa gl@@ anced across at her bro@@ ther then decided to answ@@ er for them both .
N@@ a@@ isa sh@@ ook her head .
Th@@ en t@@ ell us how they did it , dem@@ anded A@@ ice .
A@@ ice , who had only been half l@@ ist@@ ening to the conv@@ ers@@ ation , now look@@ ed conf@@ used .
You see , it was children . It was children just like you who put the su@@ n in the sk@@ y .
At first the old man look@@ ed ready to arg@@ ue the point then he se@@ em@@ ed to think better of the ide@@ a .
They came across the old man sitting at the side of the road in the sh@@ ade of a ba@@ ob@@ a@@ b t@@ ree ten min@@ utes later .
But its just an old , b@@ or@@ ing old leg@@ end , said the man , who se@@ em@@ ed to have lost his interest in the whole aff@@ air .
What is more inter@@ esting is that it was the children of these first people who thre@@ w the su@@ n up into the sk@@ y .
N@@ a@@ isa , who considered her@@ self som@@ eth@@ ing of a geograph@@ er , th@@ ought about this for a mom@@ ent .
A st@@ ory ?
The tro@@ ub@@ le was , the s@@ un@@ -@@ man sp@@ ent most of his time as@@ le@@ ep on the ground so it was always col@@ d and d@@ ark .
The su@@ n sh@@ one from the man@@ s arm@@ p@@ its , the old man said .
Y@@ ear@@ s and years ago ? .
I don@@ t think inter@@ esting is a good word to des@@ cr@@ ibe school , he called out . I pre@@ fer b@@ or@@ ing or d@@ ul@@ l .
We d@@ id@@ n@@ t cre@@ ep up on you .
You hav@@ ent fin@@ ished your st@@ ory .
So you me@@ an every@@ where el@@ se was col@@ d and d@@ ark ? said N@@ a@@ isa .
Th@@ en m@@ ay@@ be I should t@@ ell you the st@@ ory .
No , we don@@ t , si@@ r , she re@@ pl@@ ied g@@ lar@@ ing m@@ en@@ ac@@ ingly at her bro@@ ther .
Yes , of course it matters !
She was s@@ li@@ m and pre@@ t@@ ty and her ey@@ es n@@ ar@@ row@@ ed as she fi@@ x@@ ed them on a line of dist@@ ant h@@ ills , sh@@ imm@@ ering in the he@@ at h@@ aze .
So you don@@ t know about the time when we were the only people of E@@ ar@@ th ? the old man asked .
I@@ ts wr@@ ong to p@@ ick up things that don@@ t bel@@ ong to you , he said .
P@@ ush@@ ing it back with his for@@ ear@@ m , he replac@@ ed his h@@ at and set off after her .
A@@ ice said , ca@@ using the old man to j@@ er@@ k with a sh@@ ock and to dro@@ p the p@@ i@@ ec@@ e of wood he was working on .
And you hav@@ ent told us who did the th@@ row@@ ing either , added N@@ a@@ isa .
Now he was star@@ ing up into the br@@ an@@ ches high above them .
The dr@@ y and d@@ us@@ ty road that A@@ ice and his sis@@ ter N@@ i@@ asa were wal@@ king along c@@ ut through a m@@ i@@ x of par@@ ched s@@ cru@@ b land , s@@ and d@@ un@@ es and sh@@ allow r@@ iver b@@ eds that only carried water after the heav@@ y summ@@ er r@@ ains .
The old man , mean@@ while , se@@ em@@ ed to be wat@@ ching their an@@ tics with some am@@ us@@ ement .
You just d@@ id@@ n@@ t he@@ ar us , N@@ a@@ isa said .
The rest of the time it was col@@ d and d@@ ark .
Y@@ our@@ e the b@@ or@@ ing one , she sh@@ ou@@ ted then r@@ an off la@@ ugh@@ ing down the road before he had time to answ@@ er .
N@@ a@@ isa just sh@@ ook her head .
School was fu@@ n today , she said .
Y@@ ear@@ s ago .
No , you hav@@ ent !
You sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t cre@@ ep up on a person like that , he said shar@@ ply .
T@@ H@@ E S@@ UN AN@@ D T@@ H@@ E CH@@ I@@ L@@ D@@ R@@ E@@ N
Please t@@ ell us , beg@@ ged N@@ a@@ isa , I h@@ ate it when I only get half a st@@ ory .
The old man se@@ em@@ ed to need time to think about this .
Yes , w@@ ed lo@@ ve to he@@ ar the st@@ ory , si@@ r , she said then th@@ row@@ ing her bro@@ ther a shar@@ p look , wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t we , A@@ ice ? .
H@@ er bro@@ ther just sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged .
This time it was the old man@@ s tur@@ n to sh@@ ru@@ g , but you hav@@ ent told us how this happ@@ ened .
Th@@ en he fi@@ x@@ ed his ey@@ es on A@@ ice .
N@@ a@@ isa , mean@@ while was get@@ ting to her fe@@ et and str@@ a@@ ight@@ ening out her d@@ ress .
That so@@ unds dang@@ erous , N@@ a@@ isa remar@@ ked then m@@ ou@@ th@@ ed the word S@@ or@@ ry when she saw the look the old man was g@@ iving her .
A@@ ny@@ way , the old man continued , L@@ ater that day , the two children saw the s@@ un@@ -@@ man l@@ ying on the ground and cre@@ p@@ t over to him .
She had a plan to change things .
Th@@ ats why I carr@@ y this sti@@ c@@ k with me , he said , hol@@ ding up a t@@ ree branch .
The mom@@ ent I close my ey@@ es , the mo@@ on comes out .
It was the gir@@ l who was the first to find her vo@@ ice , he continued .
When he saw the two children hol@@ ding onto his el@@ b@@ ow@@ s he said , What do you two think y@@ our@@ e doing ?
Yes , it was a very good ide@@ a , N@@ a@@ isa agreed .
If I have your permission that is ? the old man said look@@ ing very d@@ ar@@ k@@ ly at A@@ ice .
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h , D@@ u@@ h !
I me@@ an , some@@ times the mo@@ on comes out at night and then its qu@@ i@@ et br@@ ight , but .
Wh@@ ats so wr@@ ong about that ? s@@ n@@ app@@ ed N@@ a@@ isa .
What do you me@@ an you need my help ? the s@@ un@@ -@@ man asked .
So the bo@@ y and the gir@@ l go@@ t some sk@@ ins and then when every@@ thing was ready the gir@@ l coun@@ ted one , two , three , then they lif@@ ted up the s@@ un@@ -@@ man@@ s el@@ b@@ ow@@ s .
Th@@ en the job would be qu@@ ick and eas@@ y , don@@ t you think so , S@@ is ? .
They sho@@ ul@@ d@@ ve done that in the first place , said A@@ ice , know@@ ingly .
That was sil@@ ly of him , gr@@ umb@@ led A@@ ice .
N@@ a@@ isa , however , ch@@ ose not to answ@@ er .
And do you know what she did ?
I hav@@ ent go@@ t to the end of the st@@ ory yet , so m@@ ay@@ be I should f@@ inis@@ h it .
The bo@@ y and gir@@ l pl@@ e@@ aded with the su@@ n man .
She told her children that if the s@@ un@@ man w@@ oke up they were to t@@ ell him to do his job .
Th@@ en she j@@ er@@ ked her arm back .
Pl@@ an B , said A@@ ice hel@@ p@@ fully .
So , do you want to he@@ ar the st@@ ory or not ? .
O@@ f course the s@@ un@@ -@@ man was ho@@ t !
The wom@@ ans plan was that her son would take hold of the s@@ un@@ -@@ man@@ s left el@@ bo@@ w and her d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter would take hold of his right el@@ bo@@ w and then , on her sign@@ al , they would lif@@ t them up .
Th@@ en he look@@ ed at N@@ a@@ isa .
D@@ o you re@@ ally ? .
He so@@ unds gr@@ ump@@ y , said N@@ a@@ isa , but the old man d@@ id@@ n@@ t answ@@ er her .
When it g@@ ets too bi@@ g and too bo@@ ast@@ ful I use this sti@@ c@@ k to pro@@ d it until it bur@@ s@@ ts like a bal@@ lo@@ on .
What do you me@@ an she had a plan ? asked A@@ ice .
The mo@@ on go@@ t th@@ rown up into the sk@@ y by the children , too , the old man expl@@ ained .
Well , m@@ ay@@ be the gir@@ l th@@ ought h@@ ed be w@@ arm not ho@@ t .
The m@@ others plan was sim@@ ple : All the v@@ ill@@ age children h@@ id around the s@@ un@@ man@@ s house .
D@@ o you two think you could stop arg@@ u@@ ing ? said the old man , look@@ ing from one to the other .
That was when the s@@ un@@ man came to life ang@@ ry at being dis@@ tur@@ bed .
Y@@ ou@@ d need some very th@@ ick g@@ lo@@ ves , her bro@@ ther said when they were a h@@ und@@ red met@@ res down the road . To p@@ ick up the su@@ n , I me@@ an .
That was a very inter@@ esting st@@ ory , si@@ r , he said , but I think N@@ a@@ isa and I would have done a much better job of get@@ ting the s@@ un@@ -@@ man into the sk@@ y than the children in your st@@ ory .
So y@@ our@@ e t@@ elling us the s@@ un@@ -@@ man was so l@@ az@@ y he just l@@ ay on the ground all the time , said A@@ ice .
I always think its very important to have a Pl@@ an B ? A@@ ice remar@@ ked look@@ ing very pl@@ eased with h@@ im@@ self .
Yes , I sup@@ pose so , A@@ ice agreed , look@@ ing rather th@@ oug@@ h@@ t@@ ful .
A@@ ice was draw@@ ing a cir@@ c@@ le on the ground with his f@@ oo@@ t and then next to it another sm@@ all@@ er cir@@ c@@ le .
The s@@ un@@ -@@ man was very ho@@ t , you see .
Th@@ ank you , si@@ r , she said .
And the mo@@ on ? asked N@@ a@@ isa .
A@@ ice m@@ ut@@ tered som@@ eth@@ ing under his bre@@ ath that ne@@ ither of them could he@@ ar , but d@@ id@@ n@@ t arg@@ ue the point .
If you ask me , h@@ es not a very n@@ ice person , remar@@ ked N@@ a@@ isa .
Mr S@@ un@@ -@@ man , she said very pol@@ it@@ ely , we need your help .
Yes , th@@ ats right .
H@@ is job was to f@@ ly across the sk@@ y with his arms out so that the su@@ n sh@@ one down on the r@@ ice fiel@@ ds .
The bo@@ y and the gir@@ l went home to their m@@ other , taking with them the b@@ ad new@@ s that the s@@ un@@ -@@ man wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t help them .
What did she expec@@ t ?
She told her children to cre@@ ep up on the s@@ un@@ -@@ man when he was as@@ le@@ ep .
She called her children to her .
Please carr@@ y on , si@@ r , said N@@ a@@ isa . M@@ y bro@@ ther w@@ on@@ t inter@@ rup@@ t again , will you , A@@ ice ?
One of the m@@ others had an ide@@ a however .
E@@ very month the mo@@ on g@@ ets b@@ igg@@ er and b@@ igg@@ er .
He was s@@ nor@@ ing l@@ ou@@ dly and very s@@ low@@ ly the gir@@ l re@@ ached out and t@@ ou@@ ched him on the hand .
But I th@@ ought she was sup@@ posed to t@@ ell the s@@ un@@ -@@ man to do his job ? said A@@ ice .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , a bl@@ ast of he@@ at and bl@@ inding light sp@@ illed out onto the ground .
That was when the little gir@@ l told the s@@ un@@ -@@ man how col@@ d they were and that they needed the s@@ un@@ light from his arm@@ p@@ its to dr@@ y the r@@ ice the@@ y@@ d grow@@ n , but the s@@ un@@ man d@@ id@@ n@@ t se@@ em to care much about their problems .
She expl@@ ained to her children that all the he@@ at and light in the world came from the s@@ un@@ -@@ man@@ s arm@@ p@@ its , but that it st@@ ay@@ ed col@@ d and d@@ ark because he l@@ ay on the ground most of the time .
R@@ ight ? . I gu@@ ess so , A@@ ice g@@ igg@@ led .
D@@ on@@ t tal@@ k to me about the mo@@ on , the s@@ un@@ -@@ man sh@@ ou@@ ted .
That was when the s@@ un@@ -@@ man became very c@@ ross .
No , si@@ r , we don@@ t , N@@ a@@ isa answ@@ ered .
But she had a plan .
O@@ f course I@@ m right ! he re@@ tor@@ ted , but then I@@ m always right , ar@@ ent I ? he added with a gr@@ in .
O@@ h , the woman had th@@ ought of that , too .
The mom@@ ent the bo@@ y mentioned the word mo@@ on he went red in the face and look@@ ed very ang@@ ry .
Yes , si@@ r .
Is your bro@@ ther always like this ? he asked .
A@@ ice look@@ ed at his sis@@ ter .
Yes , A@@ ice , she said pati@@ ently , I@@ m sure y@@ our@@ e right .
Th@@ en to her bro@@ ther , Com@@ e , A@@ ice , we@@ ve go@@ t to get home now .
D@@ o his job ! A@@ ice la@@ ugh@@ ed .
Re@@ ally ? . Yes .
And I th@@ ought you said you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t inter@@ rup@@ t again ! the old man said d@@ ar@@ ting a look at him .
But what would happ@@ en if the s@@ un@@ -@@ man w@@ oke up ? asked N@@ a@@ isa .
Yes , well she d@@ id@@ n@@ t , did she , answ@@ ered the old man , so@@ unding even more ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated , if that were possible .
When he f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep again , they all r@@ ush@@ ed up , gr@@ ab@@ bed his arms and leg@@ s and thre@@ w him up into the sk@@ y , where he gre@@ w bi@@ g and f@@ at and tur@@ ned into the su@@ n .
I th@@ ought you said that he went to live in the sk@@ y ? .
After that all th@@ ats left is its back@@ b@@ one , which is how the new mo@@ on is b@@ orn .
I wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t do that , said A@@ ice .
That was when the gir@@ l came up with the ide@@ a of wr@@ app@@ ing some sk@@ ins around the s@@ un@@ man@@ s el@@ b@@ ow@@ s so that they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t bur@@ n their fing@@ ers when they lif@@ ted up his arms .
It star@@ ts small and th@@ in , s@@ low@@ ly g@@ ets b@@ igg@@ er and b@@ igg@@ er until the su@@ n p@@ ok@@ es it with its sti@@ c@@ k then the cy@@ c@@ le beg@@ ins again .
No , I@@ m sure you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t , the old man said g@@ iving him a hard look , but the two children in the st@@ ory were pol@@ ite and did what they were told .
I@@ m sor@@ ry my bro@@ ther se@@ ems to have left his man@@ ners at home today .
And one of those th@@ ick j@@ ack@@ ets and a prot@@ ective hel@@ m@@ et , the type that fir@@ em@@ en we@@ ar .
It follow@@ s me every@@ where .
I like to s@@ le@@ ep in the d@@ ark too , agreed her bro@@ ther .
I@@ ts so full of its own importance it s@@ well@@ s up .
Th@@ ings don@@ t always go as plan@@ ned , you know !
That was a good ide@@ a , was@@ n@@ t it ?
The bo@@ y t@@ ou@@ ched the s@@ un@@ -@@ man@@ s el@@ bo@@ w too , and he also j@@ er@@ ked his hand back because h@@ ed bur@@ n@@ t his fing@@ ers .
Th@@ en he gave a h@@ ug@@ e sig@@ h and told them to go away and leave him al@@ one .
You carr@@ y on , si@@ r , he said very gener@@ ously , making the old man close his ey@@ es for a mom@@ ent before continu@@ ing .
N@@ a@@ isa just sh@@ r@@ ug@@ ged as if to say that she co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ t understand b@@ oy@@ s either .
The s@@ un@@ -@@ man ey@@ ed the gir@@ l very susp@@ ici@@ ously , said the old man , pic@@ king up the st@@ ory where he had left off .
That was when all the m@@ others go@@ t together and came up with a second plan .
C@@ ant you see how d@@ ark and col@@ d it is ? they said , but the su@@ n man said that he lik@@ ed the d@@ ark because he s@@ le@@ p@@ t better .

The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today , as I have been priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed to do in previous years , was formed in 200@@ 4 , after the General Elec@@ tions of that year .
to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate the process of renewal of the African continent ;
May@@ ors and leaders in our system of local government ;
to implement det@@ ailed programmes to respon@@ d to the challenges of the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y ;
Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson ;
I am happ@@ y to report that with regard to each of these commit@@ ments , government remains hard at work to ensure that the n@@ ations objectives are m@@ et .
I also know of the great pr@@ ide fel@@ t by those who have been ad@@ mitted into the r@@ an@@ ks of the em@@ in@@ ent National Or@@ ders .
H@@ aving under@@ st@@ ood this , it was natural that we should put the question to our@@ selves what progress have we made in the qu@@ est to achieve the objectives to which we hon@@ est@@ ly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing authority to g@@ over@@ n our country from 200@@ 4 until the next elections in 200@@ 9 !
President N@@ el@@ son Mandela and Mad@@ ame G@@ rac@@ a M@@ ach@@ el ;
Inv@@ est@@ ment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with over@@ all public sector infrastructure sp@@ ending increasing by an annual av@@ er@@ age of 15 ,@@ 8 .
But because we also k@@ new that she had the t@@ en@@ ac@@ ity of spirit and streng@@ th of will to sol@@ di@@ er on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our gu@@ ests on this a@@ ug@@ ust occas@@ ion . But that was not to be .
increas@@ ingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions fac@@ ing peo@@ ples of the world .
H@@ is death was as sh@@ oc@@ king and m@@ yst@@ er@@ ious as his life was a lo@@ dest@@ ar point@@ ing us to the freedom we en@@ jo@@ y today .
D@@ ist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished Premi@@ ers and Spe@@ ak@@ ers of our Provinces ;
to improve our export performance , foc@@ us@@ sing on services and manufac@@ tured goods ;
to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the housing programme ;
We are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged that our General Elec@@ tions of a for@@ t@@ night ago confirm@@ ed the determin@@ ation of all our people , reg@@ ar@@ dl@@ ess of r@@ ace , col@@ our and eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am
I am also pl@@ eased to welcome to the House the activ@@ ists of the 19@@ 5@@ 6 W@@ om@@ ens Mar@@ ch and the 197@@ 6 S@@ oweto U@@ pr@@ ising who are sitting in the Presid@@ ents bo@@ x , as well as the em@@ in@@ ent pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts from all our provinces , proposed by our Provincial Spe@@ ak@@ ers to jo@@ in the group of important gu@@ ests who have jo@@ ined us today .
to implement additional measures to open wid@@ er the do@@ ors of learning and of culture ;
At an av@@ er@@ age of over 4 ,@@ 5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its high@@ est since we att@@ ained our democracy in 199@@ 4 .
We must continue to respon@@ d to the pers@@ pec@@ tive we spo@@ ke of as the present government beg@@ an its term of office , fully cons@@ ci@@ ous that n@@ one of the great social problems we have to sol@@ ve is cap@@ able of resolution outside the context of the cre@@ ation of j@@ obs and the all@@ ev@@ iation and er@@ ad@@ ication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate poverty has been and will continue to be a centr@@ al part of the national effort to build the new South Africa .
to implement programmes to ensure broad@@ -based black economic empow@@ erment ;
We must today ren@@ ew our pl@@ ed@@ ge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to re@@ alise the happ@@ iness for all that should come with lib@@ er@@ ty , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am , to say , together , in action en@@ ough of every@@ thing that made our country to cont@@ ain within it and re@@ present much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society !
D@@ ist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished gu@@ ests , fri@@ ends and com@@ r@@ ades ;
It was a place in which to be b@@ orn black was to in@@ her@@ it a lif@@ el@@ ong cur@@ se .
It was a place in which s@@ qu@@ al@@ or , the st@@ enc@@ h of poverty , the open se@@ w@@ ers , the dec@@ aying ro@@ t , the m@@ illing crow@@ ds of w@@ ret@@ ch@@ ed@@ ness , the un@@ ending im@@ ages of a land@@ s@@ cape stre@@ w@@ n with car@@ el@@ ess@@ ly aband@@ oned ref@@ use , ass@@ um@@ ed an aspec@@ t that se@@ em@@ ed necessary to enh@@ ance the be@@ a@@ uty of another world of ti@@ d@@ y stre@@ ets , and wo@@ od@@ ed lan@@ es , and f@@ low@@ ers bl@@ os@@ som@@ s off@@ setting the gre@@ en and sing@@ ing gr@@ ass , and bir@@ ds and houses f@@ it for k@@ ings and qu@@ e@@ ens , and l@@ y@@ r@@ ical mus@@ ic , and lo@@ ve .
Director@@ s-@@ General and other leaders of the public service ;
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the N@@ C@@ O@@ P ; I fe@@ el imm@@ ens@@ ely pro@@ ud that democratic South Africa has had the s@@ ense and s@@ ensi@@ tiv@@ ity to acknow@@ ledge what Al@@ ber@@ t L@@ uth@@ uli and Ol@@ iver T@@ ambo me@@ an to our nation by nam@@ ing two of our National Or@@ ders after them - the Or@@ der of L@@ uth@@ uli , and the Or@@ der of the Comp@@ an@@ ions of O .@@ R .
Res@@ p@@ ond@@ ing to the im@@ per@@ ative to m@@ ove forward as qu@@ ick@@ ly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am , our government committed itself , working with all South Africans , to implement det@@ ailed programmes intended :
It was a place in which to live in some places was to inv@@ ite others to pre@@ y on you or to con@@ dem@@ n on@@ es@@ el@@ f to pre@@ y on others , guaran@@ te@@ ed neighb@@ ours who could not but f@@ all victim to al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and drug st@@ u@@ por@@ s that would d@@ ul@@ l the p@@ ain of living , who k@@ new that their lives would not be normal without murder in their mid@@ st , and rap@@ e and br@@ ut@@ al personal w@@ ars without a cause .
We have seen ste@@ ad@@ y progress in the adv@@ anc@@ ement of Bl@@ ack people in the economy .
to exp@@ and access to such services as water , electricity and s@@ an@@ itation ;
to improve the health prof@@ ile of the nation as a whole ;
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
Mad@@ am Speaker of the National Assembly ;

T@@ oday , fi@@ x@@ ed investment as a per@@ cent@@ age of G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Produc@@ t at about 18 ,@@ 4 is at its high@@ est since 199@@ 1 .
We pl@@ ed@@ ge to all the her@@ o@@ es and her@@ o@@ ines who s@@ ac@@ r@@ ific@@ ed for our freedom , as well as to you , our fri@@ ends from the rest of the world , that we will never be@@ tr@@ ay the trust you b@@ est@@ ow@@ ed on us when you hel@@ ped to give us the possib@@ ility to trans@@ form South Africa into a democratic , peac@@ eful , non@@ racial , n@@ ons@@ ex@@ ist and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous country , committed to the nob@@ le v@@ ision of human sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity .
Once more , we conv@@ ey our cond@@ ol@@ ences to the T@@ ambo family .

G@@ overn@@ or of the Res@@ erve Bank ;
However , I am ind@@ eed very pl@@ eased to acknow@@ ledge in our mid@@ st this morning the H@@ on Al@@ ber@@ t@@ ina L@@ uth@@ uli , d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter of our first N@@ ob@@ el Pe@@ ace L@@ au@@ re@@ ate , In@@ k@@ osi Al@@ ber@@ t L@@ uth@@ uli , whose tr@@ ag@@ ic death 4@@ 0 years ago we comm@@ emor@@ ate this year , rem@@ emb@@ ering the tr@@ ag@@ ic day when it was reported that he had been cr@@ ush@@ ed by a spe@@ eding tr@@ ain in the can@@ e-@@ fiel@@ ds of Kwa@@ D@@ ukuz@@ a .
On that occas@@ ion we said in part :
It was a place in which to be b@@ orn white was to carr@@ y a permanent bur@@ den of fe@@ ar and h@@ id@@ den r@@ age
At its annual J@@ an@@ u@@ ary L@@ ek@@ g@@ ot@@ la or B@@ os@@ ber@@ a@@ ad last month , the National Cabinet that stand@@ s at the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of the system of govern@@ ance over which we are priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed to pr@@ eside , refl@@ ected on the fact that its meeting mar@@ ked the mid@@ -@@ term of the life of the government b@@ orn of our last , 200@@ 4 , elections .
to ensure that the public sector dis@@ charges its responsib@@ ilities as a critical play@@ er in the growth , re@@ construction and development of our country ;
N@@ one of the great social problems we have to sol@@ ve is cap@@ able of resolution outside the context of the cre@@ ation of j@@ obs and the all@@ ev@@ iation and er@@ ad@@ ication of poverty .
Th@@ us she will only be with us in spirit when in Oc@@ t@@ ob@@ er this year , we celeb@@ rate the 9@@ 0@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the birth of her h@@ us@@ band , the f@@ ather of her children , her comp@@ an@@ ion , her com@@ r@@ ade , and an em@@ in@@ ent son of our people , Ol@@ iver Reg@@ in@@ al@@ d T@@ ambo .

F@@ if@@ ty years before , as they prepar@@ ed to conv@@ ene the Cong@@ ress of the Pe@@ o@@ ple , which adopted the Fre@@ edom Char@@ ter , the pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts of the day had said , Let us speak together , all of us together African and Europe@@ an , Indi@@ an and Col@@ our@@ ed all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom . And of the happ@@ iness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .
When she d@@ ied , we k@@ new that M@@ ama A@@ del@@ a@@ ide T@@ ambo had been recently dis@@ charged from hospital .
T@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w we will pay her our last respec@@ ts as we int@@ er her remains .

That work will continue during our Sec@@ ond Dec@@ ade of Fre@@ edom .
Our est@@ e@@ em@@ ed Chief Justice and members of the Jud@@ ici@@ ary ;
With your ind@@ ul@@ g@@ ence , I would like to st@@ ep further back , and rec@@ all what we said , in 200@@ 4 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our fri@@ ends from the rest of the world , conven@@ ed at our se@@ at of government the Union Bu@@ ild@@ ings in Tsh@@ wane on Fre@@ edom D@@ ay , the 10@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of our lib@@ eration , and particip@@ ated in the In@@ a@@ ug@@ uration of the President of the Republic , whom our Parliament had ch@@ os@@ en , respec@@ ting the will of the people democ@@ r@@ atic@@ ally demonstr@@ ated during the 200@@ 4 elections .
Our hon@@ our@@ ed traditional leaders ;
This rel@@ ates to every@@ thing , from the improv@@ ement of the health of our people , to reduc@@ ing the levels of crime , ra@@ ising the levels of lit@@ er@@ acy and n@@ um@@ er@@ acy , and op@@ ening the do@@ ors of learning and culture to all

State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress of the President of South Africa , Th@@ abo Mb@@ eki : Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament Febru@@ ary 200@@ 7
For too long our country cont@@ ained within it and represented much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society
He@@ ads of the state org@@ ans supporting our constitutional democracy ;
to promote the growth of the small and medi@@ um business sector ;
to increase sp@@ ending on scientific research and development ;
Pe@@ o@@ ple of South Africa :
We have gath@@ ered here today , on Fre@@ edom D@@ ay , because in time , our people , together with the bil@@ li@@ ons of human be@@ ings across the glob@@ e , who are our com@@ r@@ ad@@ es@@ -@@ in-@@ arms and whom our dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished gu@@ ests re@@ present , decided to say an end to all that !
Wh@@ ile the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion programme has resul@@ ted in more settl@@ ements in the recent period , we still need to put in extr@@ a effort in dealing with rem@@ aining cases , many of which are much more comple@@ x .
In this context , address all ind@@ igence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ;
The housing programme has seen close to 3@@ 00 000 new subsid@@ ies allocated in the past two years .
This is centr@@ al to our efforts to er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happ@@ iness that comes with lib@@ er@@ ty .
It is encour@@ ag@@ ing that in the year Mar@@ ch 200@@ 5 to Mar@@ ch 200@@ 6 al@@ one , 3@@ 00 000 of the j@@ obs created were in the formal sector outside of agr@@ iculture , represent@@ ing a growth rate of about 4 .
Y@@ et we must remain concerned that these figures are still wo@@ eful@@ ly low .
As such , in the period lead@@ ing up to 200@@ 9 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our ag@@ enda .
A critical le@@ g of these social interventions should be the int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ication of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
What has emerg@@ ed , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public serv@@ ants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institu@@ te which in ac@@ tual fact should be the major service provid@@ er including in the m@@ ass ind@@ uc@@ tion of public serv@@ ants .
These include the tax@@ i rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Mol@@ oto R@@ ail Cor@@ rid@@ or in Mp@@ umalanga around which fe@@ as@@ ib@@ ility work has started , the K@@ l@@ ip@@ fontein Cor@@ rid@@ or in Cape Town and the G@@ au@@ tr@@ ain project with its link@@ ages to the rest of the public transport system .
It is encour@@ ag@@ ing that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the recent period , been within manag@@ e@@ able r@@ ang@@ es , as the programmes re@@ ach mat@@ urity .
D@@ evel@@ op a proper database of hous@@ ehol@@ ds living in poverty ;
For inst@@ ance , in S@@ ep@@ t@@ ember last year , 2@@ 7 of municipalities did not have municipal manag@@ ers ; in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Provin@@ ce , the vacancy rate at s@@ enior management level was over 50 ; and in Mp@@ umalanga only 1 of s@@ enior manag@@ ers had con@@ clud@@ ed K@@ ey Per@@ form@@ ance A@@ gre@@ ements .
We also continue to show we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in implementing the Ad@@ ul@@ t Bas@@ ic Education programme .
It is a matter of pr@@ ide that , in line with our commitment to build a car@@ ing society , we have since 200@@ 4 improved service provision and other aspec@@ ts of the social w@@ age .
In other words , measures required to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on cannot be undertaken by government al@@ one . We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from mor@@ al dec@@ ay , and work to att@@ ain the happ@@ iness that comes with it .
Wh@@ ile we have reduc@@ ed the inc@@ idence of most contact crimes , the annual reduc@@ tion rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assaul@@ t and murder is still below the 7@@ -@@ 10 that we had targeted .
Compl@@ iance levels within departments , in rel@@ ation to public service and fin@@ ance management legislation , have been some@@ what m@@ ix@@ ed .
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vac@@ an@@ cies remain or have emerg@@ ed in s@@ enior management and the profes@@ sions .
This will ensure the syst@@ em@@ atic link@@ age of benefici@@ aries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continu@@ ously foc@@ used on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible gr@@ ad@@ uate out of dep@@ end@@ ence on social gr@@ ants and ent@@ er the labour market .
The adv@@ ances in the economy have th@@ rown up major challenges for all of us .
I am certain that we shall all ag@@ ree that working together to achieve the happ@@ iness that comes with freedom applies equ@@ ally to the challenge of dealing with crime .
In this year of the 6@@ 0@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the Doc@@ tors P@@ act of leaders of African and Indi@@ an communities , the 3@@ 0@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the murder of S@@ te@@ ve B@@ iko and the 20@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the visit to D@@ ak@@ ar by Afr@@ i@@ kan@@ er intell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of id@@ enti@@ ties and the over@@ arch@@ ing s@@ ense of belong@@ ing to South Africa needs to be better can@@ v@@ ass@@ ed across society , in a manner that strength@@ ens our unity as a nation .
As H@@ on@@ our@@ able members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improv@@ ing pass@@ eng@@ er transport .
Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ate the training of F@@ am@@ ily Social Wor@@ k@@ ers at professional and au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary levels to ensure that identified hous@@ ehol@@ ds are proper@@ ly supported and monitor@@ ed .
However , as we s@@ ought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being mis@@ sed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the p@@ ace of rol@@ l@@ -@@ out has been much s@@ lower than we expected .
These p@@ il@@ ot projects should be completed by the end of this year .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observ@@ ation that aud@@ iting requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent .
In this regard , in order further to spe@@ ed up the implementation of As@@ gi@@ SA , over and above the multi-@@ year programmes announc@@ ed in the recent past , government will this year :
and the propor@@ tion of Bl@@ acks in top management has grow@@ n from 24 of the total to 2@@ 7 . F@@ rom ow@@ ning just over 3 of the market cap@@ it@@ alisation of the J@@ S@@ E in 200@@ 4 , this has increas@@ ed to close on to 5 ;
According to the United Nations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that sp@@ end less on military bud@@ g@@ ets than on water and s@@ an@@ itation .
Pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing peace and security will inv@@ olve all people .
C@@ o-@@ ordin@@ ate and al@@ ign all anti-@@ poverty programmes to max@@ im@@ ise impact and avo@@ id w@@ ast@@ age and du@@ plication ;
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for s@@ enior management is cru@@ cial .
I would like to take advant@@ age of this occas@@ ion to expres@@ s my gr@@ ati@@ t@@ ude to Deputy President P@@ hum@@ z@@ ile M@@ l@@ amb@@ o-@@ Ng@@ c@@ uka for the in@@ spir@@ ing lead@@ ership she has given to the implementation of the Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated and Sh@@ ar@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative , working with the Ministers and Premi@@ ers who constitu@@ te the T@@ ask Te@@ am , con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely addres@@ sing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure high@@ er rates of investment and lab@@ our@@ -@@ ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , as well as matters per@@ taining to skills development and the effici@@ ency of the state system .
In the words of the UN@@ D@@ P Hum@@ an Development Report of 200@@ 6 :
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , we must continue and further int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the struggle against crime .
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme . But there is no question that this programme can and must be r@@ at@@ ch@@ eted up@@ wards qu@@ ite signific@@ antly .
We should ind@@ eed celeb@@ rate this great achiev@@ ement .
But it is a fact that 8 mil@@ lion people are still without pot@@ able water . Many more are without electricity and s@@ an@@ itation .
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improv@@ ing the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expec@@ t@@ ations of the public , in which h@@ ug@@ e resources are exp@@ ended , are ac@@ tually m@@ et .
And the abuse of women and children continues at an un@@ accep@@ table level .
It is a matter of pro@@ ud record that over half of the dis@@ tric@@ ts and met@@ ro@@ s have held their G@@ row@@ th and Development Sum@@ mits , and the rest int@@ end to complete this process by the end of Febru@@ ary .
In the mean@@ time , we will continue to explor@@ e new initiatives which will progres@@ si@@ vely improve the social w@@ age .
O@@ ver the past three years , the economy has created some on@@ e-@@ and-@@ half mil@@ lion j@@ obs .
In the 199@@ 4 R@@ D@@ P Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er we said :
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , we cannot er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive and cl@@ aim the happ@@ iness that comes with freedom if communities live in fe@@ ar , clos@@ eted behind w@@ alls and b@@ ar@@ bed w@@ ire , ever an@@ x@@ ious in their houses , on the stre@@ ets and on our roads , un@@ able fre@@ ely to en@@ jo@@ y our public sp@@ ac@@ es .
It will build on and exp@@ and the national drive for peace and comb@@ at the end@@ em@@ ic violence fac@@ ed by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are sub@@ jec@@ ted
We continue to respon@@ d to these challenges and will under@@ take all necessary t@@ as@@ ks , informed by our F@@ ive Y@@ e@@ ar Local Government Strateg@@ ic Ag@@ enda , which includes hand@@ s-@@ on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , the deploy@@ ment of sk@@ illed personnel including professional volun@@ te@@ ers from the public , and strength@@ ening the W@@ ard Commit@@ tees 8@@ 0 of which have been established across the country .
Wh@@ ile household deb@@ t has increas@@ ed bro@@ adl@@ y at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that South Africans are s@@ aving less means that we have to dep@@ end on s@@ av@@ ings from other n@@ ations .
We are on course to put an end to this d@@ eh@@ um@@ anis@@ ing system in these areas by the end of this year .
in line with the National Indus@@ trial Pol@@ ic@@ y Fr@@ amework which has now been completed , we will :
This will l@@ ay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in spe@@ eding up local economic development .
On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land re@@ distribution .
F@@ rom the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things :
An exam@@ ination of education and skills ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion shows improv@@ ement of qu@@ ite a high base by 200@@ 4 , though at a s@@ low p@@ ace .
At the same time , the number of M@@ atr@@ ic stud@@ ents who p@@ ass M@@ ath@@ ematic@@ s at the high@@ er gr@@ ade is only sl@@ igh@@ tly better than in 199@@ 5 .
Wh@@ ile we have already sur@@ passed that targeted fig@@ ure of 1@@ 5@@ 2 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recogn@@ ise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high en@@ ough for every@@ body to fe@@ el a better s@@ ense of safety and security .
The continu@@ ing occas@@ ional v@@ ol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity of our curr@@ ency has also not bod@@ ed well for our export indus@@ tries .
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-@@ employment through small and mic@@ ro@@ -@@ enterprises .
Fur@@ ther , on this the 3@@ 0@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the ban@@ ning of The World and The We@@ ek@@ end World new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , we are d@@ ut@@ y-@@ b@@ ound to ask the question - have we all fully inter@@ n@@ alised our responsibility in building social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and promoting a common s@@ ense of belong@@ ing , re@@ in@@ forc@@ ing the gl@@ ue that hol@@ ds our nation together !
M@@ on@@ itor progress in these hous@@ ehol@@ ds as the programmes take effect in gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ating them out of poverty ;
complete the process of re@@ view@@ ing the countr@@ y@@ s experience in the ar@@ ticul@@ ation among such m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic indic@@ ators as the Ex@@ change R@@ ate , in@@ fl@@ ation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of indus@@ tries which produce trad@@ ables for both the domestic and export mar@@ kets , and have the potential to ab@@ sor@@ b large po@@ ols of sem@@ i-@@ sk@@ illed workers ;
H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members ;
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African W@@ om@@ en in Di@@ al@@ og@@ ue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as T@@ un@@ isi@@ a and Ch@@ ile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some def@@ ects in our systems in this regard .
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strateg@@ ies to reduce and er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate the poverty that continues to af@@ fl@@ ict many of our people .
B@@ y 200@@ 5 , South Africa had already achieved the M@@ ill@@ enn@@ ium Development Go@@ al in respect of basic water supply , with improv@@ ement of access from 5@@ 9 in 199@@ 4 to 8@@ 3 in 200@@ 6 .
D@@ ef@@ ine clear@@ ly the poverty mat@@ ri@@ x of our country ;
We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people .
We highl@@ y appreci@@ ate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service manag@@ ers , across the three s@@ pher@@ es of government , in lead@@ ing this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole .
Wh@@ ile benefici@@ aries of social gr@@ ants numb@@ ered about 8 mil@@ lion in 200@@ 4 , today 11 mil@@ lion poor South Africans have access to these gr@@ ants .
The increase in the inc@@ idence of particular crimes during the security workers str@@ ike should have b@@ roug@@ ht home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handl@@ ed sim@@ ply as a private aff@@ air of the private sector .
South Africa has demonstr@@ ated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanis@@ m for empow@@ erment and a gu@@ ide to policy R@@ ight@@ s-@@ based water re@@ form has en@@ abled it to exp@@ and access and over@@ come the leg@@ acy of racial in@@ equ@@ ality in@@ her@@ ited from apartheid , part@@ ly through right@@ s-@@ based enti@@ tl@@ ements .
We will also continue to put more effort into improv@@ ing the func@@ tion@@ ing of our courts , to increase the rate of reduc@@ tion in case back@@ log@@ s .
But our international trade bal@@ ance shows that we have not succ@@ e@@ eded in building the capacity to produce the cons@@ um@@ er and capital goods that our country needs .
and the major infrastructure projects that we are emb@@ ar@@ king on dem@@ and mas@@ sive in@@ put of suppl@@ ies and mach@@ in@@ ery .
This applies to lit@@ er@@ acy levels , gro@@ s@@ s school en@@ rol@@ ment and ter@@ ti@@ ary participation rates .
This will ensure sus@@ tain@@ ability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more j@@ obs and business opportunities .
This applies to such issues as w@@ age levels , personnel v@@ et@@ ting systems , enforc@@ ement of guidelines on c@@ ash@@ -@@ delivery vehicles , and so on .
We are pro@@ ud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the back@@ lo@@ g in the er@@ ad@@ ication of the b@@ uc@@ ket system in established settl@@ ements by al@@ most half .
And we will ensure that decisions to exp@@ and the Cor@@ rec@@ tional Services infrastructure , improve the management of B@@ order Control as well as the imm@@ ig@@ ration and documentation services , among others , are implemented .
Many of the we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in improv@@ ing services to the population der@@ ive in part from in@@ adequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation .
We must act to change this situation .
Pe@@ ace and political st@@ ability are also centr@@ al to the governments efforts to create an en@@ abl@@ ing environment to encour@@ age investment Dec@@ isi@@ ve action will be taken to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate law@@ l@@ ess@@ ness , drug tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ king , gu@@ n run@@ ning , crime and especially the abuse of women and children .
Id@@ entif@@ y and implement specific interventions relevant to these hous@@ ehol@@ ds ;
Qu@@ ite clear@@ ly the regul@@ atory system that we have in place is in@@ adequate .
We will continue to con@@ front these challenges so as to er@@ ase in our country that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happ@@ iness that comes with lib@@ er@@ ty .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after the Mar@@ ch 200@@ 6 local government elections , ind@@ uc@@ tion programmes were conducted , taking into account that 6@@ 2 of the m@@ ay@@ ors are new .
Program@@ mes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue ap@@ ace .
We will under@@ take a c@@ are@@ ful review of the in@@ hib@@ iting fac@@ tors so that this programme is urg@@ ently spe@@ eded up .
These and many other initiatives form part of a com@@ prehensive pass@@ eng@@ er transport strategy , comb@@ in@@ ing both road and ra@@ il .
The mas@@ sive and sus@@ tained increase in cons@@ um@@ er dem@@ and refl@@ ects a heal@@ thy growth in levels of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity across the population ;
And given that a large majority of the un@@ employed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Y@@ outh Service and the development of young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
Ac@@ c@@ ess to electricity , water and s@@ an@@ itation has improved .
The fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ating M@@ atr@@ ic p@@ ass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stab@@ il@@ ise the system and ensure ste@@ ad@@ y improv@@ ement .
The programme to al@@ ign planning instrum@@ ents across the s@@ pher@@ es of government is continu@@ ing , with p@@ il@@ ot projects for complete al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment being ru@@ n in 1@@ 3 of our dis@@ tric@@ ts and met@@ ro@@ s .
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will em@@ er@@ ge as a result of the pe@@ er review process .
We should d@@ are to act in concer@@ t to pursu@@ e the happ@@ iness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .
We her@@ eb@@ y wish to pl@@ ed@@ ge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most est@@ e@@ em@@ ed of mul@@ til@@ ateral bod@@ ies , do every@@ thing necessary further to contribute to international peace and security .
Mad@@ ame Speaker , Chairperson and H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members ;
However , while we are fully jus@@ tified in celeb@@ r@@ ating the achiev@@ ements that Africa has made in her end@@ e@@ av@@ our to achieve peace and development , we cannot under@@ play the challenges that we face in dealing with the rem@@ aining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , C@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire and Som@@ alia .
One of the critical questions that we shall pursu@@ e in this regard is the spe@@ ed@@ y res@@ umption of the D@@ oh@@ a Development R@@ ound of W@@ T@@ O negoti@@ ations .
But no one , except our@@ selves , shall ensure that this dre@@ am is re@@ alised . We are not there yet .
This year the African Pe@@ er Rev@@ iew For@@ um will complete its review of our country .
In this regard we will also continue to eng@@ age the leaders of the peo@@ ples of Palest@@ ine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the M@@ id@@ dle East and the Per@@ si@@ an G@@ ul@@ f .
We shall also continue to streng@@ then our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in Indi@@ a , Br@@ az@@ il and the Pe@@ o@@ ples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as J@@ ap@@ an , E@@ u@@ rop@@ e and North Americ@@ a .
And so , let us rol@@ l up our s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and get down to work , fully under@@ standing that the task to build the South Africa for which we year@@ n is a common responsibility we all share .
We will continue to work with the sis@@ ter people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Com@@ or@@ os and Sudan in particular to ensure that the con@@ dition of peace and st@@ ability th@@ us far att@@ ained trans@@ l@@ ates without p@@ ause into concer@@ ted action for economic re@@ construction and social development .
We should today , even more conf@@ id@@ ently , speak together of freedom .
We should not and do not under@@ play the many difficul@@ ties we still con@@ front . Sin@@ ce the popul@@ ar m@@ and@@ ate of 200@@ 4 , we have made welcome progress in further chang@@ ing South Africa for the better .
Is@@ su@@ ed by : The Presid@@ ency Febru@@ ary 200@@ 7
We are conv@@ inc@@ ed that solutions to the log@@ j@@ ams currently being experi@@ enced can be found , and that it is in the long-@@ term interest of developed and developing countries al@@ ike that these tal@@ ks should re@@ ach fr@@ u@@ ition .
But the mess@@ age that our coll@@ ective experience communic@@ ates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succ@@ eed in meeting the common objective we have set our@@ selves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer cont@@ ains within it and re@@ present much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society .
Th@@ ank you .
Our government will respon@@ d appropri@@ ately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Som@@ alia .
Cr@@ itical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the prot@@ ag@@ on@@ ists within Som@@ alia inter@@ act with one another to find a s@@ olution that is in@@ clusive and prac@@ tic@@ able , based on the need to achieve national re@@ conciliation .
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legisl@@ ators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challeng@@ ing as it was un@@ ique for our young democracy .
S@@ imil@@ arly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to spe@@ ed up the implementation of the NE@@ PA@@ D programmes .
J@@ ust over a month ago , South Africa started its t@@ our of duty as a non-@@ permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
In Oc@@ t@@ ob@@ er another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 hous@@ ehol@@ ds will be sel@@ ected to participate in South Afric@@ as first national pan@@ el stud@@ y , the National In@@ come D@@ y@@ nam@@ ics St@@ ud@@ y .
rol@@ l out the B@@ ath@@ o P@@ ele campaign at local government level , int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y out@@ re@@ ach activities including izimb@@ izo and set up more multi@@ purpose Community C@@ ent@@ res bey@@ ond the 90 currently oper@@ ational ;
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y out@@ re@@ ach and aw@@ ar@@ eness on issues of national sp@@ ati@@ al development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the har@@ mon@@ isation of planning instrum@@ ents across the three s@@ pher@@ es ; conduct capacity assess@@ ments and implement interventions in Provincial De@@ part@@ ments responsible for local government , as well as the Off@@ ices of the Premi@@ ers , while continu@@ ing to improve the capacity of our national departments ;
further capac@@ it@@ ate and provide more support to the institution of traditional lead@@ ership .
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year :
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant nor@@ ms and standards , rem@@ uneration policy and matters per@@ taining to medical aid and p@@ ensi@@ ons ;
As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Stat@@ istics South Africa have g@@ one out across our country to coll@@ ect information on 2@@ 8@@ 0 000 hous@@ ehol@@ ds ch@@ os@@ en to participate in a Community Sur@@ v@@ ey , which will give government as acc@@ ur@@ ate as possible a s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country .
streng@@ then monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the s@@ pher@@ es , including training of manag@@ ers responsible for the implementation of this system ;
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those sel@@ ected to co@@ operate fully in these important under@@ tak@@ ings .
Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson :
We are pro@@ ud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in hel@@ ping to bring this about from the young men and women in our National D@@ ef@@ ence For@@ ce to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dre@@ am f@@ ind@@ s prac@@ tical re@@ alisation in the hom@@ el@@ and of P@@ atr@@ ice L@@ um@@ umba . Am@@ ong the gre@@ at@@ est achiev@@ ements of the peo@@ ples of Africa in the past tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ half years has been the restor@@ ation of peace in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es Reg@@ ion .
Improv@@ ing govern@@ ance also means having a sound stat@@ istical database about social d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics within our nation .
In this regard , two major surv@@ ey@@ s will be undertaken in 200@@ 7 .
These 30 000 individuals will be tr@@ acked over time , to further our under@@ standing of such issues such as m@@ ig@@ ration , labour market transi@@ tions , inter@@ -@@ gener@@ ational mob@@ ility and household formation and dis@@ s@@ olution .
while int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ying the public sector and national an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effec@@ tiveness of our an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption strateg@@ ies for all s@@ pher@@ es of government ;
In this regard , we are hear@@ t@@ ened by the res@@ olve sh@@ own by leaders of the business and religious communities further to streng@@ then such part@@ nerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to streng@@ then the fight against crime .
util@@ ise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and gener@@ ally improve management of the courts and the pro@@ secu@@ tion service , in order mas@@ si@@ vely to reduce case back@@ log@@ s ;
continue with the processes further to capac@@ it@@ ate our intell@@ igence ag@@ encies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ;
Fur@@ ther to improve its service to the people , government should op@@ tim@@ ise its capacity and organis@@ ational effici@@ ency .
fin@@ alise rem@@ aining el@@ ements of measures to trans@@ form the jud@@ ici@@ ary and improve its func@@ tion@@ ing , in consultation with this em@@ in@@ ent institution of our democracy ;
improve our analys@@ is of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime comb@@ ating .
In this regard , we must respon@@ d to the col@@ d re@@ ality that , as in other countries , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing majority of viol@@ ent crimes against the person occ@@ ur in the most soci@@ o-@@ econom@@ ically de@@ priv@@ ed areas of our country and require strong and sus@@ tained community interventions foc@@ used on crime prevention .
Government will play its part to ensure that these part@@ nerships ac@@ tually work , and that we all act together to dis@@ charge the responsibility to protect our citizens .
I should m@@ ention in this regard that the Minis@@ try of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on pro@@ pos@@ als further to improve the func@@ tion@@ ing and effec@@ tiveness of the v@@ it@@ ally important Community Police For@@ ums .
As we have already said , these and other measures will succ@@ eed only if we build an end@@ uring partnership in ac@@ tual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficul@@ t for the crimin@@ als .
implement the programmes decided upon to build more correc@@ tions facilities and re@@ alise the objectives of the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on Cor@@ rec@@ tions ;
implement the recommendations of the Kh@@ amp@@ ep@@ e Commission on the m@@ and@@ ate and operations of the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations ;
ens@@ uring the implementation , without further del@@ ay , of measures to reduce the cost of med@@ ic@@ ines ;
start the process of further moder@@ n@@ ising the systems of the South African Revenue Services , especially in respect of b@@ order control , and improve the work of the inter@@ depart@@ mental coordin@@ ating structures in this regard ;
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y intell@@ igence work with regard to organised crime , building on the succ@@ esses that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with c@@ ash@@ -@@ in-@@ transi@@ t he@@ ists , drug tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ king and po@@ aching of g@@ ame and abal@@ one ;
spe@@ eding up the implementation of the tax@@ i rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation project , implementing det@@ ailed plans for pass@@ eng@@ er ra@@ il and road transport including the B@@ us R@@ ap@@ id Tr@@ ansi@@ t System in the M@@ etro@@ s and rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of Me@@ tr@@ or@@ ail : and in this regard , let me take this opportunity to emphas@@ ise that government and our partners in SA@@ N@@ T@@ A@@ C@@ O will not be bul@@ li@@ ed into aband@@ oning the tax@@ i rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation project , and any attemp@@ ts to under@@ mine public order in pursu@@ it of sel@@ fish interests will be deal@@ t with accord@@ ingly ;
continue to improve the rem@@ uneration and working conditions of the police , and start the process of further exp@@ and@@ ing the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 1@@ 8@@ 0 000 within three years , and ensure op@@ tim@@ al util@@ isation of the electron@@ ic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduc@@ ed ;
What we should under@@ line though is that in fin@@ ishing the new social security disp@@ ensation , government will under@@ take a com@@ prehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individ@@ ually and through NE@@ D@@ L@@ A@@ C .
In addition , we have also started exam@@ in@@ ing measures to re@@ ach vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 years .
This year we shall complete con@@ cre@@ te plans on implementation of the final st@@ ages of our programmes to meet the targ@@ ets for univ@@ ers@@ al access to water in 200@@ 8 , s@@ an@@ itation in 20@@ 10 and electricity in 20@@ 12 .
a social security tax to fin@@ ance basic re@@ ti@@ r@@ ement s@@ av@@ ings , death , dis@@ ability and un@@ employment benefits .
The Minister of Fin@@ ance will further el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on these issues in the B@@ ud@@ get Spe@@ ech .
contin@@ uation of the minimum benefits cont@@ ained in our social gr@@ ants system with the benefits paid through a moder@@ n administrative system ;
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by f@@ illing vac@@ ant pos@@ ts , improv@@ ing systems and implementing other recommendations of the T@@ ask Te@@ am that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this v@@ ital institution ;
continu@@ ing with the implementation of the rem@@ uneration disp@@ ensation for medical profes@@ sion@@ als , and providing additional resources further to improve the rem@@ uneration levels of teach@@ ers ;
a w@@ age subsid@@ y for low@@ -@@ w@@ age employees , possib@@ ly direc@@ ted at first entr@@ ants into the job market , especially young people ;
The challenge that we face in addres@@ sing this issue has little to do with policies .
We shall ensure that the part@@ nerships bu@@ ilt over the years are strength@@ ened , and that our improved national com@@ prehensive strategy against A@@ ID@@ S and sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted inf@@ ections is fin@@ alised as soon as possible .
All these efforts , Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sus@@ tained drive to improve community safety and security .
R@@ ather , what is required is effective organisation , mobil@@ isation and lead@@ ership of the m@@ ass of law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement , intell@@ igence and correc@@ tions officers , and func@@ tion@@ aries of the justice system .
exp@@ and@@ ing access to E@@ arly Ch@@ ild@@ h@@ ood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme ;
In addition to the many ong@@ oing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year :
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include :
spe@@ eding up of the construction of low@@ -@@ cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special P@@ ur@@ pose V@@ ehic@@ le to h@@ andle fin@@ ances , p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing of the Land U@@ se Management Bill and ens@@ uring that the rem@@ aining el@@ ements of the mu@@ ch@@ -@@ del@@ ay@@ ed agreement with the private sector on low@@ -@@ cost housing are fin@@ alised ;
In this regard , government comm@@ its itself to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the campaign against HIV and A@@ ID@@ S and to improve its implementation of all el@@ ements of the com@@ prehensive approach such as prevention , hom@@ e-@@ based care and treatment .
bring to full capacity the for@@ ensic labor@@ at@@ ories which have been equip@@ ped with the lat@@ est technology , and ensure the op@@ tim@@ um util@@ isation of the finger@@ print database ind@@ eed , many of the recent succ@@ esses in s@@ olv@@ ing serious crime incidents have been facilit@@ ated by these systems ;
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing majority of these public serv@@ ants have prov@@ en over and over again in ac@@ tual practice that they are prepar@@ ed to put their lives on the line and to s@@ ac@@ r@@ if@@ ice even the little quality time they could have with their fam@@ il@@ ies , in defence of our freedom and our security .
exp@@ and@@ ing training and employment of nur@@ ses and social workers as well as au@@ x@@ ili@@ aries , increasing the number of training institutions , improv@@ ing the quality of training , and institu@@ ting a bur@@ s@@ ary system ;
In the discus@@ sions th@@ us far conducted within government , cons@@ ensu@@ s is emerg@@ ing that el@@ ements of this system would need to include :
continu@@ ing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural causes of death in our society as well as lif@@ est@@ y@@ le dis@@ eases , mal@@ ar@@ ia , the various str@@ ains of T@@ B , road acc@@ id@@ ents and viol@@ ent crime .
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strength@@ ening our fight against crime are effec@@ tively implemented .
This will me@@ an that all South Africans will en@@ jo@@ y memb@@ ership of a common , administr@@ atively efficient social in@@ sur@@ ance system , while those ear@@ ning high@@ er in@@ comes will be able to continue contribu@@ ting to private re@@ ti@@ r@@ ement and in@@ sur@@ ance sch@@ em@@ es .
We shall also fin@@ alise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on , including the com@@ prehensive and integrated anti-@@ poverty strategy we have mentioned , as well as address issues per@@ taining to national unity , value systems and identity .
For us it is not a m@@ ere cl@@ ich to ass@@ ert that the success of our democracy should and will be meas@@ ured by the con@@ cre@@ te steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vul@@ ner@@ able in our society .
In addition , Tel@@ k@@ om will apply a special low rate for international b@@ and@@ wid@@ th to 10 development call cent@@ res each employ@@ ing 1@@ 000 persons , as part of the effort to exp@@ and the B@@ P@@ O sector . These cent@@ res will be established in areas identified by government .
take further prac@@ tical action to improve access to mic@@ ro@@ -@@ fin@@ ance including the re@@ ach of the A@@ pe@@ x Fund and the agricultural mic@@ ro@@ -@@ credit fund ; ensure the proper func@@ tion@@ ing of the S@@ m@@ all En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises Development Ag@@ ency , S@@ E@@ D@@ A ;
having sur@@ passed the 10 000 targ@@ et we set our@@ selves , we will increase the number of young people eng@@ aged in the National Y@@ outh Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , en@@ rol 30 000 young volun@@ te@@ ers in community development initiatives , and em@@ pl@@ o@@ y 5 000 young people as part of the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme in the maintenance of government build@@ ings ;
This is that the contr@@ ib@@ ut@@ ory ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related p@@ ill@@ ar of our social security system is mis@@ sing or un@@ rel@@ i@@ able for large numbers of working people .
In carr@@ ying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 20@@ 10 F@@ IF@@ A World Cup is the best ever .
We wish in this regard to congratul@@ ate our Local Organis@@ ing Committee and other partners for the st@@ er@@ ling work they are doing .
With regard to min@@ eral benefici@@ ation for inst@@ ance , we will set up a State Di@@ am@@ ond Tr@@ ad@@ er that will purch@@ ase 10 of di@@ am@@ ond@@ s from local produc@@ ers and sel@@ l them to local c@@ ut@@ ters and produc@@ ers .
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods .
Qu@@ ite clear@@ ly , in order to ensure that all South Africans en@@ jo@@ y the happ@@ iness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an int@@ ensi@@ fied programme to address challenges in the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y .
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y efforts to integr@@ ate youth development into the main@@ stre@@ am of government work , including a youth co@@ oper@@ atives programme , and the ong@@ oing efforts to link un@@ employed gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates with employment opportunities and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , bi@@ g and small , which have respond@@ ed in a s@@ pl@@ end@@ id and prac@@ tical manner to this initi@@ ative ;
In this regard , we wish to comm@@ end the role played by the Jo@@ int In@@ iti@@ ative on S@@ k@@ ills Ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion , which br@@ ings together government , business , labour , training institu@@ tes and others .
start implementing the Comm@@ un@@ al Land Rights Act in order to improve economic util@@ isation of commun@@ al land , while at the same time exp@@ and@@ ing assistance such as ir@@ rig@@ ation , se@@ eds and impl@@ ements to small and co@@ oper@@ ative farm@@ ers .
We will also take a variety of steps to improve competi@@ tion in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including prac@@ tical introduc@@ tion of the Reg@@ ul@@ atory Imp@@ act Ass@@ ess@@ ment system , developing high-@@ spe@@ ed national and international broad@@ band capacity , fin@@ alis@@ ing the plan to improve the capacity of the ra@@ il and port oper@@ ators , and strength@@ ening the effec@@ tiveness of our competi@@ tion authorities .
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the mess@@ age especially to our young people , that art@@ is@@ an skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualif@@ ication .
process the Companies Bill , adopted for public com@@ ment by Cabinet last W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , as part of the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y of measures to reduce the regul@@ atory bur@@ den on small , medi@@ um and mic@@ ro@@ -@@ enterprises and to empow@@ er min@@ ority shar@@ eholders and employees ;
We are happ@@ y that De@@ Be@@ ers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and as@@ set provision for a period of three years ;
St@@ ar@@ ting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to tr@@ ain@@ ees in need , who ent@@ er these institutions .
B@@ ec@@ ause of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things :
The special rate will be directly compar@@ able to those for the same service and capacity per month off@@ ered in any of the compar@@ able countries .
A critical part of this re@@ form will be the task of rep@@ air@@ ing a def@@ ect identified in the 200@@ 2 Report of the Committee of In@@ quir@@ y into a Com@@ prehensive System of Social Security in South Africa .
develop programmes to facilitate invest@@ ments in sectors along the supply ch@@ ain for our infrastructure programmes , including capital goods in IC@@ T , transport and energy : with regard to energy , we will also exp@@ ed@@ ite our work to ensure gre@@ ater rel@@ iance on nuclear power gener@@ ation , natural gas and the various forms of renew@@ able sour@@ ces of energy .
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members know , we have also signific@@ antly increas@@ ed the number of non-@@ fee pay@@ ing schools .
With regard to communic@@ ations , I am pl@@ eased to anno@@ un@@ ce that the Department of Communic@@ ations together with the mob@@ ile teleph@@ one companies and Tel@@ k@@ om are fin@@ alis@@ ing plans to address call ter@@ min@@ ation rates this year for the benefit of all cons@@ um@@ ers .
The progress we have made with regard to the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of Fur@@ ther Education and Training Col@@ leg@@ es has created the possib@@ ility for us signific@@ antly to exp@@ and the number of available art@@ is@@ ans .
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , we aim this year to complete the work already started to re@@ form our system of social security so that ph@@ ased implementation can start as early as possible .
The princi@@ ple guid@@ ing this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explor@@ e the introduc@@ tion of an ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related contr@@ ib@@ ut@@ ory social security system that is informed by the princi@@ ple of social sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity .
After int@@ ense inter@@ action between government and leaders of our univ@@ er@@ si@@ ties , agreement has been re@@ ached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided .
At the same time , we shall urg@@ ently res@@ olve the issue of responsib@@ ilities between the national and provincial s@@ pher@@ es in the management of the F@@ ET system .
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y implementation of custom@@ ised sector measures to facilitate invest@@ ments in B@@ us@@ iness Pro@@ c@@ ess O@@ ut@@ sour@@ c@@ ing , tourism , bi@@ o-@@ fu@@ els and chem@@ ic@@ als , and fin@@ alise prac@@ tical programmes for for@@ es@@ try and paper , clo@@ thing and t@@ ex@@ til@@ es , met@@ als and engine@@ ering ;
develop an over@@ arch@@ ing strategy to prior@@ it@@ ise key interventions in mining and min@@ eral benefici@@ ation , agr@@ iculture and ag@@ ro@@ -@@ processing , the white goods sector , cre@@ ative indus@@ tries , community and social services and ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ e@@ u@@ tic@@ als .
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted drive in which all of South Africa should eng@@ age in order to reduce the levels of poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality in our society .
What she expec@@ ts as her bir@@ th@@ day present is the tr@@ uth .
further strength@@ ening the mach@@ in@@ ery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respon@@ d to our development im@@ per@@ atives and ,
enh@@ anc@@ ing the impact of our programmes targ@@ eting the cr@@ itic@@ ally important area of education and training
G@@ iven that we are appro@@ aching the end of our m@@ and@@ ate term , the Government decided that it should identify a su@@ ite of A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities on which it must focus in a special way , using these as cat@@ al@@ ys@@ ts further to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate progress towards the achiev@@ ement of the objectives the people m@@ and@@ ated us to pursu@@ e .
This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to conv@@ ey to the country the ap@@ ologies of both the Government and E@@ sk@@ om for the national emergency which has resul@@ ted in all of us having to cont@@ end with the consequ@@ ences of load sh@@ ed@@ ding .
They are wor@@ r@@ ied about whether we have the capacity to def@@ end the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were b@@ orn of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous s@@ ac@@ r@@ if@@ ices .
acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ ement of the go@@ al of health for all
I thank her for taking the tro@@ ub@@ le to be with us today , and trust that we will not dis@@ appoin@@ t her .
M@@ y answ@@ er to this question is a defin@@ ite No !
And so I qu@@ ote these words :
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the N@@ C@@ O@@ P ;
We acknow@@ ledge , both among the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members and our gu@@ ests , the many fo@@ und@@ ers of the United D@@ em@@ oc@@ ratic Fr@@ on@@ t , 2@@ 5 years ago .
I would also like to take this opportunity to sal@@ ute President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , one of the pre-@@ em@@ in@@ ent fo@@ unding f@@ ath@@ ers of our democracy , who will mark his 9@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day on 18 Jul@@ y this year .
Mor@@ e than at any other time , the situation that con@@ fron@@ ts our nation and country , and the t@@ as@@ ks we have set our@@ selves , dem@@ and that we in@@ spir@@ e and organ@@ ise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , under@@ standing that in a very re@@ al s@@ ense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hand@@ s !
All these hon@@ our@@ ed gu@@ ests , represent@@ ing both m@@ em@@ ory and hope , rem@@ ind us by their presence that ours is a task in a rel@@ ay r@@ ace of continu@@ ous re@@ birth so that the dre@@ am of a better life becomes a re@@ ality for all South Africans .
As we act together every@@ where in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual !
In@@ deed , they re@@ present a celeb@@ ration of the ind@@ om@@ itable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not be@@ tr@@ ay or dis@@ appoin@@ t the expec@@ t@@ ations of the people .
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ gy and Public En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises have out@@ lin@@ ed the nature of the emergency we con@@ front and what each one of us can do to norm@@ alise the situation .
In this situation , we have to cur@@ ta@@ il the un@@ plan@@ ned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce dem@@ and and th@@ us ensure a better res@@ erve marg@@ in .
I am pl@@ eased to say that we have ind@@ eed done much to implement the commit@@ ments we made to the people in 200@@ 4 .
I would also like to thank all citizens for their res@@ ili@@ ence and for@@ be@@ aring in the face of the current difficul@@ ties .
The main categories of these prior@@ ities are :
Wh@@ ile they recogn@@ ise and respect the right of the r@@ ul@@ ing party to regul@@ ate its own aff@@ airs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the prin@@ cip@@ al arch@@ it@@ ects of a democratic , non@@ racial , n@@ ons@@ ex@@ ist and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous South Africa .
Chairperson of SA@@ L@@ G@@ A , m@@ ay@@ ors and leaders in our system of local government ;
There are con@@ cre@@ te actions each individual , household and business can take .
Al@@ low me on this occas@@ ion of the p@@ en@@ ul@@ tim@@ ate Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the third Parliament for the annual deb@@ ate on the state of our nation , to wish all the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members of Parliament a happ@@ y and produc@@ tive New Y@@ e@@ ar .
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our hon@@ our@@ ed traditional leaders ;
They are concerned about some develop@@ ments in our economy , especially the ste@@ ad@@ y increase in interest rates , food and fu@@ el pr@@ ices which further imp@@ over@@ ish especially the poor .
enh@@ anc@@ ing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and Sou@@ th-@@ South relations .
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic par@@ liam@@ ent and government soon after which we will hold our f@@ our@@ th general elections .
This must say to all of us that we are ind@@ eed in a period of challenges , but sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table challenges .
On the supply side E@@ sk@@ om is working fur@@ i@@ ously to ensure the introduc@@ tion of co-@@ gener@@ ation projects as a matter of urg@@ ency .
The national emergency represented by the current power out@@ ages pos@@ es the challenge and presents the opportunity to the enti@@ re@@ ty of our nation to give con@@ cre@@ te expres@@ sion to the call we have just made for all of us to un@@ ite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course .
To make certain that this happ@@ ens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Ann@@ ual B@@ ud@@ get the Minister of Fin@@ ance will present later this month makes the necessary al@@ loc@@ ations to give us the means to implement the A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities .
He sugg@@ ested that this morning , to cap@@ ture what he consid@@ ers the ess@@ ence of the re@@ ality con@@ fron@@ ting us , I should rec@@ all the well-@@ known words with which Char@@ les D@@ ick@@ ens opened his nov@@ el , A T@@ ale of Two C@@ ities .
You will ask whether I ag@@ ree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of conf@@ us@@ ion , in which all of us cannot but l@@ ose our way , un@@ sure of our steps , un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y on our fe@@ et , f@@ ear@@ ful of the future !
the further acc@@ el@@ eration of our economic growth and development
In ess@@ ence the significant r@@ ise in electricity dem@@ and over the last two years has out@@ str@@ ip@@ ped the new capacity we have b@@ roug@@ ht on stre@@ am .
But if all of us can for@@ ge strong part@@ nerships to t@@ ack@@ le the situation , we will all come through I hope rel@@ atively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed This is not a time for fing@@ er point@@ ing , but for working together in f@@ inding solutions .
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proc@@ eed as we keep our ey@@ es firm@@ ly foc@@ used on the continued pursu@@ it of the go@@ al of a better life for all our people .
L@@ ast week the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members had an opportunity to refl@@ ect on these matters .
State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress of the President of South Africa , Th@@ abo Mb@@ eki : Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament Febru@@ ary 200@@ 8
I say this because , in our own esti@@ m@@ ation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to str@@ ain every sin@@ ew of its coll@@ ective body to att@@ ain a dre@@ am .
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members know , she said : I don@@ t regard the problems of energy supply here as a dis@@ aster . And South Africa is not al@@ one : there are pres@@ su@@ res on supply regarding our exp@@ an@@ sion projects in Ch@@ ile and Br@@ az@@ il .
S@@ ure , the problems here are serious ; over@@ coming them will require ingen@@ u@@ ity , especially in energy effici@@ ency and energy s@@ aving , as well as the development of altern@@ ative power suppl@@ ies .
The details of other volunt@@ ary and m@@ and@@ atory actions in the P@@ ow@@ er Con@@ serv@@ ation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be re@@ fin@@ ed through consultation with the various stak@@ eholders and then published .
The id@@ entification of the A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities means that all three s@@ pher@@ es of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are her@@ eb@@ y making the firm under@@ taking that we will use the short period ah@@ e@@ ad of us further to ener@@ g@@ ise our adv@@ ance towards the re@@ alisation of the all@@ -@@ important go@@ al of a better life for all our people .
We welcome to this occas@@ ion Mr Ar@@ th@@ ur M@@ arg@@ em@@ an , represent@@ ing the v@@ eter@@ ans of the Al@@ ex@@ and@@ r@@ a bu@@ s b@@ oy@@ co@@ t@@ t of f@@ if@@ ty years ago , who include N@@ el@@ son Mandela .
These are being dis@@ sem@@ inated by the Department of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ gy and we remain open to any other sugg@@ es@@ tions that you , our comp@@ atr@@ i@@ o@@ ts , may give to us and share with one another .
As I was prepar@@ ing this Add@@ ress , one among us sugg@@ ested to me that our country was being bu@@ ff@@ eted by strong cros@@ sw@@ ind@@ s that made it especially difficul@@ t to for@@ es@@ ee where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
We are also priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed to have among us Ms J@@ an@@ n T@@ ur@@ ner , the d@@ a@@ ugh@@ ter of R@@ ick T@@ ur@@ ner who was mur@@ d@@ ered by apartheid ag@@ ents 30 years ago .
Let me therefore make b@@ old to say that this histor@@ ical mom@@ ent dem@@ ands that our nation should un@@ ite as never before and str@@ ain every sin@@ ew of its coll@@ ective body to address our common challenges and keep al@@ ive the dre@@ am that has sus@@ tained all of us as we travell@@ ed along the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the cre@@ ation of the South Africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our Constitution .
Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient l@@ ighting , sol@@ ar water he@@ ating and g@@ ey@@ s@@ er load management in hous@@ ehol@@ ds , including housing standards for all new houses and develop@@ ments .
The resul@@ t@@ ant ti@@ g@@ ht supply situation makes the over@@ all system vul@@ ner@@ able to any incid@@ ent aff@@ ecting the avail@@ ability of energy .
improv@@ ing the effec@@ tiveness of our interventions direc@@ ted at the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y , and poverty er@@ ad@@ ication
And such is the inj@@ unc@@ tion that history has im@@ posed on us today .
rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y our off@@ ensive against crime
As government our task is to now lead and un@@ ite the country behind a campaign for energy effici@@ ency that will address this challenge .
The re@@ al challenge is to respon@@ d to them in a manner that conv@@ ey@@ s the defin@@ ite mess@@ age to every@@ body in our country and the mil@@ li@@ ons in Africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world who wat@@ ch our country with ke@@ en interest , that we remain firm in our res@@ olve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people , but also to many others outside our b@@ orders .
In this regard , I would like to expres@@ s our appreci@@ ation and full agreement with the comm@@ ents made by the Chief Executive of Ang@@ lo Americ@@ an , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia C@@ arr@@ ol@@ l , when she addres@@ sed the Min@@ ing Ind@@ aba here in Cape Town ear@@ lier this week , on T@@ u@@ es@@ day , Febru@@ ary 5 .
It was the best of times , it was the wor@@ st of times , it was the age of w@@ is@@ d@@ om , it was the age of fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness , it was the ep@@ oc@@ h of bel@@ ief , it was the ep@@ oc@@ h of inc@@ red@@ ul@@ ity , it was the season of L@@ ight , it was the season of D@@ ar@@ k@@ ness , it was the spr@@ ing of hope , it was the w@@ int@@ er of des@@ p@@ air , we had every@@ thing before us , we had noth@@ ing before us , we were all going direct to He@@ av@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est authorities in@@ sis@@ ted on its being received , for good or for ev@@ il , in the super@@ l@@ ative d@@ eg@@ ree of compar@@ is@@ on only .
Am@@ ong other things , we must use the current adv@@ ersity to ensure that our hom@@ es and economy become more energy efficient .
Th@@ us should we all re@@ affirm that we remain on course as we continue to str@@ ive to make ours a w@@ inning nation .
And prec@@ is@@ ely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity !
We ur@@ ge hous@@ ehol@@ ds that can affor@@ d to act immediately to consider implementing these ener@@ g@@ y-@@ s@@ aving measures .
I speak here today in the presence of my m@@ other , E@@ pain@@ ette Mb@@ eki , Ma@@ M@@ of@@ ok@@ eng , who came to communic@@ ate an un@@ equ@@ iv@@ ocal mess@@ age from the rural m@@ asses of the Trans@@ ke@@ i , among whom she has l@@ ived for many dec@@ ades .
They are wor@@ r@@ ied about whether our country is threat@@ ened by the an@@ arch@@ y represented by the criminal tor@@ ching of six pass@@ eng@@ er tr@@ ains in Tsh@@ wane last month .
We speak of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual not refer@@ ring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the spe@@ ed@@ y , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , so@@ on@@ er rather than later .
She says these m@@ asses dem@@ and of all of us who cl@@ aim to be their leaders , that we t@@ ell them and others like them el@@ se@@ where in our country , whether we remain committed to the under@@ taking we have made that t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w will be better than today .
In eight days time , on Febru@@ ary 16 , she will be 9@@ 2 years old .
This is driven by such develop@@ ments as the pro@@ secu@@ tion of the National Commissioner of Police , the susp@@ ension of the National Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions , f@@ ear@@ s about a threat to the indep@@ end@@ ence of the jud@@ ici@@ ary and the r@@ ule of law , and the att@@ end@@ ant alleg@@ ations about the abuse of state power for political purposes .
We are also pl@@ eased that we have among us Mr D@@ in@@ il@@ es@@ izwe S@@ ob@@ ukw@@ e , son of the outstanding pat@@ ri@@ ot and leader , Rob@@ ert S@@ ob@@ ukw@@ e , who also passed away 30 years back after end@@ uring many years of im@@ prison@@ ment , ban@@ ishment and other forms of re@@ pres@@ sion .
L@@ ike the rest of our Government I am conv@@ inc@@ ed that the fundam@@ ent@@ als that have informed our countr@@ y@@ s forward mar@@ ch in the last 14 years remain in place .
An instruc@@ tion has been issued for all government build@@ ings to reduce their cons@@ umption of electricity and please fe@@ el free to name and sh@@ ame those who do not .
spe@@ eding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social go@@ als
The enti@@ re@@ ty of our system of govern@@ ance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ah@@ e@@ ad of us , it will do its best to live up to the im@@ per@@ ative B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual !
I am conf@@ ident that 200@@ 8 will be one of the most remar@@ k@@ able years of our democracy , as we all work together to re@@ alise the cor@@ e as@@ pir@@ ation of our people to att@@ ain a better life for all .
Some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic rec@@ es@@ sion in the United States .
Mr J@@ ac@@ o@@ b Z@@ uma , For@@ m@@ er Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Cong@@ ress ;
However , and not un@@ expec@@ te@@ dly , it is ob@@ vi@@ ous that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard .
The Government has therefore re@@ view@@ ed the dist@@ ance we have travell@@ ed in terms of implementing the m@@ and@@ ate given by the people in 200@@ 4 .
However , like all the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are tro@@ ubl@@ ed by a de@@ ep s@@ ense of un@@ ease about where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
H@@ app@@ ily , this State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress has given me the possib@@ ility to report to Parliament and the N@@ ation on our 24 A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities which , the H@@ on Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week .
M@@ ost ob@@ vi@@ ously it would be ir@@ responsible to ig@@ nor@@ e these and other concer@@ ns or dis@@ mis@@ s them as m@@ ere j@@ er@@ emi@@ ads typ@@ ical of the pro@@ ph@@ ets of d@@ oo@@ m .
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targ@@ ets we have set our@@ selves .
The s@@ ense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further af@@ i@@ eld , represented by the ac@@ tual d@@ ail@@ y progress we are making in terms of our all@@ -@@ ro@@ und prepar@@ ations , is one of - B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual : all hand@@ s on dec@@ k for 20@@ 10 !
We have emergency task te@@ ams dealing with the challenge of co@@ al quality and supply with the co@@ al mining industry and we are working to f@@ ast tr@@ ack the approval and construction of gas tur@@ b@@ ine projects .
This situation has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the in@@ ev@@ itable re@@ alisation that the era of very ch@@ e@@ ap and ab@@ und@@ ant electricity has come to an end .
Fur@@ ther , after correc@@ ting we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in our Ad@@ ul@@ t Bas@@ ic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month laun@@ ch the Kh@@ a R@@ i G@@ ude m@@ ass lit@@ er@@ acy campaign .
We must therefore continue to support the mining industry .
Wor@@ king with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to laun@@ ch the under@@ se@@ a c@@ ables .
However it is im@@ per@@ ative that all enterprises become more energy efficient .
I am certain that the South African F@@ o@@ ot@@ b@@ all Association , our co@@ aches led by Car@@ lo@@ s Al@@ ber@@ to Par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , and the players are aware of the heav@@ y responsibility they carr@@ y to pre@@ p@@ are a national team of which both we and Africa should be pro@@ ud .
the B@@ ud@@ get will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equ@@ alis@@ ing the age of elig@@ ib@@ ility at 60 , th@@ us benef@@ iting about half a mil@@ lion men ;
Wor@@ k to review the National Hum@@ an Resour@@ ce Development Strateg@@ y will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academ@@ ic institutions organised under the Jo@@ int In@@ iti@@ ative on Pr@@ i@@ ority S@@ k@@ ills Ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion will be int@@ ensi@@ fied .
This ent@@ ails coordin@@ ating the programmes of the Stat@@ e-@@ owned En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises and over@@ lay@@ ing all the infrastructure plans , including fre@@ ight and other log@@ istics , energy pip@@ elines , information and communic@@ ations technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their tim@@ ing and geograph@@ ic location .
In@@ deed , energy effici@@ ency itself provides economic opportunity .
At the m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic level , we will continue to maintain a f@@ isc@@ al pos@@ ture that suppor@@ ts continued economic growth and development and reduc@@ ing our ex@@ tern@@ al vul@@ ner@@ ability .
Let me now tur@@ n to the A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities I mentioned .
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the B@@ ills on the trans@@ formation of the jud@@ ici@@ ary in consultation with jud@@ ges and m@@ agistr@@ ates , complete the strategy aimed at strength@@ ening b@@ order control and security , further give life to the Vic@@ ti@@ ms Char@@ ter , pay particular attention to the issue of repe@@ at off@@ end@@ ers , and continue the implementation of additional measures der@@ iving from recommendations of the Tr@@ uth and Rec@@ on@@ c@@ iliation Commission .
We are fully aware that a critical el@@ ement of our prepar@@ ations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the foot@@ b@@ all fr@@ ater@@ nity pro@@ ud .
Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ying efforts already started to scale up assistance to co@@ oper@@ atives and small enterprises especially those involv@@ ing women , with emphas@@ is on providing training and mar@@ kets , including link@@ ing them up with established out@@ le@@ ts ;
We shall this year attend to other specific prior@@ ities which are critical to the countr@@ y@@ s war against poverty , in pursu@@ it of soci@@ o@@ economic in@@ clus@@ ion .
Y@@ et another critical A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ ority is the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of an integrated and com@@ prehensive anti-@@ poverty strategy that addres@@ ses especially sections of the population most affected by this s@@ cour@@ ge .
Al@@ ong with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions foc@@ used on poverty reduc@@ tion , we continue to address a number many we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses , including the processing of the Land U@@ se Management Bill , the fin@@ alisation of the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion cases , the support programme for those who ac@@ quir@@ e land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme .
Wor@@ king together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urg@@ ently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not ex@@ ist , such as mining and min@@ er@@ als benefici@@ ation , cons@@ um@@ er d@@ ur@@ ables , re@@ ta@@ il with a focus on improv@@ ing support to small enterprises , construction , the cre@@ ative indus@@ tries , agr@@ iculture and ag@@ ro@@ -@@ processing .
We will laun@@ ch this sy@@ n@@ ch@@ r@@ on@@ ised process soon , guid@@ ed by the South African Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Nam@@ es Council and its provincial committees .
Government will continue our indus@@ tri@@ alisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson , When we refl@@ ected on the issue of crime at last years Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament , we all expres@@ sed gr@@ ave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the ind@@ ication that things se@@ em@@ ed to be tur@@ ning for the wor@@ se especially in respect of murder b@@ uc@@ king the tr@@ end of the improv@@ ement since the att@@ ain@@ ment of democracy .
We will all work to minim@@ ise the adv@@ erse impact these events had on the industry .
However , given our large base of install@@ ed gener@@ ation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain am@@ ong@@ st the few economies with affor@@ d@@ able electricity .
The second issue is about geograph@@ ic and place names , which requires a sy@@ n@@ ch@@ r@@ on@@ ised process across all provinces so we can create a base sl@@ ate of changes we pro@@ pose .
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is hel@@ ping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weap@@ on in our W@@ ar on P@@ overty and acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the att@@ ain@@ ment of such objectives as the reduc@@ tion of un@@ employment and adv@@ anc@@ ing the go@@ al of health for all .
We will also integr@@ ate the programme to spe@@ ed up the development of sustainable human settl@@ ements , with int@@ ensi@@ fied efforts , as a matter of urgent pri@@ ority , to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate univ@@ ers@@ al access to water , s@@ an@@ itation and electricity , so that by 20@@ 14 , we should have dec@@ ent human settl@@ ements and access by all hous@@ ehol@@ ds to these services .
Am@@ ong the key proposed interventions are : exp@@ and@@ ing the public works programme , employment subsid@@ ies for direct j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation for targeted groups , enh@@ anc@@ ing employment se@@ arch cap@@ ability , improv@@ ing education and training , improv@@ ing services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor hous@@ ehol@@ ds , and ens@@ uring effec@@ tiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors .
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and compl@@ ement@@ ary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime .
Accord@@ ingly , we will this year complete the licens@@ ing and oper@@ ation@@ alisation of In@@ fr@@ ac@@ o .
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Pre@@ vention and Security Cl@@ us@@ ter will el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week .
N@@ ext week the Provincial Premi@@ ers will conv@@ ene their for@@ a with m@@ ay@@ ors to plan and implement the energy s@@ aving measures in all the municipalities across the country .
Accord@@ ingly , last year we eng@@ aged in syst@@ em@@ atic inter@@ action with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a hol@@ istic approach towards rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system in its tot@@ ality .
At the same time , we aim to provide dig@@ ital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year .
H@@ aving no@@ ted that the t@@ ard@@ iness with which government processes applications for investment in rel@@ ation to issues such as land ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion , infrastructure and environmental impact assess@@ ments can at times make or bre@@ ak invest@@ or decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual , work is progres@@ sing urg@@ ently to set up a call centre through which prospec@@ tive invest@@ ors and government can tr@@ ack these processes .
Col@@ l@@ ective effort and consultation are at the centre of our respon@@ se to the emergency .
As we put all our hand@@ s on dec@@ k and ge@@ ar our@@ selves for B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual we should also int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y national di@@ al@@ og@@ ue on the issues that def@@ ine us as a nation .
To spe@@ ed up the process of building infrastructure we will fin@@ alise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphas@@ is on energy effici@@ ency .
I particularly want to pay tr@@ ibute to the mining industry for the way in which they have ass@@ isted us and the economy to res@@ olve a re@@ al cr@@ is@@ is that h@@ it us on the 2@@ 4@@ th of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
I m@@ ention this important matter here because the current challenges we are fac@@ ing have led some el@@ se@@ where in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tour@@ nam@@ ents success@@ fully .
In this regard , R@@ 2 ,@@ 3 billion has been bud@@ g@@ eted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R@@ 5 billion in tax inc@@ en@@ tives over three years will support industrial policy .
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordin@@ ate this activity supported by the line De@@ part@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ gy and Public En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises .
The first of these is a pro@@ posal that we should develop an o@@ ath that will be rec@@ ited by learners in their morning school ass@@ emb@@ l@@ ies , as well as a Y@@ outh Pl@@ ed@@ ge ext@@ ol@@ ling the vir@@ tu@@ es of hum@@ ane conduct and human sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity among all South Africans .
Am@@ ong other things , this will ent@@ ail setting up a new coordin@@ ating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , br@@ ing@@ ing together the jud@@ ici@@ ary and m@@ agistr@@ acy , the police , pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors , correc@@ tional services and the Leg@@ al A@@ id Board , as well as other interventions , including the empow@@ erment of the Community Police For@@ ums .
We must ensure that we sus@@ tain this approach .
Once more we thank the S@@ pr@@ ing@@ b@@ ok@@ s for show@@ ing the way when they w@@ on the R@@ ug@@ by World Cup last year .
The approach is one of common action rather than rec@@ r@@ imin@@ ation .
Ab@@ out R@@ 1 billion over the bas@@ el@@ ine will be allocated to programmes that f@@ all within the E@@ P@@ W@@ P ;
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ying the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme which , by sur@@ pass@@ ing the set targ@@ ets , has sh@@ own potential to ab@@ sor@@ b more entr@@ ants : this will include increas@@ ed int@@ ake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure , dou@@ bl@@ ing the number of children en@@ rol@@ led in E@@ arly Ch@@ ild@@ h@@ ood Development to over 6@@ 00 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practi@@ tion@@ ers trained and employed , and increasing the number of car@@ eg@@ iv@@ ers .
An el@@ ement of governments A@@ pe@@ x of Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities will be delib@@ er@@ ate focus on matters of skills development .
Fur@@ ther to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate our economic growth and development we will implement the Indus@@ trial Pol@@ ic@@ y Ac@@ tion Pl@@ an .
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepar@@ ed to assist in wh@@ at@@ ever way they can .
T@@ ask te@@ ams are currently working in many areas .
For this , we will require a National W@@ ar R@@ oo@@ m for a W@@ ar Ag@@ ainst P@@ overty br@@ ing@@ ing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Wor@@ ks and Health as well as provincial and local administr@@ ations , which will work with n@@ ong@@ overn@@ mental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific hous@@ ehol@@ ds and implement them as a matter of urg@@ ency .
C@@ ut@@ ting across these plans , and therefore a critical pri@@ ority , is information and communic@@ ations technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right .
In a meeting with the Chair@@ man of General Elec@@ tr@@ ic during the course of last week , G@@ E off@@ ered to assist by proc@@ uring sc@@ ar@@ ce tur@@ b@@ ine equipment on our behalf .
As such , in the spirit of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual , government int@@ ends this year to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the campaign to identify specific hous@@ ehol@@ ds and individuals in d@@ ire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing period , to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate their pl@@ ight in those individual hous@@ ehol@@ ds .
In South Africa our own large companies such as S@@ as@@ ol , Ang@@ lo and B@@ H@@ P B@@ ill@@ it@@ on are all in con@@ cre@@ te discus@@ sions with the De@@ part@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ gy and Public En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constr@@ ain@@ t .
We face an emergency but we can over@@ come the problems in a rel@@ atively short period .
We are taking steps to enh@@ ance Es@@ kom@@ s maintenance capacity .
introduc@@ ing the system of products for pre@@ fer@@ ential proc@@ ur@@ ement by government from small , medi@@ um and mic@@ ro@@ -@@ enterprises ; and through the S@@ m@@ all En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ises Development Ag@@ ency setting up a rig@@ or@@ ous system to ensure that the 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day payment period is observ@@ ed .
We are a min@@ er@@ als resource economy .
O@@ f great importance , our success in the fight against crime dep@@ ends on cooperation among all of us as law@@ -@@ ab@@ id@@ ing citizens , in@@ spir@@ ed by the principles of r@@ ule of law , respect for our jud@@ ici@@ ary and pursu@@ it of equ@@ al human rights , which our Constitution en@@ jo@@ ins us to ob@@ serve in our d@@ ail@@ y lives and pr@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ ements .
In@@ formed by the im@@ per@@ ative to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the off@@ ensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Kh@@ amp@@ ep@@ e Jud@@ icial Commission on the func@@ tion@@ ing and location of the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations and continu@@ ing refl@@ ections on this matter , including the re@@ form of the Cr@@ imin@@ al Justice System , we shall by the end of Mar@@ ch this year , inter@@ act with Parliament on legislation and other dec@@ isi@@ ve measures required further to enh@@ ance our capacity to fight organised crime .
The Minister of Education will next week el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the national deb@@ ate on these matters .
They will be supported by technical te@@ ams from E@@ D@@ I H@@ ol@@ d@@ ings , E@@ sk@@ om and the National E@@ ner@@ gy E@@ ff@@ ici@@ ency Ag@@ ency .
In@@ deed , we are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged by the good respon@@ se from the private sector as demonstr@@ ated through the commitment by the CE@@ O@@ s of 7@@ 0 of the J@@ S@@ E@@ -@@ listed companies to work with government in addres@@ sing the challenge of sc@@ ar@@ ce skills .
All these actions , taken together with the electricity s@@ aving measures , will improve cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y and ra@@ ise the res@@ erve marg@@ in .
Let us ensure that all hand@@ s are on dec@@ k to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has h@@ it us , in@@ spir@@ ed by the approach that our circumstances call for B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual !
Att@@ ached to this will be a manufac@@ turing strategy for the development in South Africa of S@@ et T@@ op B@@ ox@@ es , which should be fin@@ alised by the mid@@ dle of the year .
I will also shor@@ tly anno@@ un@@ ce a team of E@@ ner@@ gy Ch@@ amp@@ ions cons@@ isting of prom@@ in@@ ent and know@@ led@@ ge@@ able South Africans who will assist government with the energy effici@@ ency campaign and in@@ form invest@@ ors and communities on the ac@@ tual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges .
These are :
Once more I would like to emphas@@ ise that we remain determined to support the aut@@ om@@ o@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Mot@@ or Industry Development Programme is maint@@ ained .
I will conv@@ ene a meeting of the Jo@@ int Presid@@ ential Wor@@ king Gro@@ up@@ s to coordin@@ ate our over@@ all actions .
In this regard , in the spirit of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , moder@@ n@@ ised , efficient and trans@@ formed criminal justice system .
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prior@@ it@@ ise further interventions in the further education and training col@@ leg@@ es , the sector education and training authorities , resour@@ c@@ ing schools in the low@@ est three qu@@ in@@ til@@ es , fre@@ e@@ ing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and spe@@ eding up on-@@ th@@ e-@@ job training for professional gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates .
The mas@@ sive E@@ sk@@ om build programme in new gener@@ ation , trans@@ mission and distribution capacity will continue ; and where possible , some projects will be acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated .
In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not suff@@ ici@@ ently integrated .
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settl@@ ements , people with dis@@ abilities or ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic ill@@ n@@ esses and the el@@ der@@ ly .
Al@@ ready , money has been allocated for S@@ ent@@ ech to become a w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess inter@@ net wh@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er as well as fin@@ ance its dig@@ it@@ isation .
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building bloc@@ ks of the essential energy efficient future we d@@ are not avo@@ id .
What will continue to in@@ form us as we take this st@@ ep will be the ab@@ sol@@ ute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , effici@@ ency and co@@ ord@@ ination of our law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies .
O@@ f course , I have ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no dou@@ b@@ t that we will hon@@ our our under@@ taking to F@@ IF@@ A and the world community of s@@ occ@@ er players and lo@@ v@@ ers to create all the necessary conditions for the hol@@ ding of the best ever F@@ IF@@ A S@@ occ@@ er World Cup tour@@ nam@@ ent .
Par@@ al@@ le@@ l to this initi@@ ative is a special project to exam@@ ine interventions required to deal with vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 .
It is in@@ ev@@ itable that if we are to continue on our growth pat@@ h as a manufac@@ turing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry .
But we will all ag@@ ree that our society , and the poor specif@@ ically , cannot wa@@ it for strateg@@ ies and di@@ al@@ og@@ ues and work@@ sh@@ ops important as these may be .
Am@@ ong others , we will make an evaluation of the g@@ ender mach@@ in@@ ery so as to improve all aspec@@ ts related to women empow@@ erment .
Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ ement of a go@@ al of health for all includes int@@ ensi@@ fied implementation of the National Strateg@@ ic Pl@@ an against HIV and A@@ ID@@ S . We also aim during the course of this year to reduce t@@ ub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is def@@ aul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , tr@@ ain over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-@@ drug res@@ ist@@ ant and extr@@ eme drug res@@ ist@@ ant T@@ B pati@@ ents receive treatment .
spe@@ eding up land and agr@@ arian re@@ form with det@@ ailed plans for land ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion , better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support , and improv@@ ing the capital base and re@@ ach of the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ -@@ Agr@@ icultural Fin@@ ance Institu@@ tions of South Africa to provide mic@@ ro@@ -@@ credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentr@@ ations of farm d@@ well@@ ers and those with high ev@@ ic@@ tion rates , and we aim to increase black ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship in agricultural production by 5 per year , and the aud@@ it on land own@@ ership will be spe@@ eded up ;
This is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same approach we must adop@@ t as we continue to pre@@ p@@ are to host the F@@ IF@@ A Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations Cup in 200@@ 9 and the 20@@ 10 F@@ IF@@ A S@@ occ@@ er World Cup which will k@@ ick off in our country 8@@ 5@@ 4 days from today .
R@@ 7@@ 00 mil@@ lion has already been given to the SA@@ N@@ DF to start sc@@ al@@ ing up this programme ;
This must in@@ spir@@ e B@@ afana B@@ afana , as it must in@@ spir@@ e our ath@@ let@@ es who will comp@@ ete in the Beijing Olymp@@ ic G@@ ames later this year .
sc@@ al@@ ing up the National Y@@ outh Service programme including a gr@@ ad@@ uated increase of the int@@ ake in the M@@ ilit@@ ary S@@ k@@ ills Development programme of the South African National D@@ ef@@ ence For@@ ce from the current 4 000 to 10 000 .
The Minister of Fin@@ ance will provide more information in the B@@ ud@@ get spe@@ ech on the support that the government will provide for the energy effici@@ ency campaign and to E@@ sk@@ om in its build programme .
This will include the training of mas@@ ter tr@@ ain@@ ers who will provide basic lit@@ er@@ acy cl@@ asses to 3@@ 00 000 ad@@ ul@@ ts and youth in 200@@ 8 .
Two such issues des@@ erve br@@ ief m@@ ention .
In the programme to provide sustainable human settl@@ ements , we are now able to provide 2@@ 60 000 housing units per ann@@ um , and an agreement has been re@@ ached with the South African Local Government Association to place a mor@@ at@@ or@@ ium on the sale of land that can be avail@@ ed for the housing programme .
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 2@@ 9@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
O@@ ver the past year , we carried out the m@@ and@@ ate of SA@@ DC to assist the political lead@@ ership of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting s@@ olution to the political challenges they face .
At local government level , we shall assist the first 1@@ 50 of our municipalities to develop an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption strateg@@ ies .
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified der@@ ive from serious we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in terms of our planning .
What I do know and her@@ eb@@ y make b@@ old to say is : wh@@ at@@ ever the challenges of the mom@@ ent , we are still on course !
What is outstanding , however , is a proced@@ ural matter relating to the tim@@ ing and the manner of en@@ ac@@ t@@ ment of the new agreed D@@ r@@ aft Constitution .
To ensure syst@@ em@@ atic monitoring in this regard , SA@@ L@@ G@@ A has agreed to provide quar@@ ter@@ ly reports on the work being done .
We call on all African comp@@ atr@@ i@@ o@@ ts to do wh@@ at@@ ever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these neg@@ ative develop@@ ments .
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the mach@@ in@@ ery of government so that it me@@ ets its oblig@@ ations to citizens .
As requested by the SA@@ DC He@@ ads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negoti@@ ations .
I say this with un@@ sh@@ ak@@ e@@ able convic@@ tion because I am certain that South Africans are cap@@ able and g@@ ear@@ ed to meet the challenge of history to str@@ ain every sin@@ ew of our being to respon@@ d to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world , and se@@ ize the opportunities that our countr@@ y@@ s progress over the last f@@ our@@ te@@ en years has provided .
In the same meas@@ ure , we shall continue to contribute to the re@@ alisation of the objectives of the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on C@@ lim@@ ate Ch@@ ange and ong@@ oing improv@@ ements in this regard , and in g@@ iving further imp@@ et@@ us to the negoti@@ ations on the W@@ T@@ O D@@ oh@@ a Development R@@ ound .
Our mul@@ tif@@ ac@@ eted relations with the D@@ em@@ oc@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ongo will continue , as we se@@ ek to contribute to the efforts of the sis@@ ter people of that country to att@@ ain las@@ ting peace , and implement their re@@ construction and development programme .
Improvement of performance in the public service also dep@@ ends on the quality of lead@@ ership provided by the executive and s@@ enior management .
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector un@@ ions , we will conv@@ ene a Public Sec@@ tor Summit to th@@ r@@ as@@ h out these issues so that the spirit of B@@ ath@@ o P@@ ele can find con@@ cre@@ te expres@@ sion wh@@ er@@ ever a government service is provided .
The m@@ ush@@ ro@@ om@@ ing of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peo@@ ples con@@ fir@@ ms that the Ch@@ in@@ a-@@ South Africa Par@@ t@@ nership for G@@ row@@ th and Development is a strategic relationship of mu@@ tual benefit , which can only gro@@ w from streng@@ th to streng@@ th .
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and elec@@ toral laws , and other matters that have been in cont@@ ention for many years .
Fur@@ ther , it is critical to enh@@ ance the commitment of public employees to their duties a task that belong@@ s to the lead@@ ership , the public serv@@ ants themselves and the trade union movement .
This includes improv@@ ing the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ ot@@ ing out cor@@ rup@@ t el@@ ements and p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing the new ID card .
We will , of course , continue to carr@@ y out our t@@ as@@ ks in the United Nations Security Council .
It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and mul@@ til@@ ateral inter@@ actions with our neighb@@ ours and the Europe@@ an Union , within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership A@@ gre@@ ement are completed as soon as possible , prem@@ ised on acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the development of our region .
Sec@@ ondl@@ y , by M@@ ay of every year all s@@ enior manag@@ ers should have fil@@ ed their K@@ ey Per@@ form@@ ance A@@ gre@@ ements with relevant authorities .
Wor@@ king with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented .
A critical st@@ ep in this regard is the cons@@ ol@@ id@@ ation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achiev@@ ing regional integration .
There are sim@@ ple but urgent and critical prior@@ ities we will attend to , as part of the over@@ all effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state .
This year we celeb@@ rate the t@@ ent@@ h ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the establishment of diplom@@ atic relations between South Africa and the Pe@@ o@@ ples Republic of China .
We are particularly concerned by the s@@ ens@@ el@@ ess violence and k@@ ill@@ ings in both K@@ enya and C@@ had , develop@@ ments that clear@@ ly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the reg@@ ener@@ ation of the African continent .
Accord@@ ingly , we jo@@ in the SA@@ DC He@@ ads of State and Government in congratul@@ ating the parties to the Zimbabwe Di@@ al@@ og@@ ue for their tr@@ ul@@ y comm@@ end@@ able achiev@@ ements and encour@@ age them to work together to res@@ olve the rem@@ aining proced@@ ural matter .
Our focus , in promoting the African Ag@@ enda this year , will be on the strength@@ ening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , N@@ ep@@ ad .
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by par@@ liam@@ ent , including the necessary constitutional am@@ end@@ ments .
We shall continue this year to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y efforts to streng@@ then local government capacity in line with the 5@@ -@@ year Local Government Strateg@@ ic Ag@@ enda .
Imp@@ ell@@ ed by the d@@ esi@@ re to promote the improv@@ ement in the quality of life of all peo@@ ples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strength@@ ening our participation in the Indi@@ a-@@ Br@@ az@@ il@@ -@@ South Africa for@@ ums , the New Afric@@ a-@@ A@@ sia Strateg@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership , the Non-@@ Al@@ ig@@ ned Mov@@ ement , the Group of 7@@ 7 and negoti@@ ations to complete the SA@@ C@@ U-@@ M@@ erc@@ us@@ or trade agreement .
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Sou@@ thern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chair@@ person@@ ship of SA@@ DC in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 200@@ 9 further to give imp@@ et@@ us to the regional end@@ e@@ av@@ ours in this regard .
But we should not take this for granted .
The programme that we have out@@ lin@@ ed incor@@ por@@ ates the commit@@ ments that our country has agreed with the lead@@ ership of the continent through the African Pe@@ er Rev@@ iew M@@ echanis@@ m .
We had an opportunity , on the fr@@ ing@@ es of the AU Summit in Add@@ is Ab@@ aba form@@ ally to present a com@@ prehensive report to the lead@@ ership of SA@@ DC on this matter .
F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , it has been agreed across all s@@ pher@@ es of government that especially the critical vac@@ an@@ cies should be filled within six months of such op@@ en@@ ings emerg@@ ing .
These global responsib@@ ilities , including the hos@@ ting of the 20@@ 10 F@@ IF@@ A S@@ occ@@ er World Cup , bring out in even b@@ older rel@@ ief the conf@@ idence that human@@ ity has in our country as a strategic play@@ er in the nob@@ le end@@ e@@ av@@ ours of all human@@ ity .
In short , the parties involved in the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue have re@@ ached full agreement on all matters relating to the subst@@ an@@ tive matters the parties had to address .
I am conf@@ ident that , under the lead@@ ership of the International Mar@@ k@@ eting Council , Trade and Inv@@ est@@ ment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other ag@@ encies we shall all put our hand@@ s on dec@@ k to communic@@ ate to the rest of the world the spirit of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual , and our continu@@ ing adv@@ ance towards the cre@@ ation of a society that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to g@@ ather in our country to celeb@@ rate Afric@@ as human@@ ity in 20@@ 10 .
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in K@@ enya , C@@ had , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western S@@ ah@@ ara , C@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , Som@@ alia , the Com@@ or@@ os and the C@@ entr@@ al African Republic to find las@@ ting peace and st@@ ability .
Cr@@ itical in this regard , is the strength@@ ening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Pe@@ ace and Security Council of the African Union .
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to tr@@ ack the implementation of this decision .
Th@@ us , as part of our A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enh@@ ance governments capacity to put in place re@@ alis@@ tic and integrated plans , cover@@ ing all s@@ pher@@ es of government .
With all hand@@ s on dec@@ k , and committed to conduct our business in an un@@ us@@ ual and more effective f@@ ash@@ ion , we shall sus@@ tain the process of our re@@ construction and development and take it to even high@@ er levels .
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard .
In order further to improve the service being provided to vul@@ ner@@ able sectors such as v@@ eter@@ ans , women and youth , we shall review the structures deleg@@ ated to carr@@ y out these functions and exam@@ ine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specif@@ ically established to focus on youth development and empow@@ erment .
This we shall do , in@@ spir@@ ed by the common as@@ pir@@ ation of the peo@@ ples of the continent for gre@@ ater integration in pursu@@ it of contin@@ ental unity at all levels .
H@@ aving said all that I have said , I come back to the question : what is the state of our nation as we ent@@ er 200@@ 8 !
We are conf@@ ident that , informed by their abh@@ or@@ r@@ ence of the s@@ cour@@ ge of racism and the dev@@ ast@@ ating consequ@@ ences it continues to ex@@ act on human@@ ity , the governments and peo@@ ples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Rev@@ iew Con@@ ference achiev@@ es its objectives .
N@@ ext year , South Africa will play host to the Rev@@ iew Con@@ ference to eval@@ uate the implementation of the decisions of the World Con@@ ference Ag@@ ainst R@@ ac@@ ism which was held in our country in 200@@ 1 .
If any@@ thing , the spirit of B@@ us@@ iness Un@@ us@@ ual should apply to all individuals who carr@@ y the priv@@ il@@ eg@@ e of being public serv@@ ants .
Th@@ ir@@ dly , recogn@@ ising that the Department of Home Affairs t@@ ou@@ ches the cor@@ e of every citizens life , we will this year int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the implementation of the tur@@ n@@ around strategy approved by Cabinet .
In this regard , we sal@@ ute that br@@ ave son of our people , S@@ ol@@ om@@ on K@@ al@@ ush@@ i M@@ ahlang@@ u who went to the g@@ allows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the pro@@ ud knowledge that his blo@@ od would n@@ our@@ ish the t@@ ree of freedom .
In the F@@ ir@@ st Dec@@ ade of Fre@@ edom , economic growth av@@ er@@ aged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on av@@ er@@ age from 200@@ 4 to 200@@ 7 .
I have wal@@ ked that long road to freedom .
O@@ f critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
addres@@ sing the investment challenge by improv@@ ing s@@ av@@ ings , appropri@@ ately deploy@@ ing resources from p@@ ension and provid@@ ent funds , housing , financial sector contribu@@ tions and black economic empow@@ erment ;
In the end , the challenge is as much about regul@@ ation ;
Y@@ et access to employment we@@ igh@@ s heav@@ ily on rural women , youth and people with dis@@ ability .
However , while women constitu@@ te about 3@@ 4 of all s@@ enior posi@@ tions in the public service , this f@@ alls short of the targ@@ et of par@@ ity that we had set our@@ selves .
In@@ deed , it is a matter of pro@@ ud record that between 199@@ 5 and 200@@ 3 , the economy created about on@@ e-@@ and-@@ half mil@@ lion net new j@@ obs ;
and every@@ one of them has passed the test to rev@@ e@@ al a democracy that is excep@@ tion@@ ally res@@ ili@@ ent .
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would har@@ dly dif@@ fer regarding the need to improve our education system ;
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services .
But we should also take advant@@ age of the special registration weekend arrang@@ ed by the Elec@@ toral Commission of South Africa t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w and Sund@@ ay , the 7@@ th and 8@@ th of Febru@@ ary respec@@ tively .
This sugg@@ ests that the poverty situation has improved remar@@ kab@@ ly , particularly among people experi@@ enc@@ ing the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ eg@@ ree of wel@@ f@@ are de@@ priv@@ ation .
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector invest@@ ments ;
Th@@ roug@@ h adv@@ oc@@ acy campa@@ ig@@ ns and ind@@ eed as a result of the part@@ nerships we have bu@@ ilt with organisations represent@@ ing these vul@@ ner@@ able groups , we have improved aw@@ ar@@ eness around issues that aff@@ ect them ;
However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and ori@@ ent@@ ation of some public serv@@ ants , especially those at the co@@ al@@ -@@ face of direct inter@@ action with the public .
and progres@@ si@@ vely encour@@ aged the main@@ stre@@ am@@ ing of these concer@@ ns .
Mad@@ am Deputy President ;
We do have today a well-@@ func@@ tion@@ ing democratic system , based on principles of trans@@ par@@ ency and op@@ en@@ ness , with n@@ um@@ erous pl@@ at@@ forms for public participation and independent institutions m@@ and@@ ated by the Constitution to support democracy .
and that among the most successful programmes have been campa@@ ig@@ ns on child imm@@ un@@ isation and nu@@ tr@@ ition .
Y@@ et our centr@@ al and immedi@@ ate task is fully to appreci@@ ate the consequ@@ ences of these develop@@ ments on our own economy and our region , and dev@@ ise respon@@ ses that will minim@@ ise their impact especially on the most vul@@ ner@@ able sectors of our society .
lower dem@@ and has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated a sc@@ al@@ ing down of production ; the cre@@ ation of j@@ obs is neg@@ atively affected and in some sectors re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment has become a re@@ ality .
Th@@ ough some progress has been made , at 0 ,@@ 2 , the situation is less im@@ pres@@ sive with regard to people with dis@@ ability employed in government , meas@@ ured against the 2 targ@@ et we set our@@ selves .
On a critical matter of det@@ ail , the res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers further ob@@ serve :
driven by the d@@ esi@@ re to improve the quality of life of all South Africans .
In this regard , some five years ago , we were h@@ over@@ ing around 16 of gro@@ s@@ s fi@@ x@@ ed capital formation as a per@@ cent@@ age of G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Produc@@ t . S@@ uch has been the acc@@ el@@ eration in investment that today this fig@@ ure stand@@ s at 2@@ 2 , clos@@ er to the 2@@ 5 that we pro@@ jec@@ ted to att@@ ain only in 20@@ 14 .
Exc@@ ept for the services sector , we have not seen a large en@@ ough exp@@ an@@ sion in critical sectors , especially manufac@@ turing .
This points to we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in our neighbour@@ ho@@ ods , especially in building the b@@ ond@@ s of community sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity that would assist us in prev@@ enting and comb@@ ating crime .
For inst@@ ance , access to pot@@ able water has improved from 6@@ 2 in 199@@ 6 to 8@@ 8 in 200@@ 8 ;
This will be comb@@ ined with promotion of the Pro@@ udl@@ y South Africa campaign and strong@@ er action on illegal impor@@ ts .
And so , 15 years into our democracy , we can ass@@ ert that the fe@@ ar , the in@@ security and the lo@@ ath@@ ing that 1@@ 00 years ago gener@@ ated an ex@@ clusive and ill@@ us@@ ory peace among colon@@ ial mas@@ ters , were not only un@@ fo@@ und@@ ed ; but tr@@ ul@@ y mis@@ placed .
Ir@@ on@@ ically , prec@@ is@@ ely where education is most needed to help bre@@ ak the cy@@ c@@ le of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teach@@ er capacity are least im@@ pres@@ sive .
All these are as@@ sign@@ ments for the coming period .
With regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves .
and to conduct f@@ isc@@ al and mon@@ et@@ ary policy in a manner that exp@@ ands access to services and reduc@@ es the in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary bur@@ den while at the same time ens@@ uring m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic st@@ ability and sus@@ tain@@ ability .
A h@@ und@@ red and thir@@ ty years on , we can only mar@@ v@@ el at the hope and the res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used those st@@ out hear@@ ts .
These are the issues that the com@@ prehensive rev@@ am@@ p of the criminal justice system has started to address .
and how have we adv@@ anced the cause of human development and human dig@@ nity since the 200@@ 4 democratic m@@ and@@ ate !
Members of Cabinet and Spe@@ ak@@ ers of Provincial Leg@@ isl@@ atures ;
Th@@ us , the question whether growth is equ@@ it@@ ably shar@@ ed should form a centr@@ al p@@ ill@@ ar of all our economic consider@@ ations .
We o@@ we our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 2@@ 7 A@@ pr@@ il 199@@ 4 , for the first time coll@@ ec@@ tively took their dest@@ in@@ y into their own hand@@ s .
This will include support by our development fin@@ ance institutions and lo@@ an fin@@ ance from international ag@@ encies , as well as partnership with the private sector and util@@ isation of resources controlled by workers such as p@@ ension funds .
In@@ deed , these observ@@ ations are confirm@@ ed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African and Col@@ our@@ ed communities has dec@@ lin@@ ed , part@@ ly as a result of high@@ er rates of employment and access to social gr@@ ants .
This is not in pursu@@ it of a so@@ -@@ called racial ag@@ enda .
F@@ our@@ th@@ ly , government will sus@@ tain and exp@@ and social expenditure , including progres@@ si@@ vely ext@@ ending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reduc@@ ing the age of elig@@ ib@@ ility for old age p@@ ension to 60 years for men .
In education , we have seen a dro@@ p in the educ@@ ator : lear@@ ner r@@ ati@@ o ;
It is South Afric@@ as people who have ens@@ ured its progress ;
It is in this context that the Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated and Sh@@ ar@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative is being implemented , ens@@ uring that all the critical bloc@@ k@@ ages such as infrastructure bot@@ tl@@ en@@ ec@@ ks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regul@@ atory gr@@ idl@@ oc@@ ks and effici@@ ency of government services are addres@@ sed in a foc@@ us@@ sed and syst@@ em@@ atic manner .
Fur@@ ther , our anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment programme is not only the larg@@ est in the world ;
In this regard , H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members , I am happ@@ y to report that in the inter@@ actions between The Presid@@ ency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jo@@ int@@ ly to dev@@ ise interventions that would minim@@ ise the impact of this cr@@ is@@ is on our society .
At the same time , much effort has been put into improv@@ ing infrastructure in poor areas .
Com@@ r@@ ades and fri@@ ends ;
The For@@ m@@ er Chief Justice and For@@ m@@ er Presid@@ ing Offic@@ ers of Parliament ;
Sec@@ ondl@@ y , we will int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y public sector employment programmes .
V@@ ari@@ ous measures have been put in place to improve the effici@@ ency of the public service , including financial management , Th@@ us@@ ong Service C@@ ent@@ res and other service delivery innov@@ ations , izimb@@ izo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm lead@@ ership .
On its part , government will ad@@ ap@@ t industrial fin@@ anc@@ ing and inc@@ en@@ tive instrum@@ ents to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encour@@ age development fin@@ ance institutions to assist fir@@ ms in distr@@ ess because of the cr@@ is@@ is .
Chief Justice L@@ anga ;
and even more remar@@ k@@ able , about 500 000 j@@ obs a year between 200@@ 4 and 200@@ 7 .
But ours is a jour@@ ney of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence .
adv@@ anc@@ ing equ@@ ity , developing skills , cre@@ ating economic opportunities and ext@@ ending services ;
At the level of the national and provincial legisl@@ atures , indic@@ ations are that the nation will this year sur@@ p@@ ass the 3@@ 2 women represent@@ ation level achieved in 200@@ 4 and hop@@ eful@@ ly , even the 4@@ 0 achieved in the 200@@ 6 local government elections .
The fact that the private sector l@@ ag@@ s behind in chang@@ ing the dem@@ ograph@@ ics of management and sk@@ illed occup@@ ations , in enterpr@@ ise development and so on in part makes our country a l@@ agg@@ ard in the high growth stak@@ es .
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the targ@@ et for 1-@@ mil@@ lion work opportunities through the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme was att@@ ained in 200@@ 8 , a year ear@@ lier than envisaged in the 200@@ 4 elec@@ toral m@@ and@@ ate .
Sh@@ aring the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equ@@ itable role for the state in using the f@@ isc@@ us as an instrum@@ ent of re@@ distribution and shar@@ ing the bur@@ den of providing public goods .
I am certain that we are all agreed that the well@@ being of our society dep@@ ends , cr@@ itic@@ ally , on the progress we make in exp@@ and@@ ing the n@@ ations we@@ alth and ens@@ uring that the benefits of economic growth are shar@@ ed by the people as a whole .
We call to min@@ d these organisations and leaders to emphas@@ ise the spirit of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used the democratic struggle even when every@@ thing look@@ ed ble@@ ak ;
As H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members will be aware , our government has made the fight against cor@@ ruption one of the cor@@ e areas of focus .
H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members will be fam@@ ili@@ ar with most of the data on matters relating to the social w@@ age .
and crimes against women and children have not ab@@ ated in any significant meas@@ ure , is a matter of great concern .
It points to we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in the effici@@ ency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management .
Sec@@ ondl@@ y , al@@ though the reduc@@ tions in poverty have been substantial , agg@@ reg@@ ate in@@ equ@@ ality increas@@ ed during the 199@@ 0@@ s . Th@@ ir@@ dly , the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics under@@ l@@ ying the poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality trends determine the b@@ road policy out@@ look poverty has dec@@ reas@@ ed since the transi@@ tion , but in@@ equ@@ ality has not improved .
That initi@@ ative la@@ id the fo@@ und@@ ation for global cons@@ ensu@@ s , through the United Nations , on the approach to negoti@@ ations in South Africa .
C@@ omb@@ ined , these develop@@ ments b@@ ode ill for the re@@ ven@@ ues we need to exp@@ and the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects .
In a few months from now the people of our country will pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce on the lead@@ ership they pre@@ fer to carr@@ y forward the nob@@ le work of this great freedom f@@ igh@@ ter and other fo@@ und@@ ers of our democracy .
These ide@@ als are shar@@ ed by vir@@ tually all of human@@ ity , as refl@@ ected in the United Nations M@@ ill@@ enn@@ ium Development Go@@ als .
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ;
It points to syst@@ em@@ ic we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses in the criminal justice system , from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of off@@ end@@ ers .
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the vo@@ ters rol@@ l is clos@@ ed .
It is these and other pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts who should take the gre@@ at@@ est share of the acc@@ ol@@ ade when we pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce that wh@@ at@@ ever economic stor@@ ms may p@@ ound our shor@@ es , wh@@ at@@ ever political un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties may visit our coll@@ ective cons@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness in a transi@@ tion our nation is in a good state .
But let us not del@@ ude our@@ selves : as with the rest of our social life , such trans@@ formation is still at its nas@@ cent st@@ ages .
But I have disc@@ overed the sec@@ re@@ t that after cl@@ imb@@ ing a great h@@ ill , one only f@@ ind@@ s that there are many more h@@ ills to clim@@ b .
O@@ f course we do know that the d@@ rop@@ out rate particularly at sec@@ ond@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary levels is un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high , and the educ@@ ational system has yet to produce the requ@@ is@@ ite k@@ ind@@ s of skills needed by society .
We hope that all political parties will , as they fin@@ alise their elec@@ toral l@@ ists , make their contribution to this nob@@ le end@@ e@@ av@@ our !
In@@ deed , government can be pro@@ ud that we have changed the dem@@ ograph@@ ic com@@ position of the public service , which in vir@@ tually all respec@@ ts appro@@ x@@ im@@ ates the char@@ ac@@ ter of our society .
Your Ex@@ cell@@ encies , Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors and High Commis@@ sion@@ ers and vis@@ iting foreign dig@@ nit@@ aries ;
In@@ deed , in a period in which others are experi@@ enc@@ ing or pro@@ jec@@ ting rec@@ es@@ sions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a s@@ lower rate .
In this lat@@ ter period , for the first time since the att@@ ain@@ ment of democracy , more j@@ obs were being created than the number of new entr@@ ants into the labour market , th@@ us reduc@@ ing the un@@ employment rate from 3@@ 1 in 200@@ 3 to 2@@ 3 in 200@@ 7 .
HIV impacts most sev@@ er@@ ely on young women .
In this regard , we wish to acknow@@ ledge On@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ ot@@ se T@@ i@@ ro@@ s co@@ us@@ in , P@@ at T@@ l@@ h@@ ag@@ wana .
These are challenges that our country will cer@@ tain@@ ly have to address going forward .
Wh@@ ile our appro@@ aches may dif@@ fer , the objectives that we need to aim for are clear@@ ly and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ously set out in our Constitution : to create a un@@ ited , non@@ racial , n@@ ons@@ ex@@ ist , democratic and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous society that pl@@ ays a positive role in building a better world .
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
This improv@@ ement is m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in access to basic services a rap@@ id dec@@ line in as@@ set poverty even prec@@ eded the dec@@ line in mon@@ ey@@ -@@ me@@ tr@@ ic poverty .
R@@ elig@@ ious leaders and representatives of civil society ;
and the following b@@ road categories of respon@@ ses are under discus@@ sion :
Y@@ et many health facilities do not always have the required med@@ ic@@ ines , appropriate st@@ aff@@ ing levels , and const@@ ant supply of basic services such as cle@@ an run@@ ning water and electricity .
The s@@ cour@@ ge of crime remains a major sour@@ ce of in@@ security for South Africans .
I will however c@@ ite a few in@@ stances again to sk@@ et@@ ch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face .
but it is exp@@ and@@ ing all the time , with over 6@@ 90 000 pati@@ ents having been initi@@ ated on anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment since the comm@@ enc@@ ement of the programme .
For in@@ spir@@ ing hope in a period of des@@ p@@ air , we sal@@ ute them .
Mad@@ ame Speaker and H@@ on@@ our@@ able Chairperson ;
to provide efficient , dec@@ ent and equ@@ itable health care ;
The reduc@@ tion is to a large extent due to a dr@@ am@@ atic exp@@ an@@ sion in social gr@@ ants expenditure from 200@@ 2 on@@ wards .
al@@ most univ@@ ers@@ al access in terms of en@@ rol@@ ment at primary school level ;
That we were able five months ago to ensure a se@@ am@@ less transi@@ tion and continu@@ ity in the systems of government is than@@ ks to the mat@@ urity of our constitutional system , refl@@ ected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive old and new and the ste@@ ad@@ y hand of our public sector manag@@ ers .
In this regard , we have through legislation , international con@@ ventions , regul@@ ations and campa@@ ig@@ ns ens@@ ured that con@@ cre@@ te efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with dis@@ ability and the el@@ der@@ ly .
Sh@@ aring the benefits of growth should also include acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated implementation of af@@ firm@@ ative action , including B@@ road@@ -based Bl@@ ack E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Em@@ pow@@ erment .
We can con@@ dem@@ n the policies of governments which took their ey@@ es off the b@@ all and allowed the rap@@ ac@@ ious licence of un@@ regul@@ ated mar@@ kets to w@@ re@@ ak hav@@ o@@ c on financial systems .
access to fin@@ ance and inf@@ low@@ s of capital have tur@@ ned for the wor@@ se ; But we are all too aware that , because we are strong@@ ly integrated into the world economy , dem@@ and for our ex@@ ports has dec@@ lin@@ ed ;
The pre@@ val@@ ence of h@@ ung@@ er among children has vir@@ tually hal@@ v@@ ed over four years .
It is ap@@ t therefore to rem@@ ind our@@ selves of that instruc@@ tive observ@@ ation of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence , continu@@ ity and change , by former President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , in his bi@@ ograph@@ y , L@@ ong W@@ al@@ k to Fre@@ edom :
W@@ ith@@ in this gener@@ ation are the early leaders of SA@@ S@@ O , which included : Str@@ ini M@@ oo@@ dl@@ ey , Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or B@@ ar@@ ney P@@ it@@ y@@ ana , S@@ te@@ ve B@@ iko , On@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ ot@@ se T@@ ir@@ o , H@@ arr@@ y N@@ eng@@ we@@ khulu , Th@@ emba S@@ ono , M@@ ap@@ et@@ la M@@ oh@@ ap@@ i , M@@ osi@@ ou@@ a L@@ ek@@ ota , Joh@@ n@@ n@@ y Is@@ sel and M@@ th@@ uli ka Sh@@ ezi .
These then are some of the adv@@ ances that democracy has b@@ roug@@ ht ;
as it is about consistent enforc@@ ement .
Ab@@ ove all , I stand before you with pr@@ ide and conf@@ idence that the South Africa we celeb@@ rate today wor@@ l@@ ds apar@@ t from the div@@ isions , conflict and ex@@ clus@@ ion of a m@@ ere 15 years ago is a product of the lab@@ ours and to@@ ils of South African women and men from all wal@@ ks of life .
but from the point of view of government systems , we can dr@@ aw sol@@ ace from the fact that over 7@@ 0 of cases of cor@@ ruption reported in the media become public because government has det@@ ected the wr@@ ong@@ doing and is in fact acting against it .
I have made mis@@ steps along the way .
cre@@ ating more j@@ obs , better j@@ obs and dec@@ ent work for all through high@@ er rates of investment , public works programmes , sector part@@ nerships and strateg@@ ies , local proc@@ ur@@ ement , small enterpr@@ ise promotion and support for co@@ oper@@ atives ;
And so , Mad@@ ame Speaker and H@@ on@@ our@@ able Chairperson , we should ask our@@ selves : how have our actions defined the pat@@ h of South African soci@@ et@@ y@@ s ev@@ olution in the f@@ if@@ te@@ en years since the birth of our democracy ;
We@@ alth is created in order to improve peo@@ ples quality of life .
What we do know is that the regul@@ atory environment in our country and the counter@@ -@@ cy@@ cl@@ ical budget policies we adopted have hel@@ ped us avo@@ id the wor@@ st impact of the cr@@ is@@ is .
The focus on mic@@ ro@@ -@@ economic re@@ forms in the past dec@@ ade , and the efforts , especially since 200@@ 4 more syst@@ ematic@@ ally to rem@@ ove the variety of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to growth have had a positive impact .
Al@@ tern@@ atives to lay@@ off@@ s will be explor@@ ed , including longer hol@@ id@@ ays , ext@@ ended training , short time and j@@ ob@@ -@@ shar@@ ing .
On the one hand , plans to exp@@ and employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies will continue .
O@@ f course , this should not de@@ tr@@ act from our oblig@@ ation to continue inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating the issue of the quality of these j@@ obs , including the rights and benefits that workers en@@ jo@@ y .
However , we should not under@@ esti@@ m@@ ate the challenges we face .
We can do all this ; and we will be per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly jus@@ tified .
On the other , we will spe@@ ed up the introduc@@ tion of the next ph@@ ase of the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme .
Y@@ et , the extent of their re@@ ach within our society remains far below expec@@ t@@ ations .
I have tr@@ ied not to f@@ al@@ ter ;
Im@@ port@@ antly , shar@@ ing the benefits of growth should ent@@ ail lab@@ our@@ -@@ ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , ens@@ uring that there is dec@@ ent work .
It may as well be that the systems of prev@@ enting and p@@ un@@ ishing cor@@ ruption are still in@@ adequate ;
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ;
that we should ind@@ eed , in the words of the Fre@@ edom Char@@ ter , open ever wid@@ er the do@@ ors of learning and of culture !
F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increas@@ ed to R@@ 6@@ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ billion for the next three years .
In this context we also wish to acknow@@ ledge the l@@ ate E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im M@@ og@@ ale , the fo@@ unding President 30 years ago of the Cong@@ ress of South African St@@ ud@@ ents , and his pe@@ ers .
Mad@@ am Speaker of the National Assembly ; State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress of the President of South Africa , K@@ g@@ al@@ ema Mot@@ lan@@ the , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town Febru@@ ary 200@@ 9 Mr . Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
Our challenge is to trans@@ l@@ ate these v@@ isions into programmes and projects for effective implementation .
Wh@@ ile the cons@@ um@@ er b@@ oo@@ m , imp@@ ell@@ ed by r@@ ising employment and in@@ comes and low in@@ fl@@ ation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encour@@ aged by the b@@ road can@@ v@@ ass of opportunities for further exp@@ an@@ sion going forward .
E@@ v@@ idence of the social w@@ age is also seen in mas@@ sive improv@@ ements in access to primary health facilities .
and the progress that government has made in ful@@ f@@ illing the m@@ and@@ ate of the elec@@ tor@@ ate .
Al@@ low me to acknow@@ ledge L@@ uc@@ as M@@ ahlang@@ u , bro@@ ther of K@@ al@@ ush@@ i , represent@@ ing the M@@ ahlang@@ u family .
We may even say that , in a str@@ ange quir@@ k of f@@ ate , many aspec@@ ts of our constitutional order have been t@@ ested in the recent past ;
and an improv@@ ement in the number of p@@ up@@ ils pass@@ ing math@@ ematic@@ s , to qu@@ ote a few exam@@ ples .
A group of val@@ i@@ ant stud@@ ents bro@@ ke away from N@@ U@@ SA@@ S to found the South African St@@ ud@@ ents Organis@@ ation 4@@ 0 years ago .
Your wor@@ ship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ;
Al@@ low me , Mad@@ ame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to ur@@ ge all elig@@ ible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shap@@ e our dest@@ in@@ y our@@ selves .
S@@ ol@@ om@@ on M@@ ahlang@@ u was continu@@ ing a tr@@ adi@@ tion of the w@@ arr@@ i@@ ors of yes@@ ter@@ year , among whom we coun@@ t those under K@@ ing C@@ etsh@@ wayo who in 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 9 def@@ e@@ ated the Brit@@ ish arm@@ y in Is@@ andl@@ wana , in defence of the freedom of the indig@@ en@@ ous people of our country and the s@@ over@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty of their lands .
These include , in the first inst@@ ance , high@@ er rates of investment by both the public and private sectors .
Wh@@ ile the number of grant benefici@@ aries was 2 ,@@ 5@@ -@@ mil@@ lion in 199@@ 9 , by 200@@ 8 this had increas@@ ed to 12 ,@@ 4@@ -@@ mil@@ lion .
Our economy remains larg@@ ely rel@@ i@@ ant on mining and agr@@ iculture for ex@@ ports .
What , on the sur@@ face , started off as a financial cr@@ is@@ is among a few l@@ ending institutions has expl@@ od@@ ed into a global credit cr@@ un@@ ch , with sev@@ ere consequ@@ ences for ac@@ tual production and trade .
and mal@@ ar@@ ia cases have mas@@ si@@ vely dec@@ lin@@ ed .
It is prec@@ is@@ ely this we@@ ak@@ ness which accoun@@ ts for the large C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent Ac@@ coun@@ t def@@ ic@@ it particularly when we entered high@@ er r@@ ang@@ es of growth .
The same challenges con@@ front the private sector .
In this regard , we should sal@@ ute the l@@ ate President of the African National Cong@@ ress , Ol@@ iver Reg@@ in@@ al@@ d T@@ ambo , for initi@@ ating and p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing through contin@@ ental and world bod@@ ies what became a comp@@ ass for the peac@@ eful resolution of the conflict in our country .
But we do know that the reduc@@ tion has not been f@@ ast en@@ ough , not even at the 7@@ -@@ 10 rate that we set our@@ selves for various categories of contact crime .
In re@@ ality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is cer@@ tain@@ ly going to perform well below its ac@@ tual potential .
O@@ ver@@ all , we are pro@@ ud of the adv@@ ances in our social programmes .
I stand before the people of South Africa with hum@@ ility at the opportunity I have had to occup@@ y the high@@ est office in the land as a consequ@@ ence of the un@@ ique cir@@ cum@@ st@@ ance ar@@ ising out of the decision of the lead@@ ing party in government to rec@@ all the former President .
They include Br@@ ian B@@ un@@ ting , B@@ il@@ ly N@@ air , N@@ cum@@ isa K@@ ondlo , Joh@@ n G@@ om@@ omo , Jo@@ e N@@ hl@@ an@@ hla , C@@ as S@@ al@@ oo@@ j@@ ee , Joh@@ n Sch@@ ip@@ per@@ s and J@@ an van E@@ c@@ k .
N@@ atur@@ ally , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties of a political transi@@ tion can pose more questions than there are currently answ@@ ers .
It is therefore appropriate on this occas@@ ion to celeb@@ rate the 20@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the adoption of the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of the O@@ AU Ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c Committee on Sou@@ thern Africa on the Qu@@ es@@ tion of South Africa adopted in A@@ ug@@ ust , 19@@ 8@@ 9 comm@@ only known as the H@@ ar@@ are Dec@@ lar@@ ation .
As such , we have been forc@@ ed to t@@ one down our for@@ ec@@ as@@ ts in terms of growth and j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security ;
I am certain that H@@ on@@ our@@ able Members will ag@@ ree that the human@@ ity of our democratic disp@@ ensation should find expres@@ sion in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vul@@ ner@@ able in society .
G@@ overn@@ ments social programmes have also improved the as@@ set base of the poor , in the form of housing with 2 ,@@ 6@@ -@@ mil@@ lion sub@@ si@@ dis@@ ed houses provided .
We should of course acknow@@ ledge that the land re@@ distribution programme as well as pos@@ t-@@ settl@@ ement support could have been handl@@ ed f@@ aster and better .
This has created the possib@@ ility mas@@ si@@ vely to exp@@ and this programme and improve its quality .
W@@ ith@@ in the g@@ al@@ ax@@ y of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the mis@@ for@@ t@@ une since last Febru@@ ary to b@@ id the final f@@ are@@ well .
This is in part a consequ@@ ence of delib@@ er@@ ate programmes by government to exp@@ and public infrastructure .
Vi@@ ol@@ ence against women and children is much too high .
Wh@@ ile that Con@@ vention defined the terr@@ itor@@ ial integr@@ ity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial op@@ pres@@ sion and ex@@ clus@@ ion .
We know too that South Africa is less sev@@ er@@ ely affected than many other countries .
But we cannot satis@@ f@@ y our@@ selves m@@ er@@ ely with qu@@ anti@@ t@@ ative change .
to under@@ scor@@ e the responsibility that res@@ ts on our sho@@ ul@@ ders to adv@@ ance the ide@@ als that so many s@@ ac@@ r@@ ific@@ ed for , ref@@ using to be c@@ ow@@ ed by set@@ b@@ acks and h@@ ard@@ ships .
These difficul@@ ties have co@@ incid@@ ed with a period in which in@@ fl@@ ation and interest rates are still too high .
It is ste@@ ad@@ ily growing strong@@ er , under@@ p@@ in@@ ned by a Constitution har@@ dly equ@@ all@@ ed in the world .
There is no g@@ ain@@ s@@ aying that , by any meas@@ ure , the progress made since 199@@ 4 has been im@@ pres@@ sive .
And yet human@@ ity today fac@@ es the dang@@ er that the att@@ ain@@ ment of these objectives could be post@@ p@@ oned by many years , if not dec@@ ades , as a consequ@@ ence of the economic cr@@ is@@ is that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the global v@@ ill@@ age .
Government is pain@@ fully aware that ab@@ ject poverty is still too wid@@ es@@ pread in our society ; and the level of in@@ equ@@ ality is too high .
On both coun@@ ts , the private sector is l@@ agg@@ ing far behind .
In@@ deed , the ro@@ bus@@ t@@ ness of our political engag@@ ement during this season of elec@@ toral cont@@ est which we all ag@@ ree should be dig@@ n@@ if@@ ied and peac@@ eful is the sur@@ est guaran@@ tee of the continued sur@@ viv@@ al and de@@ ep@@ ening of our democracy .
As a consequ@@ ence , some of us may be m@@ es@@ m@@ er@@ ised by the transi@@ ent wav@@ es of stor@@ my we@@ ather and h@@ un@@ ch our sho@@ ul@@ ders in the face of these he@@ ad@@ wind@@ s of economic tur@@ bul@@ ence and political t@@ um@@ ul@@ t .
I am priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed to address the Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beg@@ inning of this last session of our Th@@ ir@@ d D@@ em@@ oc@@ ratic Parliament .
B@@ e it in education , health , housing , water or s@@ an@@ itation , the centr@@ al question that con@@ fron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
and to int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y the fight against crime and cor@@ ruption .
We have in the past 15 years done our best to att@@ ack this s@@ cour@@ ge through the social w@@ age .
But ne@@ ither can there be dou@@ b@@ t that the challenges remain imm@@ ense .
O@@ ver the years , we have ste@@ ad@@ ily improved the structures of govern@@ ance .
To these , I would also like to ad@@ d Ms H@@ el@@ en S@@ uz@@ man , a tr@@ ul@@ y dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the ch@@ amb@@ ers of the old .
In this regard , where necessary , we will find cre@@ ative ways to ra@@ ise funds .
It is a matter of pro@@ ud record that , for inst@@ ance , f@@ emal@@ e-@@ he@@ aded hous@@ ehol@@ ds have received a b@@ igg@@ er-@@ than@@ -@@ av@@ er@@ age share of the social w@@ age including housing and health care ;
But I can rest only for a mom@@ ent , for with freedom comes responsib@@ ilities , and I d@@ are not ling@@ er , for my long wal@@ k is not yet ended .
9@@ 5 of South Africans now live within 5 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ res of a health facility ; and we are informed that all clin@@ ics now have access to pot@@ able water .
These South Africans re@@ present the hope and res@@ ili@@ ence that character@@ ise our nation .
On this we still have some way to go .
I c@@ ite these issues not because they are all@@ -@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing n@@ or that by identif@@ ying them we would c@@ ure all the ills of our society .
Th@@ ose f@@ ear@@ s and in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ities gave r@@ ise to dec@@ ades of res@@ istance .
and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come .
The global economic m@@ el@@ t@@ down does pose serious dang@@ ers for our economy in terms of job los@@ ses and the quality of life of our people .
H@@ on@@ our@@ able Le@@ ad@@ ers of Pol@@ itical Par@@ ties and Members of Parliament , Tr@@ ad@@ itional leaders ;
W@@ ith@@ in South Africa , it also informed the content of the 19@@ 8@@ 9 Con@@ ference for a D@@ em@@ oc@@ ratic F@@ ut@@ ure br@@ ing@@ ing together pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts from vir@@ tually all wal@@ ks of life .
To qu@@ ote work conducted by a team of academ@@ ics at the Un@@ iversity of Stell@@ en@@ bos@@ ch , led by Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or Serv@@ a@@ as van der B@@ er@@ g :
Am@@ ong hous@@ ehol@@ ds that include children , the number of hous@@ ehol@@ ds reporting that a child went h@@ ung@@ ry dec@@ lin@@ ed dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally between 200@@ 2 and 200@@ 6 .
The fact that incidents of viol@@ ent robberies in hous@@ ehol@@ ds and businesses have been on the increase ;
All k@@ ind@@ s of statistics can be c@@ ited to att@@ est to this .
And because we have a low s@@ av@@ ings rate , we have had to rel@@ y on shor@@ t-@@ term capital f@@ low@@ s to fin@@ ance the def@@ ic@@ it as well as our investment programmes .
W@@ ith@@ in public and private institutions , the possib@@ ility of ne@@ f@@ ari@@ ous sch@@ em@@ es siph@@ oning off resources through cor@@ ruption is always a sour@@ ce of great concern
It is common cause that , after the economic st@@ ag@@ nation of the l@@ ate 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s and early 199@@ 0@@ s , South Africa has experi@@ enced the long@@ est period of sus@@ tained economic growth since the record@@ ing of such statistics started in 19@@ 4@@ 0 .
D@@ ail@@ y experience , in poor and af@@ flu@@ ent neighbour@@ ho@@ ods al@@ ike , is one of ap@@ preh@@ ension at the possib@@ ility of viol@@ ent att@@ ack .
That cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous st@@ ep to dev@@ ise a framework that would se@@ ek peace and re@@ conciliation , in the place of war and conflict , rev@@ ers@@ ed for good the f@@ al@@ se d@@ aw@@ n of a h@@ und@@ red years ago : that is , the con@@ clus@@ ion in 19@@ 0@@ 9 of the National Con@@ vention which pres@@ aged the formation of the Union of South Africa .
Our democracy is heal@@ thy .
This is because of the trans@@ formation these institutions have under@@ g@@ one , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights culture , their dem@@ ograph@@ ic com@@ position , and their systems of account@@ ability .
Our economy has become more open , and since 199@@ 4 it has ste@@ ad@@ ily become integrated into the global system .
Ch@@ ild imm@@ un@@ isation cover@@ age has ste@@ ad@@ ily increas@@ ed to about 8@@ 5 ;
The mess@@ age of their her@@ o@@ ic de@@ eds r@@ ings tr@@ ue today as it did those many years ago , that we should together exp@@ and the fron@@ ti@@ ers of opportunity ;
This is larg@@ ely a result of mas@@ sive exp@@ an@@ sion in access to the Ch@@ ild Sup@@ port Gr@@ ant , which increas@@ ed from 3@@ 4@@ -@@ thous@@ and benefici@@ aries in 199@@ 9 to 8 ,@@ 1-@@ mil@@ lion in 200@@ 8 .
I have taken a mom@@ ent here to rest , to ste@@ al a view of the gl@@ or@@ ious v@@ ista that sur@@ ro@@ unds me , to look back on the dist@@ ance I have come .
As such , the rate of growth in ex@@ ports has not been as high as in compar@@ able countries .
All this led to the negoti@@ ations process which cul@@ min@@ ated in our first democratic elections in 199@@ 4 .
We have bu@@ ilt a system of heal@@ thy inter@@ govern@@ mental relations across the s@@ pher@@ es , and improved integration within and among them .
R@@ ather , I have ch@@ os@@ en to do so to emphas@@ ise the point that South Africa does not suff@@ er the poverty of v@@ isions .
In the cent@@ res of learning , the same res@@ istance fu@@ ell@@ ed the re@@ k@@ in@@ dl@@ ing of m@@ ass strugg@@ les during the col@@ d w@@ int@@ er after the ban@@ ning of the lib@@ eration movement and the im@@ prison@@ ment of most of its s@@ enior lead@@ ership .
Si@@ x years ago , leaders of our people came together in a G@@ row@@ th and Development Summit and re@@ ached agreement on the t@@ as@@ ks all of us should under@@ take to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to hal@@ ve un@@ employment and poverty by 20@@ 14 .
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es need improv@@ ement .
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days con@@ clud@@ e consult@@ ations with the Elec@@ toral Commission and the Provincial Premi@@ ers and anno@@ un@@ ce the date of the elections .
This is refl@@ ected , among others , in legislation , rules and regul@@ ations govern@@ ing public serv@@ ants and political offic@@ e-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers al@@ ike , part@@ nerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-@@ cor@@ ruption h@@ ot@@ lin@@ es .
As we look back over the past f@@ if@@ te@@ en years , I wish to acknow@@ ledge the commitment and hard work of Presid@@ ents N@@ el@@ son Mandela and Th@@ abo Mb@@ eki and the many women and men who played their role in ste@@ ering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legisl@@ atures across the three s@@ pher@@ es of government and the Jud@@ ici@@ ary ;
We can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of manag@@ ers of bi@@ g cor@@ por@@ ations which pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the cr@@ is@@ is .
O@@ f course , the over@@ all crime rate , having pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 2 , has consist@@ ently dec@@ lin@@ ed .
We still have a long way to go .
M@@ ine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in compl@@ eting the m@@ and@@ ate accord@@ ed the African National Cong@@ ress in the 200@@ 4 elections , and in lay@@ ing the fo@@ und@@ ation for the pos@@ t-@@ election administration to h@@ it the ground run@@ ning .
F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , mon@@ ey@@ -@@ me@@ tr@@ ic poverty dec@@ lin@@ ed substanti@@ ally since the tur@@ n of the cent@@ ury .
Th@@ roug@@ h that sim@@ ple but prof@@ ound act of casting a bal@@ lot for a government of all the people of our country , we tur@@ ned our b@@ acks on a past that d@@ eh@@ um@@ anis@@ ed us all .
Y@@ et , in being br@@ ut@@ ally self-@@ critical , we should not l@@ ose sig@@ ht of the fact that what we are ass@@ essing is a system that enj@@ oy@@ s , by far , better leg@@ itim@@ acy than ever experi@@ enced in our country .
And we do hope that this time ro@@ und , the renew@@ ed efforts of the international community to find a las@@ ting s@@ olution to this conflict will be@@ ar fr@@ uit , so Isra@@ el@@ is and Palestin@@ ians can en@@ jo@@ y peace and security as neighb@@ ours within their s@@ over@@ eign terr@@ itor@@ ies .
These immedi@@ ate measures will be informed by the princi@@ ple of a counter@@ -@@ cy@@ cl@@ ical f@@ isc@@ al policy .
and our under@@ -@@ 20 s@@ occ@@ er team did qu@@ ite well in an extr@@ em@@ ely competi@@ tive environment .
We also wish in this regard to congratul@@ ate all our s@@ por@@ ting te@@ ams which have ass@@ erted South Afric@@ as pursu@@ it of excell@@ ence over the past year .
But bey@@ ond this , the tr@@ ue leg@@ acy of this spec@@ t@@ ac@@ le will be in our ability to show@@ case South African and African hos@@ pit@@ ality and human@@ ity to change once and for all per@@ c@@ ep@@ tions of our country and our continent among peo@@ ples of the world .
In this regard , we wish to comm@@ end the Com@@ peti@@ tion Commission for the firm hand that they are show@@ ing to ensure that cul@@ pr@@ its are b@@ roug@@ ht to book .
At the same time we will improve SA@@ D@@ C@@ s inter@@ action with the Comm@@ on Mar@@ ket of East and Sou@@ thern Africa and the East African Community . These initiatives will be undertaken in order to ext@@ end rather than we@@ ak@@ en the de@@ ep set of relations that we en@@ jo@@ y within the Sou@@ thern African Custom@@ s Union .
In the coming few months p@@ ending the national and provincial elections , we will end@@ e@@ av@@ our to complete that popul@@ ar m@@ and@@ ate .
We also comm@@ it our@@ selves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l and its success@@ ors for the benefit of future gener@@ ations among our own people and peo@@ ples of the world .
but , hop@@ eful@@ ly , also with regard to political di@@ al@@ og@@ ue .
This also impl@@ ies a rap@@ id reduc@@ tion in government deb@@ t levels wh@@ en@@ ever conditions tur@@ n for the better .
In@@ form@@ ing these our end@@ e@@ av@@ ours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the m@@ and@@ ate accord@@ ed this government in 200@@ 4 ;
We will as always se@@ ek to streng@@ then cooperation with these and other countries in pursu@@ it of that which is good for human@@ ity .
There can be no jus@@ tification for such acts of wan@@ ton des@@ truc@@ tion and s@@ av@@ ag@@ ery .
In addition , we will more wid@@ ely util@@ ise the Social D@@ istr@@ ess Rel@@ ief Gr@@ ant and food security measures specif@@ ically also to targ@@ et those either un@@ prot@@ ected by the U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ment In@@ sur@@ ance Fund or who have ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted their benefits .
We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have for@@ ged with Br@@ az@@ il and Indi@@ a through I@@ B@@ SA ;
In our own country , we will emb@@ ark on these under@@ tak@@ ings as part of the process of setting our society on a high@@ er growth and development pat@@ h .
The partnership bu@@ ilt in the recent period between the lead@@ ership of the DRC and R@@ w@@ anda hol@@ ds out a prom@@ ise for adv@@ ances in matters of security and in dealing with the human@@ itarian cr@@ is@@ is ;
G@@ in@@ i@@ el de V@@ il@@ li@@ ers and his team have w@@ on the D@@ ak@@ ar R@@ ally ;
Cr@@ itic@@ ally , we should also saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the integr@@ ity of the world trade system , complete the current negoti@@ ations on the D@@ oh@@ a R@@ ound of world trade negoti@@ ations , and ensure that development aid is not sc@@ al@@ ed down .
But we are not in dou@@ b@@ t that that mom@@ ent will yet come so@@ on@@ er rather than later .
and ext@@ ending the number of municipalities that have set up Ch@@ ildr@@ ens Rights F@@ ocal Po@@ in@@ ts bey@@ ond the current 60 .
and facilit@@ ating the processes aimed at strength@@ ening the mach@@ in@@ er@@ ies dealing with matters of g@@ ender equ@@ ality such as 5@@ 0@@ /@@ 50 represent@@ ation in dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making structures , youth development , the rights of people with dis@@ ability and ch@@ ildr@@ ens rights including compl@@ eting consult@@ ations on the National Y@@ outh Pol@@ ic@@ y , prepar@@ ing for the implementation of the African Y@@ outh Char@@ ter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Y@@ outh Development Ag@@ ency ;
strength@@ ening adv@@ oc@@ acy on the rights of people with dis@@ ability ;
cre@@ ating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the s@@ pher@@ es of government , including national strategic planning ;
This r@@ ich her@@ it@@ age points to Africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of science and lit@@ er@@ ature , ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ y and comm@@ er@@ ce , inter@@ rup@@ ted by the s@@ la@@ ve trade and the s@@ cr@@ amb@@ le for Afric@@ as we@@ alth .
Al@@ ong with other countries of the South we will continue to pursu@@ e the cause of the res@@ tructuring of the United Nations , the International M@@ on@@ et@@ ary Fund and other mul@@ til@@ ateral institutions so they refl@@ ect the changed and chang@@ ing global re@@ ality and operate in a democratic , equ@@ itable and trans@@ parent manner .
I re@@ fer here in particular to the F@@ IF@@ A World Cup in 20@@ 10 as well as the Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations Cup a few months from now .
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreci@@ ation that measures to protect the environment and m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate the impact of climate change can also contribute to j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
Now the work of re@@ construction can start in ear@@ n@@ est ;
In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the human@@ itarian cr@@ is@@ is in that country .
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , d@@ are not ling@@ er , for long wal@@ k is not yet ended .
In this regard , how we position our country to take advant@@ age of un@@ ique opportunities that have come our way , will be of par@@ amount importance .
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anti@@ competi@@ tive be@@ havi@@ our on the part of some of our cor@@ por@@ ations .
These and other programmes , including the A@@ pe@@ x Pr@@ i@@ or@@ ities identified in the State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress last Febru@@ ary , form the bed@@ roc@@ k of our efforts to con@@ clud@@ e the popul@@ ar m@@ and@@ ate and l@@ ay the fo@@ und@@ ation for the future .
We do hope though that civil society will enh@@ ance its own level of activ@@ ism to ensure , among other things , that as in@@ put pr@@ ices dec@@ line , the benefit is fel@@ t by the population .
In@@ deed , over the past 15 years we have s@@ par@@ ed no effort to ensure that Africa experi@@ ences her renewal in what should in ac@@ tual practice be the African C@@ ent@@ ury .
and to that we can att@@ ach no pr@@ ice !
implementing the com@@ prehensive programme we have put in place to elimin@@ ate the inc@@ idence of ch@@ ol@@ era in various parts of the country ;
We are of course R@@ ug@@ by World Ch@@ amp@@ ions ;
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ying the campaign to s@@ ave energy , so as to manage the current difficul@@ ties and change our own be@@ havi@@ our , while at the same time spe@@ eding up the projects to build new capacity and util@@ ise altern@@ ative energy sour@@ ces recogn@@ ising that in addition to the consequ@@ ences of climate change , resources such as fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ els and water are dec@@ lin@@ ing in the same meas@@ ure as dem@@ and is increasing ;
and South Africa stand@@ s ready to assist wh@@ er@@ ever we can .
We are also encour@@ aged that , wh@@ at@@ ever f@@ its and star@@ ts may se@@ em to character@@ ise the progress of the people of the D@@ em@@ oc@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ongo on their mar@@ ch to st@@ ability and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , that progress is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
The ab@@ id@@ ing l@@ ess@@ on from this experience is that we need strong@@ er part@@ nerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale , not only to st@@ em the impact of the cr@@ is@@ is ; but also to put in place measures that would ob@@ vi@@ ate a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence .
We were able in the past year to con@@ clud@@ e further negoti@@ ations with the Europe@@ an Union on our strategic partnership ; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engag@@ ement will prev@@ ail as we fin@@ alise the mul@@ til@@ ateral negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership A@@ gre@@ ements with countries in our region .
J@@ ust two weeks ago , South Africa completed with M@@ ali part of the arch@@ ives to pres@@ erve the an@@ ci@@ ent man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts of T@@ imb@@ uk@@ tu .
V@@ ir@@ tually all the projects and plans are completed or near@@ ing comple@@ tion from st@@ ad@@ ia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommod@@ ation , to health and imm@@ ig@@ ration plans confirm@@ ing the conf@@ idence of the global s@@ occ@@ er fr@@ ater@@ nity that ours will be a tr@@ ul@@ y successful tour@@ nam@@ ent .
integr@@ ating into the work of the relevant Cl@@ us@@ ters the f@@ ind@@ ings of research on Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and mic@@ ro@@ -@@ enterprises and rural development initiatives ;
int@@ ensi@@ f@@ ying efforts to rev@@ am@@ p the criminal justice system , including better for@@ ensic capacity , rap@@ id increase in the number of detectives , op@@ tim@@ al util@@ isation of information and communic@@ ations technology , and better management of the courts ;
As would have been ev@@ id@@ enced by various develop@@ ments in the past few months , South Africa will use the priv@@ il@@ eg@@ e of ch@@ air@@ ing SA@@ DC to streng@@ then this critical regional institution , with particular emphas@@ is on implementing Summit res@@ olutions and c@@ ement@@ ing regional strategic co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
We have on coun@@ t@@ less occas@@ ions expres@@ sed our concern at the pers@@ ist@@ ence of conflict in the M@@ id@@ dle East in general and in Israel and Palest@@ ine in particular .
Our special congratul@@ ations to the government and people of C@@ uba on this the 5@@ 0@@ th ann@@ iv@@ ers@@ ary of the att@@ ain@@ ment of their s@@ over@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty and , with it , the freedom to cho@@ ose their pat@@ h of development .
We wish on this occas@@ ion to ext@@ end our congratul@@ ations to the people and the lead@@ ership of Z@@ amb@@ ia , G@@ h@@ ana and the United States of Americ@@ a for elections the sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ ism of which trans@@ c@@ ends the n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w bo@@ und@@ aries of their n@@ ati@@ on-@@ st@@ ates .
The leng@@ th of time towards att@@ aining a high@@ er tr@@ a@@ jec@@ tory may have been st@@ ret@@ ched some@@ what .
sub@@ mit@@ ting the SA@@ DC Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on G@@ ender and Development to Parliament ;
The dep@@ th of our dis@@ appointment at the recent es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict and mas@@ sive loss of life , of especially civil@@ ians including children , women and the el@@ der@@ ly ind@@ eed def@@ ies des@@ cription .
We are conf@@ ident that , because it car@@ es , the international community will part@@ ner the people of Zimbabwe as they bl@@ aze out along a new tr@@ ail .
It is ste@@ ad@@ ily growing strong@@ er .
We wish in this regard to congratul@@ ate all the parties in Zimbabwe for con@@ clud@@ ing negoti@@ ations , deliv@@ ering the ul@@ tim@@ ate pr@@ ize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ continent as a whole : that is , a stable and leg@@ itim@@ ate government g@@ ear@@ ed to address the challenges that the people face .
but bey@@ ond this , that strong@@ er surv@@ e@@ ill@@ ance and action on a global scale have become un@@ avo@@ id@@ able and necessary .
O@@ ver these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mu@@ tual benefit to be g@@ ained from our partnership .
In the same meas@@ ure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursu@@ e these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western S@@ ah@@ ara , C@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , Som@@ alia and el@@ se@@ where .
S@@ te@@ ad@@ ily but sur@@ ely , our continent is progres@@ sing towards her ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance , with the interest of her people r@@ ising to the top of their leaders ag@@ enda , ass@@ er@@ ting her hope and her res@@ ili@@ ence on the world stage .
Both in the G@@ 20 meetings and other inter@@ actions in mul@@ til@@ ateral institutions , our government has arg@@ u@@ ed for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the cr@@ is@@ is orig@@ inated and where it is most sev@@ ere .

continu@@ ing research and consult@@ ations on the Com@@ prehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health In@@ sur@@ ance ;
our Par@@ al@@ ymp@@ ians continue to do us pro@@ ud ;
This initi@@ ative should sp@@ ur us on to act in concer@@ t with other countries on our continent and further af@@ i@@ eld to better the human con@@ dition .
Special m@@ ention in this regard is due to SA@@ DC facilit@@ ator , former President Th@@ abo Mb@@ eki and the team that ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly and pati@@ ently hel@@ ped to bring the process to a successful con@@ clus@@ ion .
We are tr@@ ul@@ y hear@@ t@@ ened that , yes@@ ter@@ day , the Zimbab@@ we@@ an Parliament passed Am@@ endment 1@@ 9 of the Constitution , lay@@ ing the basis for the install@@ ation of an in@@ clusive government .
This , and this in the main , is the sour@@ ce of our conf@@ idence when we say that the nation is in a good state .
And we believe that , after five con@@ secu@@ tive w@@ ins , the national s@@ occ@@ er team is now more conf@@ id@@ ently g@@ ear@@ ing itself to perform above expec@@ t@@ ations !
and the im@@ per@@ ative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections f@@ ind@@ s a ready pl@@ at@@ form to implement its programmes without und@@ ue del@@ ays .
We look forward to further strength@@ ening this partnership when we host the South Afric@@ a-@@ EU Summit later this year .
We are priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed that this year we con@@ clud@@ e celeb@@ r@@ ations of the first dec@@ ade of our diplom@@ atic relations with the Pe@@ o@@ ples Republic of China .
We believe that the time has come to streng@@ then domestic regul@@ ation and super@@ v@@ ision of the financial system ;
and ind@@ eed to the strength@@ ening b@@ ond@@ s that our country has been for@@ g@@ ing with Rus@@ sia , and countries in A@@ sia , the M@@ id@@ dle East , as well as L@@ ati@@ n and North Americ@@ a .
It is this , and this al@@ one , that has informed our pers@@ ist@@ ence in ass@@ isting the people of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting s@@ olution to the cr@@ is@@ is in that country .
Special acc@@ ol@@ ades are due to our cr@@ ic@@ ket team which has cl@@ imb@@ ed to the ap@@ e@@ x of global r@@ ank@@ ings .
As part of the many det@@ ailed projects cont@@ ained in the governments Programme of Ac@@ tion , we will pay particular attention to :
We will int@@ ensi@@ f@@ y our efforts in@@ spir@@ ed by the en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m , the hope and the res@@ ili@@ ence of the South African people in pursu@@ it of that which is good for all of us .
However , we will ensure that the levels of b@@ or@@ row@@ ing by government are pr@@ ud@@ ent and sustainable .
S@@ ig@@ n@@ ific@@ antly , the ex@@ clus@@ ion of black people from this Union was one of the ch@@ ief reasons for the formation of the African National Cong@@ ress in 19@@ 12 . 
On this great day , let me also acknow@@ ledge the role played by the

Special international gu@@ ests , especially the Chairperson of the African Union Commission , Mr J@@ e@@ an P@@ ing ; 
The rel@@ ease of Mad@@ iba was b@@ roug@@ ht about by the res@@ ol@@ ute strugg@@ les of the South African people . 
I stand before you this ev@@ ening , 20 years since President N@@ el@@ son R@@ ol@@ ihl@@ ahla Mandela wal@@ ked out of pris@@ on . 
Let us pursu@@ e the ide@@ al for which Mad@@ iba has f@@ ought his enti@@ re life the ide@@ al of a democratic and free society , in which all persons live together in har@@ mon@@ y and with equ@@ al opportunities . 
We called a joint sitting in the ev@@ ening so that the majority in our country , workers and scho@@ ol@@ children , can be part of the occas@@ ion . 
South African and foreign media ; 
As we celeb@@ rate Mad@@ ib@@ a's rel@@ ease today , let us recomm@@ it our@@ selves to building a better future for all South Africans , black and white . 
It was this that la@@ id the gro@@ und@@ work for the histor@@ ic announc@@ ements by President F@@ W de K@@ l@@ er@@ k , 20 years ago . 
I stand before you , not as a pro@@ ph@@ et but as a h@@ umb@@ le serv@@ ant of you , the people . 
I therefore place the rem@@ aining years of my life in your hand@@ s . 
South Africa is yet to acknow@@ ledge in full , the critical role played by the former President of the ANC , Com@@ r@@ ade Ol@@ iver T@@ ambo , who la@@ id the fo@@ und@@ ation for this country to become a sh@@ in@@ ing example of freedom and democracy . 
Many of those who lost their j@@ obs were the b@@ read@@ w@@ in@@ ners in poor fam@@ il@@ ies . 
The nation will rec@@ all that during the 200@@ 9 State of the N@@ ation Add@@ ress , I announc@@ ed that the Ex@@ p@@ anded Public Wor@@ ks Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by Dec@@ ember 200@@ 9 . 
These words in@@ spir@@ e us not to rest until we achieve the ide@@ als of a society free of poverty and de@@ priv@@ ation .

You will off course rec@@ all that the m@@ asses of this country , in their different form@@ ations , respond@@ ed with determin@@ ation to the call to make the country ung@@ overn@@ able and apartheid un@@ work@@ able .

In Dec@@ ember 200@@ 9 , Cabinet approved a tur@@ n@@ around strategy for local government . 
Government must work f@@ aster , h@@ ard@@ er and s@@ mar@@ ter . 
E@@ con@@ om@@ ic activity is r@@ ising in South Africa , and we expec@@ t growth going forward . 
Pro@@ pos@@ als will be t@@ abled to subsid@@ ise the cost of h@@ ir@@ ing you@@ ng@@ er workers , to encour@@ age fir@@ ms to take on in@@ experi@@ enced staff . 
We also need to integr@@ ate g@@ ender equ@@ ity measures into the G@@ overn@@ ment's Programme of Ac@@ tion . 
It will out@@ line what is to be done , how , by whom , within what time period and using what meas@@ ur@@ ements and resources . 
We are working with high@@ er education institutions to ensure that elig@@ ible stud@@ ents obtain financial assistance , through the National St@@ ud@@ ent Financial A@@ id Sch@@ eme .

E@@ sk@@ om will continue to build additional gener@@ ation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power stations . 
During this year of action , let us work together to make local government every@@ bod@@ y's business . 
The minis@@ ters who are responsible for a particular out@@ come , will sign a det@@ ailed delivery agreement with the President . 
We held a meeting with m@@ ay@@ ors and municipal manag@@ ers last year .

In addition , we will work to improve the effec@@ tiveness of local government , infrastructure development and human settl@@ ements . 
We will ensure that our ra@@ il net@@ work is rel@@ i@@ able , competi@@ tive and better integrated with our se@@ a ports .

U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ment rates for young people are substanti@@ ally high@@ er than the av@@ er@@ age . 
We want learners and teach@@ ers to be in school , in class , on time , learning and te@@ aching for seven hours a day . 
A further exp@@ an@@ sion of public employment programmes is also under@@ way . 
The defin@@ ing fe@@ ature of this administration will be that it know@@ s where people live , under@@ stand@@ s their needs and respond@@ s f@@ aster . 
We need to inv@@ est in our youth to ensure a sk@@ illed and cap@@ able work@@ force to support growth and job cre@@ ation . 
We will under@@ take a number of key activities towards the achiev@@ ement of these outcomes . 
Local government must work . 
We will implement all the under@@ tak@@ ings made on World A@@ ID@@ S D@@ ay relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures . 
Our education targ@@ ets are sim@@ ple but critical . 
Our education and skills programmes will increase our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and competi@@ tiveness . 
When this administration came into office last year , we under@@ took to work h@@ ard@@ er to build a strong develop@@ mental state . 
Our rural development programme will improve rural produc@@ tiv@@ ity , and the lives of people living in rural areas .

To ensure rel@@ i@@ able power supply , we have established an Inter@@ -@@ Minis@@ ter@@ ial Committee on E@@ ner@@ gy , to develop a 20@@ -@@ year integrated resource plan . 
We will establish an independent system oper@@ ator , separate from E@@ sk@@ om H@@ ol@@ d@@ ings . 
Res@@ ul@@ ts will be sent to parents to tr@@ ack progress . 
This includes local infrastructure and ter@@ ti@@ ary projects and lit@@ er@@ acy projects , hom@@ e-@@ based care , school maintenance and early child@@ h@@ ood development initiatives . 
Government will therefore not with@@ dr@@ aw its support measures . 
Com@@ pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts and est@@ e@@ em@@ ed gu@@ ests , 
We will also reduce inf@@ ant mort@@ ality through the mas@@ sive imm@@ un@@ isation programme . 
Now is the time to l@@ ay the gro@@ und@@ work for strong@@ er growth going forward , and for growth that g@@ ives r@@ ise to more j@@ obs . 
This will ensure that local government has the correct management , administrative and technical skills .

We also visited various communities and municipalities , including B@@ al@@ four in Mp@@ umalanga and Th@@ emb@@ isa in G@@ auteng . 
The labour statistics released on T@@ u@@ es@@ day , show that the economy is now cre@@ ating j@@ obs rather than sh@@ ed@@ ding them . 
I have direc@@ ted the minis@@ ters to attend to the outstanding matters . 
A@@ noth@@ er key out@@ come is to ensure a long and heal@@ thy life for all South Africans . 
We have direc@@ ted law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies to take a t@@ oug@@ her st@@ ance on law@@ l@@ ess@@ ness in B@@ al@@ four and other areas . 
education , health , rural development and land re@@ form , cre@@ ating dec@@ ent work , and f@@ ighting crime . 
We have identified the fight against hij@@ acking , business and house robberies , as well as contact crimes such as murder , rap@@ e and assaul@@ t , as top prior@@ ities . 
We are building a perform@@ anc@@ e-@@ ori@@ ented state , by improv@@ ing planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation . 
Let us stop bu@@ ying stolen goods . 
We ur@@ ge parents to co@@ operate with us in making this a success . 
The work of departments will be meas@@ ured by outcomes , developed through our performance monitoring and evaluation system . 
Un@@ der@@ p@@ inning our strategy for economic rec@@ over@@ y and growth , is our capital investment programme . 
We will expec@@ t the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this v@@ ision . 
We said it would be a state that respond@@ s to the needs and as@@ pir@@ ations of the people , and which per@@ forms better and f@@ aster . 
We have also set amb@@ iti@@ ous targ@@ ets for skills development , to produce additional engine@@ ers and techn@@ ici@@ ans , and to increase the number of qualif@@ ied M@@ ath@@ ematic@@ s and Science teach@@ ers . 
We will re@@ in@@ state health programmes in schools . 
In addition , each of our 2@@ 7 000 schools will be ass@@ essed by officials from the Department of Bas@@ ic Education . 
We re@@ iter@@ ate that there are no gr@@ iev@@ ances that can jus@@ tify violence and the des@@ truc@@ tion of property . 
Municip@@ alities must improve the provision of housing , water , s@@ an@@ itation , electricity , waste management and roads . 
Am@@ ong other things , this will look at the participation of independent power produc@@ ers , and prot@@ ecting the poor from r@@ ising electricity pr@@ ices . 
The most urgent focus of policy change must be interventions to create j@@ obs for young people . 
Our long-@@ term infrastructure programme will help us gro@@ w f@@ aster . 
We all have a role to play . 
This action will ensure that women , children and persons with dis@@ abilities can access develop@@ mental opportunities . 
To stud@@ ents , we will provide eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use work@@ book@@ s in all 11 languages .

E@@ con@@ om@@ ic indic@@ ators sugg@@ est that we are now tur@@ ning the cor@@ ner .

We must also increase the number of youth who ent@@ er lear@@ nerships in the private and public sectors .

L@@ ast year we launched the National Y@@ outh Development Ag@@ ency . 
As you are aware , we are committed to five prior@@ iti@@ es: 
Our Indus@@ trial Pol@@ ic@@ y Ac@@ tion Pl@@ an and our new focus on gre@@ en j@@ obs , will build strong@@ er and more lab@@ our@@ -@@ ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing indus@@ tries . 
Let us participate in community safety for@@ ums . 
We plan to set as@@ ide over 6 000 h@@ ec@@ t@@ ar@@ es of well-@@ located public land for low@@ -@@ income and affor@@ d@@ able housing . 
This provided valu@@ able in@@ sig@@ ht into the challenges in local government . 
We aim to increase the p@@ ass rate for these t@@ ests from the current av@@ er@@ age of between 3@@ 5 and 4@@ 0@@ % to at least 6@@ 0@@ % by 20@@ 14 . 
A key new initi@@ ative will be to accommod@@ ate people whose sal@@ aries are too high to get government subsid@@ ies , but who ear@@ n too little to qualif@@ y for a normal bank mort@@ g@@ age . 
It is too soon , though , to be certain of the p@@ ace of rec@@ over@@ y . 
In our 20@@ 10 programme , we want to improve the ability of our children to read , wr@@ ite and coun@@ t in the fo@@ und@@ ation years . 
We will take further our work to reduce serious and viol@@ ent crimes , and ensure that the justice system works effici@@ ently . 
We are therefore making interventions to lower mater@@ nal mort@@ ality rates , to reduce new HIV inf@@ ections and to effec@@ tively tre@@ at HIV and t@@ ub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is . 
F@@ rom this year on@@ wards , all gr@@ ade 3 , 6 and 9 stud@@ ents will wr@@ ite lit@@ er@@ acy and n@@ um@@ er@@ acy t@@ ests that are indep@@ end@@ ently moder@@ ated . 
We aim to increase the number of mat@@ r@@ ic stud@@ ents who are elig@@ ible for un@@ iversity ad@@ mission to 1@@ 75 000 a year by 20@@ 14 . 
We have direc@@ ted the ag@@ ency to work f@@ aster to establish its structures , throughout the country , so that it can assist us to main@@ stre@@ am youth development programmes within government . 
We will set up a guaran@@ tee fund of R@@ 1 billion to inc@@ en@@ tiv@@ ise the private ban@@ king and housing sector , to develop new products to meet this housing dem@@ and . 
Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme , which will set the nor@@ ms and standards for public serv@@ ants in all s@@ pher@@ es . 
T@@ ogether with Br@@ az@@ il , Indi@@ a and China , and jo@@ ined by the United States , which represented the developed world , we made a significant contribution to the acc@@ ord adopted at the C@@ op@@ enh@@ ag@@ en C@@ lim@@ ate Ch@@ ange Summit in Dec@@ ember last year .

In this regard , we launched the first p@@ il@@ ot site of the Com@@ prehensive R@@ ural Development Programme in G@@ iy@@ ani , L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , in A@@ ug@@ ust last year . 
Our success in this area will be meas@@ ured by the increase in the number of sm@@ all@@ -@@ scale farm@@ ers that become econom@@ ically vi@@ able . 
We require excell@@ ence and hard work . 
Sin@@ ce then , 2@@ 3@@ 1 houses have been bu@@ ilt . 
We have sp@@ ent many years planning for this World Cup . 
We wish the L@@ OC Chairperson , Ir@@ v@@ in Kh@@ oza , CE@@ O D@@ ann@@ y J@@ ord@@ a@@ an and B@@ afana B@@ afana co@@ ach , Car@@ lo@@ s Al@@ ber@@ to Par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , all the best for the months ah@@ e@@ ad . 
We want 6@@ 0@@ % of hous@@ ehol@@ ds in these sites to meet their food requirements from own production by 20@@ 14 . 
As we celeb@@ rate Mad@@ ib@@ a's rel@@ ease today , we recomm@@ it our@@ selves to re@@ conciliation , national unity , non-@@ rac@@ i@@ alism and building a better future together as South Africans , black and white . 
Let us all bu@@ y tic@@ kets ti@@ me@@ ously to be able to attend the g@@ ames .
