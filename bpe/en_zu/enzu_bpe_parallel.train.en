Poverty alleviation and empowerment - through broad@@ ening participation in the economy and nar@@ rowing the gap between the first and second economy 
Province of 
the President himself to set the following goals for government at a national level@@ : 
do not have a represent@@ ational process . As a result , most of them are under@@ capit@@ alised , in the same way that a firm is under@@ capit@@ alised when it issues fewer securities than its income and assets would justify . 
The enterprises of the poor are very much like corporations that cannot issue shares or bonds to obtain new investments and finance . Without representations , their assets are dead capital . 
This is the mystery of capital 6 / 2 0 0 7 B U D G E T S P E E C H 
In the next five years the government will invest nationally more than R4@@ 00 billion in infrastructure to create jobs and fight poverty . 
In craf@@ ting the budget proposals , we went to great leng@@ ths to listen to the vo@@ ices of the people across the province , particularly the poor , disempowered , job@@ less and homeless . 
PRO@@ VIN@@ CE OF KWAZULU-NATAL 
The poor inhabitants of these nations the overwhelming majority do have things , but they lack the process to represent their property and create capital . 
Jour@@ ney to Pro@@ sper@@ ity 
These investments and interventions will occur under the ausp@@ ices of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa , the overall goal being to hal@@ ve poverty and unemployment by 2014 . 
Deputy Speaker 
But we were proud to announce that the journey had beg@@ un@@ ! This year the journey to prosperity for all in the province continues . There will be no change in direction or our end destination . 
In opening the National Parliament in 2005 , President Mbeki said , our country , as a united nation , has never in its entire history enjoyed such a con@@ flu@@ ence of encouraging possibilities .

In tabling the provincial budget for 2005/06 in March last year , we announced a comprehensive plan to transform the regional economy . This would be achieved through three main interven@@ tion@@ s: 
I am only m@@ erry for an hour or two upon a birth@@ day@@ :

As we enter into a new MTEF budget cycle , it is appropriate to report on the governments performance and progress in respect of these three interventions .

T@@ our@@ ism@@ -based development projects 
We noted the universal cr@@ y for jobs , decent housing , and access to basic services such as water , health care , electricity , etc . Three consistent themes raised by the community emerged during the road@@ show@@ s: 
PRO@@ G@@ RES@@ S RE@@ PORT ON BUDGET A@@ IM@@ S AND AC@@ HI@@ E@@ V@@ EMENTS IN 2005/06 
IN@@ TRO@@ DU@@ CTION OF THE PE@@ O@@ PL@@ ES BUDGET 2006 
This province will not lag behind in achieving these national developmental goals . Thus in this years budget there is an increase in funding for all votes , including that of basic services and infrastructure provision . 
The provincial government has achieved positive results in its efforts to grow the economy and to achieve sustainably higher growth rates , in partnership with the private sector . 
As we reflect on the year gone and focus on the dawn of a new year , I am reminded of the words of Alfred Lord Tennyson in his drama entitled THE F@@ O@@ RES@@ TE@@ RS when he said:

The President emphasised in his State of the Nation address two weeks ago that support for the small business sector and the development of cooperatives is a national priority and a key element of AS@@ G@@ ISA .

Many other government programmes support vulnerable households . Children who receive social assistance do not have to pay school fees . 
but is still healthy growth for a country such as South Africa . And most importantly , we will continue to invest for the future . 
Because of these constraints and because of the we@@ aker global environment , our economy is likely to slow down , growing at about 4 to 4 a year for the next three years .

Our economy has experienced its long@@ est period of economic expansion in over 50 years , growing by an average of 5 per cent a year for the last five years . Since 2001 , we have created about 1 .5 million jobs . 
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term capacity expansion includ@@ es: 
Due to growing electricity demand , Es@@ kom@@ s ag@@ eing plants are operated at maximum capacity , which often leads to equipment failures and less electricity available to the national grid that powers South Africa . 
Social grant increases and extension of our grant system 
Total tax relief for individuals of R7 .7 billion 
We are planning health and disaster management , event operations , safety and security , volunte@@ er training and recruitment , environmental rehabilitation and waste management , event communication , legacy and cultural activities . 
R@@ 12 billion more for social grants 
As a result , we have been able to provide more resources for education , health , social grants , housing , policing , public transport , stadiums , roads and prisons . 
R7 .6 billion more for public transport , roads and railway infrastructure 
In addition , a total of R9 billion is allocated to public transport projects related to the World Cup . 
The 2008 Budget also makes provision to phase in a reduction of the age of eligibility for men from 65 to 60 years - which is the same for women . 
Together with reduced capacity when plants are shut down for regular maintenance , this means that Eskom is not able to generate enough electricity to meet demand by households and industry . This results in power cuts . 
In 2008/09 , total spending on grants will increase to R6@@ 9 billion , which is 10 of total government spending .

As the economy has grown , we have come up against some limitations . The shortage of skilled people , insufficient electricity , 
This is slower than the past five years , 
traffic congestion and cement shortages are all signs that the economy is reaching its speed limit . To grow faster , we have to invest even more in skills , in infrastructure , in machinery and equipment , in roads and public transport .

Social grant increases for this year are as follows: 
Sp@@ ending highlights 
Construction of two g@@ as-@@ fired power plants - open cycle gas turb@@ ines in Mos@@ sel Bay and Atlantis . These will provide an additional MW . 
The foundation of our economy is strong and will be tested over the next year or two . With the right policies and hard work from all South Africans , 
R5 billion in tax subsidies set aside over the next five years to support investments in labour intensive industries and to support governments industrial policy 
In February of each year , the Minister of Finance announ@@ ces governments spending , tax and borrowing plans for the next three years . This is called the national budget . 
Because of rapid economic growth and proper management of the public finances , government spending has grown rapidly since 2001 , much faster than economic growth . 
A pack@@ et of 20 cigarettes will cost 66 cents more 
L@@ ong@@ -term capacity expansion includ@@ es: 
H@@ ost cities will also receive funding of R6@@ 84 million to conduct operations during the 2009 Confederations Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup . 
This makes South Africa one of the wor@@ l@@ ds biggest sp@@ enders on social grants . 
All children under the age of 6 are entitled to free primary health care . All beneficiaries of social grants who are not members of private medical aid schemes are fully subsidised to receive health services at public hospitals . 
Through getting better results from public spending and through higher levels of investment , we can lift our economy towards a growth rate of 6 . 
F@@ uel taxes will increase , as from 2 April 2008 , by 11 cents per litre 
Eskom has 26 power stations with the capacity to generate 37 7@@ 61 m@@ eg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity in total . However , only 35 4@@ 36 MW is normally available , with MW used exclusively during peak times . 
The child support grant grows from R200 to R2@@ 10 a month on 1 April 2008 , and from R2@@ 10 to R220 a month on 1 October 2008 
we can grow even faster and make a bigger difference to the lives of all of our people . 
Together , these investments will increase South Africas long-term capacity to provide power to homes and businesses . However , the electricity crisis also shows the need for all of us to conserve electricity and use it more efficiently . 
World economic growth is s@@ lowing down and there is more uncertainty in global markets . This year , the world economy is likely to grow more slowly than any time since 2001 .
