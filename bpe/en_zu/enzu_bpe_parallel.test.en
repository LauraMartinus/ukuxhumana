The improvement in employment figures over the last year , mor@@ e@@ over , is certainly partially attributable to the cooperatives initiative , which is already estimated to have attracted close to 35 000 individuals , 
The overwhelming success in the promotion of cooperatives and SMMEs means that our resources must be directed to support both cooperatives and SMMEs at district level . 
inter alia , a coordinated and efficiently implemented infrastructural investment programme , in which both government and the private sector will have major roles to play . 
In this regard I am also pleased to report very satisfactory progress over the last year@@ : 
In the forthcoming MTEF , r@@ ing-@@ fenced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job creation , poverty relief and black economic empowerment . These programmes are the following: 
 this strategy in turn is aligned to the national Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative . The ration@@ ale behind this approach is simpl@@ e: 
Empowerment initiatives 
A further 5 high profile cases of fraud and corruption involving syndicates are under investigation , and we have joined forces with the Directorate of Special Operations and As@@ set For@@ fe@@ iture Unit in order to secure successful prosecutions . 
Mr Speaker , in last years address I alluded to the fact that we will not attain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty alleviation programmes 
 the Office of the Premier will be responsible for coordinating the soccer development programme across the departments involved . 
into the second phase of development by establishing secondary and tertiary cooperatives . El@@ even secondary coops will be set@@ up in each of the district municipalities and metro , 
pre-@@ qualified bidders that are techn@@ ically , financially and legally qualified and meet the empowerment criteria , 
Such practices have to become far more efficient , ensuring that administrative delays do not place un@@ bear@@ able cash@@ flow burden on the SMMEs . 
In terms of employment , according to the Stats SA Labour Force Survey , in 2004 9@@ 93 ,@@ 000 people in the province were unemployed - this declined to 9@@ 87 ,@@ 000 in 2005 , 
The reforms in our asset and supply chain management systems and policies are proceeding on track and are set to greatly improve efficiencies in the way we procure and account for goods and services and physical assets . 
The land at La Merc@@ y to be sold to the province . 
World Cup stadium development 
The intention is to provide a brid@@ ging programme , a one year certificate , a two year diploma and a three year degree in cooperatives and business management practice . 
Some of the cases are before the courts of law and misconduct enquiries are also being handled by respective departments . 
Both Ithala and the Provincial Government conc@@ ede that this demand for finance cannot be met by Ithala alone . 
for emerging contractors aimed at promoting and supporting affirm@@ able business and equity in the civil and building contractor sector . It comprises a six@@ -@@ st@@ aged advancement programme with contract value limits determined by experience , training and capacity . 
Given the huge deal flow which the initial SMME fund managed by Ithala has already generated , the Head of Treasury was tasked to develop a scheme 
which will then enter into contr@@ actual agreements with ACSA to manage and operate the airport and with the selected bid@@ der from the private sector to design and construct the facility . 
amounting to approximately R6@@ bn in 2005/06 , to stimulate growth in the SMME sector and to advance black economic empowerment generally . 
POLICY PR@@ IOR@@ I@@ TI@@ ES FOR THE 2006/07 MTEF 
The focus will be on dissemination of information and giving guidance to women , youth and the disabled . 
The relocation of Durban International Airport when King Shaka International is operational in 2009 ; and 
Draft legislation establishing the DTP has been prepared and will be submitted to this Legislature in March . I appeal to Honourable Members to ensure that this Bill is dealt with within the strict time@@ frames we have set ourselves . 
As I mentioned , this year we will also be instituting a new co-@@ financing model to support the growth of the small business sector in the province . 
An important part of governments infrastructure-@@ related strategic investment programme for the medium term is the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone . 
if economic growth can be step@@ ped up to average 4 ,5 over the next five years , and 6 from 2009 to 2014 , th@@ en@@ : 
to empower them so as to be capable of running viable commercial enterprises . This means that secondary coops will need to possess skills in financial management , 
We are propos@@ ing to alloc@@ ate R3@@ 1@@ m , R8@@ 9m and R1@@ 39 ,5m over the MTEF period as a contribution to the building of soccer stadium infrastructure in the province . 
A special training unit has been created in collaboration with the University of Z@@ ululand to train managers and members of coops and to develop careers in the field . 
with the main functions of providing support to primary cooperatives , which are by design production units . The intention is to ensure that primary cooperatives get support from secondary and tertiary cooperatives , 
This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs , 
which will together with the Department of Sport and Recreation play a coordinating role in assisting the District Municipalities of Amajuba , Ugu , uM@@ g@@ ungundlovu and uTh@@ ung@@ ulu 
In the area of governance and risk management , quarterly summary reports on the risk profile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet . 
A contract is being concluded with the NSIC team of consultants , who will be based in the province for 10 weeks , and who will work with a team from Treasury and Economic Development . 
marketing and general business management . For technical skills secondary coops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required expertise and for private sector wishing to do business with this sector . 
The Dube TradePort Section 21 Company will have to be converted into a statutory public entity under the PFMA that is empowered to establish King Shaka International Airport Special Purpose Vehicle , 
Against this background , what are the governments expenditure priorities for the new MTEF budget cycle commencing in six week@@ s? 
including the provision and loan of capital equipment , on a day to day basis and are not depend@@ ant on government support permanently . Support will be given to secondary coops 
E@@ CON@@ OM@@ I@@ C S@@ NA@@ PS@@ HO@@ T 
inter alia through the bargaining mus@@ cle it will acquire over the control of resources and markets through the sheer scale of its operations , with benefits flowing to members of the cooperatives . 
The fl@@ ag@@ ship Dube TradePort project incorporating a state of the art Airport in King Shaka International has made solid progress and we are on track to achieve our deadline for the project to be operational by 2009 . 
Our quest to narrow the gap between the first and second economies will continue to be a central feature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as bar@@ bed wire , ceramic tiles , agri-@@ food products , building materials , paper products etc ; 
will deal with each of these three policy priority areas in turn . 
allowing time in the first year of the MTEF for the stakeholders to finalise the business case , funding model and ownership arrangements . 
I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term consistency in the budget policy framework and direction to achieve maximum impact over time . 
The equipment and professional expertise provided by the NSIC will be used to support the growth and development of small medium and micro enterprises in the province , including cooperatives at both the primary and secondary level . 
Co-@@ financing strategy 
The intention 
and an electronic system to perform the acquisition stage of S@@ C@@ M , namely the sourcing of Quotations and Tenders this project will both improve efficiencies and turn@@ around times as well as help to eliminate fraud and corruption . 
Our proposal is to set aside R20 million , R200 million and R1 ,5 billion over the 2006/07 MTEF years for this project this is over and above the R100m already in this years budget for the Trade Port . 
I have alluded to the successes already attained in establishing primary cooperatives around the province in the last year . This year we intend to move the cooperatives programme 
But hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come Wh@@ isper@@ ing it will be happier ; 
for financing business applications from primary cooperatives will be aug@@ mented by allocations of R100m , R1@@ 87@@ m and R2@@ 17@@ m over the 2006/07 MTEF these funds will be managed by the Department of Economic Development . 
In reviewing its policy priorities for the new MTEF period , the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the goal of placing the province on a sustainably higher growth path a central part of its economic development strategy 
In the March budget address a year ago it was emphasized that government intended to use its procurement spend on goods and services , 
As the DTP will no longer be established as a PP@@ P , the R100m allocated to the project in this years budget will be ro@@ uted via Ithala to facilitate site preparation work including site acquisition , perimeter f@@ encing , 
This does not mean that we will be negl@@ ecting the need for continued support for primary cooperatives . The initial allocation of R110m to Ithala in the current financial year 
This investment will stimulate economic development along these nodes and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
ACSA to acquire a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a concession within or after the 10 year term ; 
This is a significant development , as h@@ enc@@ e@@ forth governance and risk management issues cutting across all departments will be highlighted at an executive level . 
This pressure on Ithala is a refl@@ ection that in SMME finance for the disadvantaged , Ithala is the institution of choice . 
In terms of overall economic growth , according to Stats SA KwaZulu-Natal recorded a growth rate of 4 ,9 in 2004 , second only to the Western Cape at 5 ,3 and above the national growth rate of 4 ,5 
Establishment of secondary cooperatives 
which we hope to conclude by December 2006 . Award of the contract will follow and it is expected that main construction will commence in March 2007 , with facilities to be completed and operational by October 2009 . 
But some of you might leg@@ iti@@ mat@@ ely ask whether all these government interventions have had a measurable effect on improving the economic performance of the province . 
The Dube TradePort as a statutory public entity will be mandated to drive the trade zone development , the cy@@ ber@@ port , the agricultural zone and other associated commercial developments . 
Before the end of June the Department of Economic Development will convene a conference involving representatives of all municipalities to discuss common and coordinated approach to Local Economic Development . 
We must realise that we are do@@ oming the cooperatives and SMMEs we are establishing to failure from the outset unless we follow through by facilitating access to government procurement on a sustainable basis . 
The University of KwaZulu-Natal will also be approached on a similar basis . 
Just to what extent these impressive growth and employment figures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficult to quan@@ tify at this stage . 
 we are of the un@@ sh@@ ak@@ eable view that 
To this end , we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year . 
Many people in the izimbizo reported delays in getting approval this is simply due to the large volumes of applications . 
Although we have indeed made progress in addressing the central challenges of poverty , unemployment and service backlogs in the past year , much remains to be done in the short , medium and long term . 
Criminal investigations , which will eventually lead to prosecution , are being conducted by the Special Investigation Unit , a division of the National Prosecuting Authority . 
It will apply to both civil engineering works such as airports , run@@ ways , bridges , roads etc , as well as general building works . 
which has more than fifty years experience in promoting the growth of small scale industries and business enterprises . We are exploring two areas of cooperation with the NS@@ IC@@ : 
The SE@@ D@@ As will work in collaboration with Ithala and the Department of Economic Development to provide support services at district level 
and finance , real estate and business services , which grew at 7 ,9 . The manufacturing sector grew at a healthy rate of 4 ,5 . 
 and failure to meet the deadline is not an option then all role-players will have to play their part , including this Legislature . 
but that BE@@ E-@@ owned companies and emerging contractors enjoy maximum benefit from the contracts put out to tender . Treasury has accordingly developed a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed infrastructure procurement policy 
We remain determined therefore to fulfil our obligations to the taxpay@@ ing citizens of this country by maintaining and indeed improving our high standards in the field of financial management and good governance . 
Treasury took an unprecedented move to engage lawyers to op@@ pose court applications against the Department of Social Welfare , and that sav@@ ed millions of rands while it uncovered a scam which was dr@@ aining funds destined for the poor . 
Mr Speaker , Honourable Members , I must stress that if the deadline for the project to be operational by 2009 is to be met 
and other irregularities , amounting to the loss of tens of millions of rands in various departments , public entities and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year . 
in such a way that governments BEE policy and objectives are met . I expect in the coming year to be able to report actual expenditure figures per department on procurement from BEE companies , SMMEs and cooperatives . 
unless at the same time we focus as a government on improving efficiencies and achieving better value for the vast sums of money we spend on these programmes . 
May I remind you again of the words of Alfred lord Tennyson who said: 
We propose to set aside R@@ 90 million and R100 million in 2007@@ /08 and 2008/09 respectively for development of the IDZ , 
In the MTEF period , therefore , funding allocations of R50 , R55m and R6@@ 0m have been set aside for the development of soccer at all levels in the province in collaboration with SAFA 
with a tol@@ l free number to assist with queries . This will be set up by April this year . 
Progress was also made in enforcing our policy of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption . Six high profile investigations into fraud , corruption , theft , mis@@ management , maladministration 
I can say with some confidence that the programmes and economic sectors being prioritised by government , with one or two exceptions , appear to be yiel@@ ding positive results in terms of performance and trends over the last two years . 
In respect of Performance Bud@@ g@@ eting System , the rollout of the system in departments is proceeding on schedule , and demonstration data bases have been installed in Provincial Treasury , Health and Transport . 
that will bring banks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of SMMEs in the Province , thereby rel@@ iev@@ ing the pressure on Ithala . 
The balance of funds required will have to come from debt financing . The Development Bank has already agreed in principle to provide debt funding secured against revenue streams of the project up to R500m . 
income per capita will rise by 50 in the next ten years , and the rate of unemployment will be hal@@ ved . 
In this regard , government has identified several key projects and programmes as priorities for the forthcoming MTEF . These can be summar@@ ised as follows: 
It is un@@ realistic however , to expect that the provincial economy will launch itself onto a higher growth path on its own accord . A structural growth accel@@ eration of this magnitude will require , 
We have secured a legally binding Mo@@ U with ACSA and the National Minister of Transport providing for: 
Site preparation and installation of back@@ bone infrastructure is expected to commence by the end of the calendar year . 
The challenge facing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within planned time@@ frames , 
and the commissioning of a study by a team of NSIC experts to review the current mechanisms , legislation and policies in the province designed to support SMMEs in the province . 
It is often heard that lengthy delays occur in paying the SMMEs 
When President Mbeki said: Clearly the masses of our people are convinced that our country has entered into its age of Hope , I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say SI@@ Y@@ A@@ VUMA . 
based on an average of 9 people per cooperative many of these have already found employment through their cooperatives or are likely to do so in the near future . 
to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camps . We are also of the view however that we need not just to build soccer stadium infrastructure , but also the sport itself in the province . 
Discus@@ sions are also in progress on the financing model for the Trade Port . The total investment required for the airport , which is part of the Trade Port , is about R2 .5 billion over the next four to five years . 
70 at Social Welfare ; 23 at Home Affairs ; 3 ,9@@ 79 in other departments ; and 15 medical doctors and agents were impl@@ icated . 
back@@ bone infrastructure out@@ lay and the development of the N@@ 2 inter@@ change . The tenders for this initial site preparation and technical work have already closed and are currently being adjud@@ icated . 
once again well above the national average , and close to the AS@@ G@@ I-@@ SA target of 6 . 
The provincial budget will accordingly continue to play a key role as policy instrument to address the socioeconomic challenges confronting us . 
This is concrete proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empowerment . 
Funding in the amount of R5@@ 0m , R55m and R@@ 60 ,5m has been allocated to the Department of Economic Development for the establishment of secondary and tertiary cooperatives in the MTEF period . 
We have undertaken to cooperate with and assist the South African Women Entrepreneur@@ s in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry . 
This IDZ was pro@@ claimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 2002 . Since then , however , there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure out@@ l@@ ays required to make the IDZ work . 
to select at least 2 , but no more than 3 
stimulating economic growth through coordinated infrastructure investment , creating jobs and allev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy , and expansion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery . 
and that have sufficient experience and resources 
INTE@@ RV@@ EN@@ TION TH@@ RE@@ E@@ : Val@@ ue for money and good governance initiatives 
It is surely no co@@ incidence , however , that growth in the construction sector is sur@@ ging , given the provincial governments increased expenditure on infrastructure tot@@ alling R7 ,@@ 42 bn over the last two years . 
In this regard , I have tasked the Treasury with establishing a small unit to focus on fast-@@ tracking of payments to cooperatives and SMMEs , 
Sec@@ tors in the province which experienced particularly strong growth in 2004 were construction , which grew at a stagg@@ ering 28 ,8 , 
As at the end of December 2005 , Ithala had approved 40@@ 5 SMME business plans worth R4@@ 33 million . Of this amount over R1@@ 79 million has already been dis@@ bur@@ sed . 
In April 2006 a detailed Request for Proposals will be issued to selected bidders to prepare more detailed b@@ ids . By September 2006 a bid@@ der will be selected and detailed negotiations will commence , 
During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R@@ 200m to Ithala to drive the SMME programme for the province pending the finalisation of a structured SMME Fund . 
A provincial supply chain management framework policy has been compiled to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to procure goods and services , including from cooperatives , 
In the coming year therefore , we are going to be implementing a new programme to support SMMEs the details of which I will reveal shortly . 
It should come as no surprise therefore , that the budget expenditure proposals for 2006/07 recommended by Cabinet can be categor@@ ized into three broad areas which are consistent with the themes which underpinned last years budget , nam@@ el@@ y: 
for services rendered and/or supplies provided . 
The consequence of this is the need to expand the Department of Economic Development , with more staff employed to provide support centres in all districts in collaboration with municipal initiatives and to strengthen Local Economic Development . 
and the anticipated savings are as follows: R9 ,4@@ m savings per month ; R1@@ 13@@ m savings per ann@@ um and R3@@ 38@@ m savings over a 3 year period . Furthermore a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspec@@ ts: 
- this compar@@ es to a growth rate for KZN in 2003 of just 2 ,8 . In 2005 KZ@@ N@@ s economic growth rate is projected to be in the region of 5 ,2 , 
We have welcomed the launch of Small Enterpr@@ ise Development Agency as a brand of DT@@ I to support SMMEs and coops . 
improving the unemployment rate from 33 .1 in 2004 to 31 .8 in 2005 . This decrease in unemployment was in fact faster than the national average , which declined from 27 .9 to 26 .5 over the same period . 
Cre@@ ating jobs and allev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy 
During the year we invested R@@ 80 million in the social welfare grants investigation which has yiel@@ ded tremendous value to the province . 25 ,9@@ 56 fraudulent grants were identified in this investigation 
The deal flow that is currently under consideration by Ithala is standing at R1 .5@@ bn . It is safe to suggest that between R500m to R1@@ bn of those deals would be worthy of funding . 
As importantly , the payment process to SMMEs by Government Departments leaves much to be desired . 
 this will have a positive impact on the revival of Ul@@ undi as a regional centre . 
A tertiary cooperative will provide support to cooperatives through ap@@ ex level institutions . It will also advocate and engage organs of state , the private sector and the stakeholders on behalf of its members . 
The second major infrastructure-@@ related programme being advanced by the provincial government relates to financial support for the development of soccer stadiums in the province in preparation for the 2010 World Cup . 
is that the tertiary cooperative should manage the entire value chain , 
only by upl@@ ifting the masses struggling to survive in the second economy will we be able to achieve sustainably higher growth rates over the longer term , and hence our end-@@ goal of prosperity for all . 
The growth of cooperatives requires a major shift in our strategy . Co@@ ops are a community movement . For sustainability we need to institution@@ alise the cooperatives movement . 
Other infrastructure-@@ related strategic projects we propose to fund over the 2006/07 MTEF period are the two road corridors leading to Richards Bay , namely the L@@ ubombo SD@@ I corridor and the P@@ 700 linking to Ul@@ undi and ultimately Vry@@ he@@ id . 
Of the approved business plans to date , 3@@ 28 involve female only cooperatives , 2@@ 35 youth , 1@@ 25 male and 96 mixed cooperatives . 
Contin@@ u@@ ed support for small business development 
nor crowd out emerging loan capital , but to complement the existing off@@ erings and provide loan options for those entrepreneurs and small businesses who are presently unable to access affordable loan finance due to a range of factors . 
The full details of the exact nature , purpose and governance framework for the Fund will be set out in the Information Memorandum for the KZN SMME Fund . 
Access to research and technical support for better production processes . 
The business partners and financial institutions who participate in the Fund will by agreement access the existing SMME deal flow generated by Ithala . 
to address the whole agricultural value chain , including marketing , transport , processing , packaging and br@@ anding , the provision of technical advice , and support to emerging farmers through the loan of tractors , impl@@ ements and equipment . 
the USA , the Middle East and Asia . Another objective is 
The initial contribution of R@@ 200m from government in the first year of the MTEF will be followed by allocations of R2@@ 20@@ m and R2@@ 4@@ 2@@ m in the outer two years . 
SM@@ AL@@ L B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S AR@@ ISE@@ !@@ !@@ ! 
Agr@@ arian revolution 
The focus of agrarian revolution projects and interventions will be on boos@@ ting the capacity of secondary agricultural cooperatives at the district level 
It must be emphasised that the agrarian revolution concept is not only about agriculture . It embraces the whole spectrum of development of our rural areas , 
Applicants who have applied to Ithala for loans should not be surprised therefore if their deals end up being financed by another financial institution 
ABSA has already indicated a willingness to commit R2@@ 5m to funding small and micro enterprises ne@@ eding loan finance of less than R3 million . We are also at advanced stages of discussions with Standard Bank and First National . 
This document will form the basis for the participation of any other financial institution in the Fund . 
Access to markets 
Discus@@ sions with FNB have not been finalised . Together with a provincial government contribution of R@@ 200m which we will make available , the intention is to leverage total funding of over R1 ,5 bn for the SMME Fund by June 2006 . 
Our message is: 
The Fund is designed as a central component of a small enterprise lending framework , which seeks not to comp@@ ete with other commercial SMME l@@ enders in the market , 
 the important thing is that all SMME business loan applications will be attended to within the coming year . 
Note that the funds will be held against the V@@ ote of the Provincial Treasury pending disbursement to the SMME Fund . 
The objective is to develop the provinces enormous potential in agriculture into a competitive advantage by util@@ ising all of its 590 bio-@@ resource regions to produce vegetables , fruit and meat products for export to Europe , 
A dramatic reduction in farming input costs 
Standard Bank has indicated that subject to agreement on governance arrangements , they will make available R2@@ 5@@ 0m for the financing of SMMEs applying for finance between R3@@ m and R3@@ 0m . 
Another key second economy intervention is that of the agrarian revolution , whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to move subsistence farmers upwards towards the first economy . 
Business Part@@ ners in collaboration with Khula , will work with Ithala to open access to Ithala applicants to the R1@@ 5@@ 0m start up capital for SMME and BEE funding . 
Access to support for land reform beneficiaries , and 
to reduce the reliance on the importation of basic fo@@ od@@ st@@ uff@@ s and to bring down food prices through a comprehensive support programme for emerging farmers which will facilit@@ ate: 
Division of revenue framework and revised provincial allocations over the MTEF 
demonstrating governments ongoing commitment to improving the quality and reach of education . The budget includes additional funding in 
'@@ n Ensuring the viability of the land restitution process , through the facilitation of viable programmes for such areas 
and is a first step towards al@@ ig@@ ning service delivery provision between the local and provincial spheres of government . 
The Department of Community Safety & Liaison receives R50 ,8 million this year , an increase of 5 .5 per cent . As the department received a substantial additional allocation last year , there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget . 
Parliament receives R1@@ 39 ,2 million , an increase of 7 .6 per cent over the previous year , including an additional allocation over baseline of R1@@ 5 ,7 million 
for EM@@ IS , the National Curr@@ iculum Statement , AB@@ ET , FET Colleges and the introduction of the no fee schools policy . 
the provision for government employees medical scheme to cover those civil servants not covered by medical aid , and the phasing in of the food relief 
Education is allocated a budget of R1@@ 6 ,@@ 20@@ 9 billion . The 2006/07 budget represents an increase of 11 .7 per cent over last year , 
which provides access to markets 
and anti@@ fraud and corruption measures aimed at stream@@ lining the drivers and learners licence system . Note that the department receives very substantial increases in this budget in the outer two years of the MTEF . 
This includes additional funding in the amount of R@@ 70 million for maintenance , new road works and access bridges , 
In particular , the unit will work closely with the Department of Economic Development , the Regional Offices of the Land Claims Commission and Land Affairs , and other provincial departments 
Agriculture and Environmental Affairs receives R1 ,@@ 299 billion , an increase of 24 .2 per cent . 
Includ@@ ed in this allocation is additional funding in the amount of R3@@ 1@@ m for coordinating the provision of soccer st@@ ad@@ ia infrastructure in District Municipalities and the Metro , 
There is a growing need for government to intervene in the second economy through our instrument for economic empowerment , Ithala . While much has been achieved in the last year 
Note that all funding in the Poverty Al@@ leviation Fund has been allocated to specific departments , while specific allocations have also been made to various departments 
Establishment of accelerated economic development unit within Ithala 
I turn now to the expenditure proposals . In line with established practice and sound financial principles , the province is aim@@ ing at a balanced budget for the 2006/07 financial year 
In respect of the total budget allocations for the 2006/07 financial year@@ : 
Over and above this , most departments will be receiving additional funding over the MTEF for specific purposes and projects , as indicated in Table 3 in the printed speech . 
with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the 20 major land restitution projects around the province . A Task Team coordinated by the Economic Technical Cluster of Cabinet has already been established 
Treasury has engaged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate model for the planning , coordination , and approval of the agrarian revolution projects . 
while service delivery issues and capacity constraints are also addressed in the budget proposals . 
An amount of R@@ 40m will be allocated to the Department of Economic Development in the 2006/07 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit . 
R2@@ 80 million for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure ; 
R5@@ 0m of this increased allocation is earmarked for the establishment of secondary coops , R100m for primary coops , R3@@ 0m for the inc@@ ubator programme , 
Trans@@ ports budget of R2 ,4@@ 16 billion in 2006/07 is an increase of 9 .9 per cent over last year . 
R110 million to strengthen the FET colleges ; and 
Inv@@ esting in revival of township economies 
The budget proposals will simultaneously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment , job creation , poverty alleviation , and broader participation in the economy 
from communities and interest groups across the province we are left with the firm impression that this is truly a budget for the people by the people of the province . 
Note that the amounts per project are the total sum over the three years of the 2006/07 MTEF period . It should also be noted that 
Given the limited resources , substantial re@@ prioritiz@@ ation and tr@@ ade@@ offs had to be made this is of course the essence of what the budgeting process is all about . 
is the single most important impedim@@ ent to viability and sustainability , and this aspect will be a major focus area of Ith@@ al@@ as Accelerated Economic Development Unit and the other role-players mentioned . 
Ithala is therefore in the process of establishing a new business unit called Accelerated Economic Development Unit , which will facilitate delivery in the following are@@ as@@ : 
The Department of Sport & Recreation is allocated a budget of R@@ 106 ,1 million , a 19 .3 per cent increase over last year . 
and requires a high degree of coordination and cooperation between various provincial departments and district municipalities . The Department of Trans@@ ports African Renaissance Road Upgrading Programme , 
Once again Minister T@@ rev@@ or Man@@ uel and the Team Finance have provided invaluable advice and guidance on the technical issues and national budget framework which underpin this budget . 
As explained this decrease is attributable to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget . The department nevertheless receives 
Facilitation of new investment and increased trade within the Province 
However , the quality of information received from departments in their budget submissions in terms of their spatial spending and service delivery gaps was relatively incomplete and inadequate . 
The budg@@ eted revenue for 2006/07 is made up as follows: 
the provincial budget actually grows by 13 .4 per cent over last years main budget , again excluding the social security grant funding . This is not an in@@ considerable increase , 
In his medium term budget policy statement , the Minister of Finance tabled the division of revenue between the three government spheres . 
There are many people who contributed to the budget proposals which we table today . The support provided by the Premier Hon J@@ S Ndebele and my Cabinet Col@@ leag@@ ues is most sincerely appreciated . 
Total funding request by departments 
will be collectively spending no less than R3@@ bn over the forthcoming MTEF on combating HIV and AIDS , including the further expansion and rollout of the P@@ MT@@ C@@ T , anti@@ retroviral and home-based care programmes 
Ex@@ pan@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery 
Health is allocated a budget of R11 ,7@@ 37 billion , an increase of 13 .1 per cent . This relatively large percentage increase reflects the high priority which government , both national and provincial , 
but Hope smiles at the threshold of the year to come whisper@@ ing , it will be happier The 2006/07 Provincial budget process 
For the 2006/07 MTEF , a total of R9 ,7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments . This is against a total of R4 ,6 billion available in the provincial resource envelope . 
In short , I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proceed , on schedule , along our journey to prosperity for all . 
Economic Development gets R3@@ 90 ,1 million in 2006/07 , a 17@@ 7 per cent increase over last year . Before I am accused of ne@@ pot@@ ism , let me draw attention to the fact that 
who have once again have played a most constructive role in engaging with Treasury on budgetary and financial management issues . 
KZ@@ N@@ s share of additional funding 
The third area which government is prioritising in this budget relates to expanding and improving the quality of existing programmes and projects . Of note are the following alloc@@ ations: 
and outer two years of the MTEF period . The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 2005/06 financial year , namely R@@ 37 ,@@ 19@@ 2 billion , is allocated to the various provincial departments . 
Before Honourable Members become al@@ armed , however , I should explain that the decrease is entirely attributable to the removal of the social security conditional grant funding from the provincial budgets al@@ together 
This exercise revealed that indeed we are funding these national priorities more than adequately , and all the national priority programmes have been allocated healthy increases in their baseline budgets over the 2006/07 MTEF . 
in accordance with their legislative mand@@ ates and any sector-specific norms and standards . 
It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget submissions . If nothing else , this approach has brought about a change in the mindset of departments 
For the 2006/07 financial year , the province is budgeting for total revenue of R@@ 37 ,@@ 19@@ 1 billion . This represents a decrease of 18 ,4 per cent as compared to last years main budget . 
EPWP and B@@ B@@ BEE principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and maint@@ en@@ anc@@ e-related projects . 
This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department , in the amount of R@@ 18 ,9 million , as well as R4@@ m for the carr@@ y-@@ through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate . 
R2@@ 90 million for Adult Basic Education & Training ; 
in terms of the number of new entrepreneurs entering the market , there is a need to create better focus within Ithala in order to accelerate delivery in this all important empowerment initiative . 
The Royal Hous@@ ehold receives R@@ 31 ,4 million in 2006/07 , an increase of 13 .8 per cent over last year . 
to R13 ,8@@ 32 bn in 2006/07 compared to R@@ 12 ,7@@ 71 bn in the current year . 
additional funding tot@@ alling R@@ 97 ,5m as a result of the phasing in of the F@@ ood Relief and HIV and AIDS grants . Although not in our budget the conditional grant for social assistance grants 
I am confident however that we have succeeded in form@@ ulating budget proposals which truly reflect the provincial policy priorities as approved by the provincial executive , and will go a long way towards satisf@@ ying the aspirations of popular expectations . 
and the HIV and AIDS conditional grants into the equitable share . For 2006/07 , R3@@ 97 million is available for discre@@ tionary spending , rising to R3 .2 billion in 2008/09 . 
shows an increase 
The number of beneficiaries in year 200@@ 0@@ /0@@ 1 was 6@@ 21 ,4@@ 94 compared to 1 ,8@@ 36 ,9@@ 75 in year 2004@@ /0@@ 5 . 
for the carr@@ y-@@ through costs of the Ad@@ j@@ ustments Estim@@ ate allocations last year , and R9 ,5m and R6 ,7@@ m for catering for cultural affairs and office administrative costs respectively . 
R58 million to develop communal agricultural infrastructure ; 
The social services are once again prioritised in terms of the growth rates in their MTEF allocations , 
The purpose of this spatial exercise was to move towards att@@ aining a comprehensive economic alignment strategy for the province , by trying to identify provincial departments spending 
for coordinating soccer development in the province in collaboration with SAFA , as well the additional allocations already referred to for extra capacity in the executive council secretarial services , 
cane and timber production become viable and sustainable in as short a time as possible . Without excep@@ tion , the lack of loan financing for the initial cap@@ italisation of the projects 
the amount of R1@@ 35 million 
from the Provincial Growth Fund for strategic provincial projects such as the Dube Trade Port , Richards Bay IDZ and infrastructure for the 2010 Soccer World Cup . 
Note the additional allocations made in the two outer years of the MTEF for the establishment of sporting and recreation facilities . 
The Department of Social Welfare and Pop@@ ulations budget dec@@ reases from R13 ,@@ 60@@ 5 bn last year to R8@@ 9@@ 5m a decrease of no less than 93 .4 per cent . 
The unit will create capacity to deliver on the above areas and thus realising government objectives of reducing poverty and unemployment . 
RE@@ V@@ EN@@ UE AND EX@@ P@@ END@@ IT@@ URE PROPO@@ SAL@@ S: 2006/07 
R2@@ 79 million to improve maintenance of hospitals . 
to ensure that all the national priorities in the fields of education , health care , social welfare services and EPWP programmes were adequately funded . 
and service delivery gaps within a given spatial area . Ul@@ tim@@ ately , Treasury would like to compile a profile per district municipality on services provided by provincial departments , 
Pro@@ posed additional allocations to the Office of the Premier will strengthen the secretarial services to the Executive Council , and other provincial committees . 
R@@ 10m for corridor development , and a R1@@ 5 ,8@@ m allocation to meet the costs of the incorporation of Um@@ zim@@ khulu into KwaZulu-Natal . 
Promotion of commercial , as well as viable subsistence farming in previously disadvantaged communities 
Mr Speaker , I turn now to the detail of the provincial budget proposals for the 2006/07 MTEF . 
Mr Speaker , we remain committed for example to continue w@@ aging a relentless campaign to combat the rav@@ aging effects of the HIV and AIDS syn@@ dr@@ ome on our society . To this end provincial departments 
And demanding , because putting budgets together , which involves making informed choices and mat@@ ching limited resources against competing needs and demands , is never an easy process . 
for the carr@@ y- through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate , new posts and IT support and systems . 
I also wish to extend my thanks to the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Portfolio Committee , Mr C@@ yr@@ il X@@ aba and his Committee , 
Mr Speaker , compiling these budget proposals has been both a pleas@@ urable and demanding task . P@@ le@@ as@@ urable , in that there has been tremend@@ ously positive input and advice received 
R2@@ 9m for the Community Development Workers programme , R24 ,1 million for Project Con@@ solid@@ ate , Dis@@ aster Management Centres and the Rural Con@@ nec@@ tivity Programme , 
The Housing budget records a substantial le@@ ap to R1 ,@@ 2@@ 52 billion , an increase of no less than 29 .1 per cent over last year . 
and there is little doubt that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliver on its mandate to the elec@@ torate . 
 this funding has been transferred to the newly established Social Security Agency at a national level . T@@ aking out the social security grant funding of some R13 ,8@@ bn in 2006/07 , 
The Department of Works receives R4@@ 51 ,5 million this year , an increase of 6 .@@ 0 per cent over the 2005/06 budget . 
This includes additional funding of R110m as mentioned for the agrarian revolution programme , 
The main reason for the decrease is that Treasury will no longer have the centralised Poverty Al@@ leviation Fund held against its budget , 
The Provincial Treasury receives R1 ,@@ 0@@ 69 billion , a nomin@@ al decrease of 1 .8 per cent over last years main budget . 
The primary focus of the 2006/07 Treasury Guidelines was on the review and re@@ prioritisation of departments budgets , as well as on an analysis of their spatial spending and service delivery in each district municipality . 
The expenditure framework provides for R@@ 31 billion in additional equitable share allocation to the provinces over the MTEF . 
while even the balance of the Provincial Growth Fund and SMME Fund will only be housed in T@@ reas@@ ur@@ ys budget on a temporary basis , pending approval of projects and consequ@@ ent transfer of funds to the Ithala 
 this is the total expenditure across the Departments of Health , Social Welfare and Education . The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty alleviation programmes in their respective budget documentation . 
The Department of Arts , Culture and Tourism receives a budget of R2@@ 54 ,7 million , a 21 .6 per cent increase over last year . This includes an additional allocation of R@@ 18 ,7 million 
with the mandate to ensure that the commercial enterprises earmarked for the major land restitution projects such as game farming and ecotourism , 
R@@ 40m for the Accelerated Development Unit in Ithala , and R@@ 20@@ m for the Dube Trade Port . Pre@@ viously these funds were kept in Treasury before they were transferred to Ithala . 
Mr Speaker , I have dealt at length with the major policy priorities and therefore I wish to briefly explain the division of revenue and MTEF framework which underp@@ ins this provincial budget . 
The Office of the Premier is allocated R 29@@ 4 ,7 million , an increase of 35 .1 per cent over the 2005/06 budget . This large increase is mainly attributable to an allocation of R5@@ 0m 
The Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs gets R5@@ 95 ,6 million , a 29 .9 per cent increase . 
Other key role-players include the Departments of Economic Development , Housing , Arts , Culture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land Claims Commission . 
We are also recomm@@ ending additional allocations in order to help departments increase their internal capacity and improve service delivery . 
continues to accord to the delivery of social services , and includes an additional allocation of R24 ,6 million for improving maintenance in hospitals . 
Mr Speaker , I want to emphasise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for allocation should be ap@@ por@@ tioned among departments and programmes , we did a comprehensive cos@@ ting and bench@@ marking exercise 
Exp@@ end@@ iture proposals and departmental allocations 
This allocation will also support the regulatory activities of the G@@ amb@@ ling Board . A request from the Department of Housing for additional capacity has also been recommended to support various initiatives such as training of housing beneficiaries . 
Table 1 in the printed speech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further allocation , taking into account projected provincial own revenue and two national policy directives ;

We all have a role to play in making sure money is not wasted by any of our civil servants . We must comb@@ ine our efforts in working together toward our economic recovery . 
Despite governments best efforts , meeting the needs of all South Africans will be t@@ ougher over the period ahead . Government officials must remain mindful of the fact that our resources belong to all South Africans . 
The main areas in the budget that receive more money are: 
It describes how government will raise money and how it will be spent . The national budget div@@ ides money between national departments , provinces and municipalities . Budget highlights on page 4 . 
because in previous years we handled our finances with discipline . We sav@@ ed money when our economy was doing well . As a result , we can increase spending on public services without hur@@ ting our economy . 
R6 .4 billion more for public transport , national roads and rail infrastructure 
From 2009 , government kicks off a new phase of the expanded public works programme . 
R10 .9 billion more for housing , water , sanitation and municipal services 
In its first five years ,@@ public services . 
R@@ 45 billion more for provinces to improve education , health and roads and to spend more on rural development 
More than R4 .1 billion will be invested in this programme to create even more jobs over the next five years . These jobs will be created in@@ :

Many countries are not able to respond to this situation as we can . South Africa can take these measures to protect our economy and the poor 
Government is working to create jobs were created by increasing more jobs for unemployed the number of workers used South Africans . 
Construction , maintenance and environmental protection projects 
The world economy is in a worse position than it has been in several decades . According to a report by the International Labour Organisation , more than million people could lose their jobs this year 
Government spending will continue to grow on services that help poor communities , and public works programmes which will create more new jobs . 
Over R7@@ 80 billion will be spent on large infrastructure projects over the next three years , including building more power stations , roads and rail@@ ways , upgrading water and sanitation networks 
Government aims to increase the number of full time equivalent jobs to 400 000 a year by 2014 , helping to bring down poverty and unemployment . 
South Africa is not as b@@ adly affected , and we want to keep it that way . In fact , we want to do better so that we can continue to provide for the needs of our people . 
When the economy grows at a slower rate , governments collect less taxes . This means that government will have to bor@@ row to meet some of its spending commitments . 
and providing more houses . We will also work with business and trade unions to ensure that job losses are kept to a minimum . 
R5 .4 billion more for improving the criminal justice sector 
We must also use the period ahead to try and deal with the many challenges facing us . 
Like the rest of the world , our economy is going to grow more slowly . We too are experiencing job losses and many people will struggle to cover their monthly household expenses .

The publication of the Bill for comment therefore represents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders , interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act . 
The questions are often raised why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation is the coast not simply part of the general environment 
The review concluded that a dedicated Coastal Management Act was required for implementing the White Paper . 
This chapter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Minister and the MECs . 
The coast is a unique part of the environment . It is the meeting place of the land and sea a limited spatial area that supports many human activities . 
Section 25 authorises MECs to establish coastal set@@ back lines . 
The Act also requires municipalities to develop municipal CMPs within four years of the Acts commencement , either as stand alone documents or as part of an integrated development plan prepared in accordance with the Municipal Systems Act . 
In the past , the value of coastal ecosystems as a corner@@ stone for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in decision-making in South Africa . 
The Bill intends to regulate the discharge of effluent into coastal waters from any source on land by requiring permits to authorise such discharges . 
However , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the Prot@@ ected Areas Act rather than the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act . 
The purpose of this Guide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period . 
The White Paper did not merely provide a vision , principles , goals and objectives for coastal management in South Africa . 
This chapter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all estuaries by providing that they must be managed , in accordance with@@ : a 
Chapter 5@@ : Institu@@ tional arrangements 
indicates to whom and where the Act applies and explains that the Act must be read in conjunction with the National Environmental Management Act and explains how to reconcile conflicts with other legislation . 
Se@@ a@@ front development needs to be located behind the lit@@ toral active zone - a hazardous area for development . 
For coastal development to be socially sustainable , it should emphasise public awareness and shared responsibility , empowering disadvantaged individuals and communities , including women and the poor . 
The coast is a distinctive system in which a range of considerations biophysical , economic , social and institutional inter@@ conn@@ ect , in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach . 
MANAGEMENT BILL 
This chapter provides measures for protecting the coastal environment from activities that may detrim@@ entally affect it and creates procedures for assessing and regulating such activities . 
to declare that protected areas or parts thereof are not part of the buffer zone . 
In order to protect and effectively regulate coastal public property , it is also necessary to impose controls and restrictions on certain areas adjacent to coastal public property that form part of coastal ecosystems . 
The coast needs to be managed as a system in order to make optimal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides . 
into the existing provincial and municipal land-based and economic development planning procedures in a manner that is consistent with the policy goals of the White Paper . 
Section 60 authorises the Minister or MEC to issue notices for the repair or removal of structures within the coastal zone . 
Section 38 provides for the establishment of Provincial Coastal Committees which will be responsible for coordinating coastal management in each province . Section 39 author@@ izes the MECs of each province to determine the composition of these Committees . 
Much of the wealth locked up in our coast continues to be wasted due to environmentally ins@@ ensi@@ tive development and activities . Economic and social opportunities for wealth creation and equity are being missed and coastal ecosystems are being degraded .

set coastal management objectives and include priorities and strategies for achieving these and performance indicators that can be used to measure progress . 
In order to secure public access to coastal public property , the Bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land . 
A coastal set@@ back line may , for example , be established to ensure that the shadows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise . 
In practice this means , for example , that the Minister must ensure that there is consistency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans .

Chapter 6: Coastal management 
The White Paper recommended new arrangements to coordinate coastal management in South Africa . 
Section 49 requires the alignment of certain plans with CMPs to ensure coordinated coastal management . Similarly section 50 requires consistency between CMPs and other statutory plans . 
P@@ ending the determination of an appeal , the Minister or MEC may make an interim order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act . 
The powers of the Minister and the MECs to review provincial and municipal CMPs respectively are set out in sections 5@@ 3-@@ 54 . 
A permit is also required in order to undertake certain non-@@ consum@@ p@@ tive , commercial uses of coastal public property or the exclusive economic zone in order to provide a mechanism for 
It sets out the legal mechanisms for establishing a proactive planning system for coastal areas that integr@@ ates coastal concerns 
This is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jointly by several organs of State instead of many separate authorisations .

This Chapter is designed to extend that system across the land@@ /@@ sea interface in order to allow for integrated coastal planning and the proactive control of the use of coastal resources . 
This chapter sets out the procedures to be followed when appe@@ aling against coastal protection or repair and removal notices or in connection with the granting or refusal of a permit under the Act . 
The Bill focuses on regulating human activities within , or that affect the coastal zone . 
Certain land will be regarded as coastal access land when the Bill is enacted but the designation of coastal access land may also be withdrawn or cancelled . 
The White Paper also emphas@@ izes the importance of facilitating coastal development which is sustainable . This requires development to be ecologically , socially and economically sustainable . 
national CMP . 
It also sets out the considerations which must apply in respect of such demarc@@ ations and adjustments . Inter@@ ested and affected parties have an opportunity to contribute to the process of demarc@@ ating or adjus@@ ting boundaries . 
The Bill authorises the Minister to disp@@ ense with prescribed procedure in respect of dumping in emergencies . For example , vessels in distress due to mechanical failure may need to urgently dum@@ p cargo over@@ board . 
The Bill provides procedures relating to both discharge and dumping permits . 
This Part also provides strict guidelines for decision-making which the permit issuing authority must consider . 
Section 57 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occupiers of land , coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adverse effects on the coastal environment 
The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CMPs with@@ in@@ four years of the commencement of the Act that are consistent with the national CMP and the National Est@@ u@@ arine Management Protocol . 
Prot@@ ected areas or parts thereof are automatically included in the buffer zone in terms of Section 16 . The purpose of section 22 is to enable the MEC 
Part 4 deals with the let@@ ting of coastal public property by way of coastal leases and the granting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal concessions . 
This contr@@ asts with the current situation under the Se@@ ash@@ ore Act where the se@@ ash@@ ore and sea are owned by the President on behalf of the people .@@ Coastal public property is made up primarily of the se@@ ash@@ ore and coastal waters . 
After the Cabinet approved the White Paper a comprehensive legal review was carried out . Its purpose was to determine whether the White Paper could be implemented in terms of existing laws . 
Early drafts of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas . 
Section 35 establishes a National Coastal Committee which will function at national government level . Section 36 author@@ izes the Minister to determine the composition of the Committee . 
Section 40 author@@ izes the MECs to appoint Volun@@ tary coastal officers and define their roles and responsibilities . 
The protocol will provide a national policy for estuary management and guide the development of individual estuarine management plans . 
Dem@@ arc@@ ation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal buffer zone are only likely to be instituted where the area designated by the Act is inappropriate and imp@@ edes effective coastal management . 
This provision helps facilitate a new cooperative and participatory approach to managing the coast by enhancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management . 
Includ@@ es: vision , provincial CM@@ Os . 
The coastal resource use planning system established by this Chapter will function as a mechanism for controlling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is presently used . 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental factors . 
It took a step further by providing a Plan of Action which outlines in detail how the White Paper is to be implemented . One of the elements of this Plan of Action is Institu@@ tional and Legal Development . 
However , this system orientated approach has failed to materi@@ alize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach focusing 
Coastal waters are essentially all waters influenced by ti@@ d@@ es and the sea out to the limits of the territorial sea . 
rather than as conservation areas . For example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable harvesting of sh@@ ell@@ fish for subsistence purposes in areas where such harvesting is presently depl@@ eting the sh@@ ell@@ fish resources . 
Section 59 provides for the Minister or MEC to issue written notices requiring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment . 
The Minister pointed out that due to its complexity the Bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days . 
This Bill promotes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management , which views the coast as a system and emphas@@ izes the importance of managing it as such . 
The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estimated in 1998 to be about R1@@ 68 billion annually , which was equivalent to about 35 of our annual Gross Domestic Product . 
Chapter 4: Est@@ u@@ aries 
Section 37 provides for the designation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level . 
Res@@ tric@@ ting or controlling developments in these areas is also essential to take account of the dynamic nature of the coast 
Parliament requires the publication for public comment of Bills in the Government Gazette before such Bills are introduced in Parliament for the purpose of promulg@@ ating them as legally binding Acts . 
Part 2 
Chapter 3: Bo@@ und@@ aries of coastal areas 
This chapter defines important words and terms , sets out the objectives of the proposed Act in order to guide the interpretation and application of the Act , clarif@@ ies the role of the State in relation to the coastal environment , 
The Bill also establishes a prohibition of incineration or dumping at sea of waste or other material . 
F@@ ig . 2 . Coastal Management Programmes a national coastal management programme has been adopted in accordance with section 41 . 
For coastal development to be ecologically sustainable , it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources . 
The authorisation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment . 
Part 3 prohibits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit . 
For coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diversif@@ y opportunities , provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources . 
Ph@@ ot@@ o: eThekwini Municipality 
A special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas , 
Section 68 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for granting permits for the use of coastal resources while maintaining a high level of environmental protection . 
The current land-use planning system in South Africa is a land-based system that essentially stops at the high water mark . 
The Bill requires the Minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .

Ass@@ essing the environmental impact of activities which may detrim@@ entally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were promulgated in terms of NEM@@ A on 21 April 2006 . 
Pres@@ ently the disposal of effluent through pipelines and the dumping of waste from vessels into estuaries or the sea are controlled under different pieces of legislation by different Departments . 
The White Paper highlights the importance of recognising the value of the coast . 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20 . In the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors .

When the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament South Africa will for the first time have a national Coastal Management Act in place for managing our coastal zone , a pric@@ eless national asset . 
During the first week of December 2006 the Cabinet approved the publication in the Government Gazette of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill for public comment . In a press release issued on 8 December 2006 , 
Chapter 11@@ : General Ministerial powers and duties 
The Bill does not seek to introduce new environmental impact assessment procedures . 
Chapter 1: Interpretation , objectives and application of act 
The Guide seeks to achieve this by first explaining the historical context leading to the publication in 2000 of the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa which provided a national policy for managing our coast@@ line . 
in accordance with section 28 of the National Environmental Management Act , referred to below as NEM@@ A . Section 58 stipul@@ ates the requirements which apply to the authorisation of activities causing adverse effects . 
and is it not already covered by existing environmental legisl@@ ation? Answ@@ ers to these questions are discussed below . 
The coastal zone is illustrated in F@@ ig@@ ure 1 and defined as the area comprising coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , coastal access land , 
on their specific sectors such as land-use planning , agriculture , water affairs , nature conservation and others . 
These national , provincial and municipal CMPs must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover , 
Proced@@ ures relating to public participation in respect of decision-making in accordance with the proposed Act are set out in sections 5@@ 1-@@ 52 . 
COASTAL MANAGEMENT PRO@@ GR@@ AM@@ ME@@ S 
Mar@@ th@@ in@@ us Van Schalkwyk , the Minister of Environmental Affairs & Tourism , announced that the Bill would be gaz@@ etted on 15 December 2006 . 
This is in line with the Constitutional imperatives that government ensures accountability , respon@@ siveness and openness . 
Section 55 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish zoning schemes . Section 56 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal zoning schemes . 
This chapter provides procedures for demarc@@ ating and adjus@@ ting the boundaries of coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , special management areas and coastal access land . 
Chapter 2: The coastal zone 
This chapter establishes certain offences , determines penalties in respect of offences , provides for offences under the Act to be prosecuted in the magistrates court 
the control of activities such as off@@ shore tourism . As in the case of the coastal buffer zone , the issuing of permits is subject to environmental impact assessment . 
This chapter establishes new management and planning procedures for coastal resources to ensure that development is sustainable , integrated and in the interest of all user groups . 
NATIONAL 
One of the benefits of the proposed Act is that it will replace three existing Acts completely and will repeal provisions in the Nature Conserv@@ ation Act , 198@@ 7 
metres . In other instances such as estuaries where ti@@ dal influence extends further inland than Coastal access land will secure public access to coastal public property .

For example , in developed areas where the coastal environment has been highly modified , such as Dur@@ b@@ ans beachfront and Sea Point in Cape Town , the width of the coastal buffer zone could be reduced to less than 100 
Part 2 describes the powers to be exercised by the Minister and MEC . Section 92 grants the Minister the power to exercise certain functions normally exercised by the MEC if specific circumstances apply . 
A chapter of the Bill focuses on estuaries which are much sought after for recreation 
Part 1 deals with the powers of the Minister and of MECs to make regulations to promote the Acts implementation and prescribes the consultative process that is to be followed when making regulations . 
These include provisions dealing with the continuation of existing leases on , or rights to , coastal public property , the procedures for dealing with unlawful structures on coastal public property ,

and the continuation of existing lawful activities in the coastal buffer zone that were lawful before the commencement of the Act but that after its commencement may only be conducted with a permit . 
Part 4 deals with certain General matters . Section 97 deals with Information and reporting on coastal matters . The Minister must make certain information concerning the protection and management of the coastal zone available to the public . 
The Chapter establishes a hierarchy of coastal management programmes . At the top of the hierarchy is the national CMP which the Minister must 
This chapter deals with a variety of matters in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the previous management system to the one proposed by the Bill . 
Section 95 authorises the Minister to exercise certain duties and powers normally exercised by the MEC under certain circumstances .

It also deals with other matters such as the repeal and amendment of other laws . 
The Bill provides that initially the coastal buffer zone would extend one hundred metres inland from the boundary of coastal public property 
Section 93 authorises the MEC to issue directives to municipalities . 
in areas that have already been z@@ oned for residential , commercial , industrial or multipl@@ e-@@ use purposes , and one kilom@@ etr@@ e inland in other areas . 
Part 3 deals with delegations . Section 94 deals with delegations of powers or duties by the Minister . 
However , since these dimensions are relatively arbitr@@ ary and do not take account of the very varied situations along the coast , 
The responsibilities of the Minister and MECs to prepare reports on the state of the coastal environment are also set out . Section 98 requires the coordination of actions between provinces and municipalities . 
enhance the ability of each sphere of government to perform their existing coastal management functions and facilitate the further assignment of coastal management responsibilities where appropriat@@ e? 
Accordingly , the Act has been drafted in a manner that will enable it to be implemented in conjunction with other environmental and land-use planning legislation .

To date management of linguistic diversity in post-@@ apartheid South Africa has been made problematic by the lack of a clearly defined language policy ,

The underlying principle is to retain the learners home language for learning and teaching , but to encourage learners to acquire additional languages as well .

education , legal and administrative systems , etc . ; and by generally providing scope for the publication of liter@@ ary works in that language . 
The right to use the official languages of our choice has therefore been recognised in our Bill of Rights , and our Constitution acknowledges that the languages of our people are a resource that should be harn@@ essed . 
In promoting multilingualism provinces will formulate their policies in line with the guidelines contained in this Policy Framework , taking into account their regional circumstances , and the needs and preferences of communities , as stated in the Constitution .

This step was essential in view of the lack of tolerance for linguistic diversity and the resultant multilingualism is a costly problem approach evident in some sectors of our society ,

or the transaction is between two parties who are part of the supply chain if the value of the transaction falls above a threshold prescribed by the Minister .
Currently , business name registration is op@@ tional , serving to protect businesses from other persons encro@@ aching on a trading identity .
It also prohibits informing consumers that they have won a prize when no competition has been conducted , or they have never entered a competition , or making the prize subject to a previously undisclosed condition payment of any consideration , whether for participating in the competition or for the prize itself .
The equality court is recognised as having exclusive jurisdiction to adjud@@ icate contraven@@ tions of this part in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act .
The Minister may make regulations to set deposits of containers , pallets and similar objects to be refunded to the consumer when they return it to the supplier .
Clause 26 makes it compulsory for sales records of every transaction to be provided to the consumer and prescribes the information that must be contained in a sales record .
Therefore , the Bill proposes a significant change in the current business name registration scheme by making it mand@@ atory rather than voluntary .
Such goods , when delivered , must correspond with the description or sample , or the consumer has a limited right to return them under clause 20 .
The laws that will be repealed , as set out in clause 121 and the consequ@@ ential amendments , are :
The Bill recognises that consumer protection is a matter that falls under the functional area of concurrent jurisdiction between provincial and national government in terms of Schedule 4 to the Constitution .
and intervening in any matter before any forum contemplated in this Act if the interest of consumers represented by that group are not otherwise adequately represented in that forum .
This particularly applies to circumstances where the consumer is buying on the basis of a description or sample .
Repeal and replacement of current laws
Under the existing regulatory framework , the Consumer Affairs Act , 1988 , and various other laws regulate consumer protection .
This includes commissions earned , and entities whom they represent .
This will harmon@@ ise this Bill with other laws that require differential treatment , for example , the prohibition of sales of alcohol to under-@@ age minors .
Under the Bill , a person who carries on business may only do that in the persons own full name as recorded in an official form of identification , registered name or a registered alternative business name . Trade cat@@ alogues and circul@@ ars have to reflect that name , description of the business and statement of the place where it is carried on .
In respect of lay-@@ by@@ s it provides that suppliers are accountable for amounts paid by consumers for lay-@@ by@@ s , and that the goods remain at the risk of the supplier .
Clause 36 prohibits offering prizes with the intention of not providing them .
In addition , accredited consumer protection groups have a right to be consulted in respect of any proposed industry code of practice , and any proposed regulations .
The Minister has authority to exempt certain categories of transaction from that requirement .
Right to honest and fair dealing
The right to choose includes the right to decide whether or not to continue a commercial arrangement during the course of an agreement , and once it has expired .
Un@@ consci@@ onable conduct , force , co@@ ercion , undue influence , pressure or harassment , unfair tactics or conduct is prohibited in connection with any marketing , supply , negotiation , collection or recovery of goods from consumers .
Persons who attend at a consumers place of business or residence to deliver or install any goods , or perform any services , must wear satisfactory identification .
If goods are reconditioned that has to be disclosed , and if they have been imported without the benefit of the manufacturers warranty , that fact must be disclosed .
A number of specific marketing and selling practices are prohibited , including ba@@ it marketing , negative options and referral selling .
Suppliers are prohibited from requiring consumers to purchase bundl@@ ed goods or services as described in clause 13 , unless it can be proven that the bundling results in economic benefit for consumers .
The right to equal access to the consumer market
Suppliers are oblig@@ ated under the Bill to accept the return of waste goods that may not be accepted in the common waste collection system .
The right to equal access exp@@ ands on and is concep@@ tually linked to both the Bill of Rights and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act , 2000 . It protects communities , districts , market segments or populations from being unfairly discrimin@@ ated against with regards to access to goods or services of different quality or pric@@ ing .
Clause 39 addresses the legal status of agreements between suppliers and persons who lack legal capacity to enter into such an agreement .
Right to be heard and obtain redress The Bill aims to make redress accessible , and to protect consumers from being victim@@ ised if they act to enforce their rights .
It is not to dis@@ place or over-@@ ride more specific schemes of consumer protection established in terms of any industry-@@ specific law .
Clause 69 outlines the available av@@ enues of redress , including the courts , alternative dispute resolution , and complaint to the Commission .
Consumers who are approached by direct mark@@ eters often feel psych@@ olog@@ i-@@ c@@ ally pres@@ sur@@ ed to agree to a transaction .
The Bill cod@@ ifies a number of fundamental consumer rights , as discussed below .
The Bill seeks to advance that right with the following provisions :
Un@@ reasonable transactions as described in clause 48 are prohibited , as are unjust or unfair terms or conditions .
determination of steps to be taken to ensure the performance of a particular function by a provincial consumer protection authority , in the case where no provincial consumer protection authority has been established ;
In terms of clause 61 , a producer , distributor or supplier of a good is strictly liable for any harm wholly or partly caused as a consequence of product defect or failure , with certain exceptions .
It will also permit the common practice of discounted prices for children , or for persons over a certain age , and will permit the continued use of separate facilities for different g@@ enders .
Finally , clause 67 requires suppliers to return parts and materials remaining from maintenance work .
This Bill proposes to repeal several laws replacing them with a single Consumer Protection Act , which will also give priority to its own procedures for enforcement and will modify the common law in several respects .
Because that sort of agreement is often not an exercise of free choice , clause 16 establishes the consumers right to cancel such an agreement without penalty during a brief cool@@ ing-off period of five business days .
The Bill is intended to provide a general defaul@@ t regime of consumer protection .
Right to fair , just and reasonable terms and conditions
The Minister may exempt certain transactions or services below a certain threshold .
The Bill promotes consumer activism .
Mean@@ ing of transaction and consumer
In order to enhance consumer choice the Bill introduces a number of provisions that are aimed at assisting consumers to select goods or services on the basis of having examined the goods and compared prices .
The right of consumers to privacy includes the right to accept , refuse or block any approach for the purpose of direct marketing .
To res@@ train or correct the worst abuses in the area of the marketing of goods or services , the Bill introduces or re-@@ en@@ acts a number of provisions to address the following matters :
The Minister may prescribe the information or records that intermediaries or categories of intermediaries must keep .
It further requires the supplier to compensate the consumer if the supplier is unable to produce the goods once the full price has been paid by the consumer .
To this end , the Bill provides for the Minister to consult the Members of the Provincial Executive Councils responsible for consumer affairs with respect to the co-ordination and harmonisation of the functions of the Commission and the provincial consumer protection authorities ;
The right to disclosure aims to ensure that consumers understand the terms and conditions of the transactions or agreements they enter into and are able to make informed choices about the products and services they consum@@ e .
A supplier or a person acting on his or her behalf is prohibited from making false , misleading or deceptive representations in respect of any goods and services under the circumstances listed in clause 41 .
In addition , if the consumer had informed the supplier of the use he wants to put the goods to , the consumer has the right to expect that it will be suitable for that particular purpose .
An ombud , consumer court or provincial authority that has resolved a complaint may record the agreement as an order , which must then be confirmed as a consent order by the courts .
The right to choose encompasses the consumers right to examine goods .
The Bill im@@ poses an obligation on the supplier to issue aler@@ ts of any activity or facility that is subject to any hazard that could result in serious injury or death to consumers ;
Trade des@@ criptions applied to any goods must not be misleading , and must not be tampered with . The Minister may prescribe categories of goods to which a trade description must be applied .
The Bill replac@@ es the current Lot@@ tery Act scheme for regulating promotional competitions .
To this end consumers have the following rights :
Suppliers accountability to consumers
The Bill sets out standards for fair and responsible marketing and provides a general prohibition against marketing that is misleading , fraudulent or deceptive , as described in clause 35 .
To further protect consumers , the Minister may prescribe certain days , dates and times during which it is prohibited to contact consumers for promotional purposes .
There is a prohibition against over@@ selling and over@@ booking , which requires a supplier not to accept consideration for any goods or services unless they reasonably expect to have capacity to supply them or intend to provide goods or services that are materially different . Consumers have to be refunded in full with interest and consumers can also claim contr@@ actual and consequ@@ ential damages , including economic losses .
The liability provided for in the Bill is in addition to any other liability of that person in terms of any law , and extends to loss arising from death , illness or injury , or loss or damage to any property .
Clause 58 provides guidance to the courts with regards to how they should assess unconscionable conduct , unfair , unjust or unreasonable contract terms , or deal with prohibited contract terms .
If an advertisement or notice states that prices are subject to a reduction or sale price , clause 23 provides for a consistent application of such notices , so that consumers can better comp@@ are prices in a consistent fashion .
If the sponsor of a loyalty programme ke@@ eps a register of members , the sponsor may increase the price of rewards only after notifying the members .
or a franchisee in terms of a franchise agreement .
The definition of consumer is extended to the actual users of goods or services , regardless of who actually may have conducted a transaction or paid for the goods or services .
The Bill makes it compulsory to display prices for any goods that are displayed for sale .
The right to choose also includes the right of the consumer to cancel advance reservations or book@@ ings , but suppliers may charge advance deposits and impose reasonable cancellation penalties .
The dti believes that consumers have a right , and need , to be able to ascertain the identity of the legal person with whom they are dealing .
or the Minister has concluded that the existing provincial consumer protection authority is unable to perform that function effectively .
Up@@ front disclosure for preparing an estimate is also required .
Therefore , clause 5 provides for the Minister to grant industry-wide exemp@@ tions from the application of specific provisions of this Bill on the request of a relevant industry regulator , if the National Consumer Commission advises that the specific industry scheme offers at least as much protection for consumers as they would have under this Bill .
The Bill recognises the role of civil society in consumer protection by providing for the support of any juristic person or association of persons that meet the set criteria as consumer protection groups .
Consumer Affairs Act , 1988 Trade Prac@@ tices Act , 1976 S@@ ale and Service Matters Act , 1964 Business Names Act , 1960 Businesses Act , 1991 Price Control Act , 1964 Sections 2 to 13 and sections 16 to 17 of the Mer@@ ch@@ andise Marks Act , 1941 Section 54 of the Lot@@ teries Act , 1997 , and related regulations .
Clause 26 sets out disclosure requirements that intermediaries who are not regulated under another law have to comply with .
Clause 17 describes circum@@ -@@ stances under which a cancellation penalty may be considered unreasonable .
notice or instructions of safe handling of goods ;
In addition , it will allow suppliers to target their marketing to specific population groups to the extent that is reasonable , having regard to the goods and services being offered .
However , the supplier can exceed the original estimate if the consumer in writing dec@@ lines the estimate or pre-@@ authorises any charges up to a specified maximum .
Thus , depending on the context , a consumer means a person to whom goods or services are marketed in the ordinary course of business ; a person who has entered into an agreement or transaction with a supplier ;
The Bill applies to goods or services whether promoted by a for profit business , or by a non-profit entity , the State or entities contracted by the State , including Public Private Part@@ nerships .
Suppliers of repair , maintenance or replacement services cannot charge consumers for these services unless the consumer was provided with an estimate which the consumer has authorised .
The Bill regul@@ ates loyalty programmes by requiring sponsors of loyalty programmes to meet their obligations when loyalty credits are tendered , prohibits offering inferior quality products or requiring the bundling of reward goods or services with revenue products , requires a supplier to accept the tender of sufficient loyalty credits as adequate consideration for goods and services at any time , subject to limited black@@ -out periods .
In addition , clause 2 specifically provides that in case of a conflict between this Bill and any other law protecting consumers within an industry , the laws are to be enforced con@@ currently , as far as possible , and beyond that , the law that provides the greater degree of protection for consumers is to prevail .
Clause 82 establishes a scheme for the development through consultation of industry codes of conduct relating to consumer matters , and provides for them to receive the force of law by being prescribed by the Minister .
If a third party has a legal claim over the goods , the supplier is liable to that third party , unless it can be shown that the supplier and consumer coll@@ uded to defraud the third party .
Certain agreements or provisions of agreements are listed as unlawful in clause 51 , and are void from inc@@ eption irrespective of the common law or provision of other laws .
The Bill aims to cod@@ ify and improve on the common law by addressing unfair contract terms and provide consumers with remedies where there have been breaches of contract .
Clause 63 provides that prepaid certificates , credits and vouchers remain negoti@@ able for up to five years , and that the supplier is oblig@@ ated to honour them when presented .
Clause 22 outlines the circumstances under which a document would be considered to be in plain language , and the Commission may publish guidelines for methods assessing whether a document satisfies that requirement .
The Bill retains the existing prohib@@ itions against fraudulent schemes and offers , p@@ yramid and related schemes .
The dti believes that large transactions involving large businesses and the State do not require the protection offered by the Bill because they would benefit from the flexibility of operating in an unregulated market . Therefore , the Bill will not apply to transactions when the consumer is the State , or any organ of state ;
New provisions in clause 45 aim to ensure fairness in auc@@ tions by regulating the participation of owners or their agents as bidders , and requiring notice of any reserve bid or upset price .
Clause 33 establishes standards for the conduct of catalogue sales , clause 34 regul@@ ates the use of trade coup@@ ons , and clause 37 regul@@ ates the marketing of work from home schemes .
The provisions regarding the criteria for , and registration of , business names have been revised , modernised and harmon@@ ised with proposals under discussion for criteria applicable to companies in terms of the Companies Act .
To enable consumers to exercise this right the Act provides for consumers to make a formal demand to a mark@@ eter to discontinue any such approach to that consumer , and it contempl@@ ates the establishment of an Exclus@@ ion Register either by industry or by the Commission .
The Bill will apply to most transactions in the ordinary course of business between parties within the Republic , to the promotion of goods and services that could lead to such transactions , and to the goods and services themselves after the transaction is completed .
The Bill further sets out the matters over which provincial consumer protection authorities have jurisdiction in respect of activities occurring or application by per@@ -@@ sons carrying on business exclusively within their provinces , including issuing , on behalf of the Commission , of compliance notices ;
Provisions that seek to limit the suppliers liability must be specifically and conspic@@ uously brought to the attention of the consumer , as outlined in clause 49 .
or the interaction concerns the supply or potential supply of goods or services to or at the direction of the consumer .
This includes franchise transactions or agreements as described in clause 5 .
Clause 14 establishes the consumers right to cancel a fixed-term agreement , limits the rights of suppliers to impose cancellation charges , and sets out rules governing the expir@@ ing of such agreements .
It provides that consumers have a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are intended , of good quality , in good working order , free of defects , and us@@ eable and durable for a reasonable period of time .
Currently contracts are regulated in terms of the common law .
Any repairs or maintenance cost above the original estimate has to be authorised by the consumer .
Consumers have to be informed and provided with the identity of the agents or person and informed of their right to rescind the agreement during the cool@@ ing-off period .
In terms of clause 44 , the consumer has the right to assume , and it is an implied term of every transaction , that the supplier or less@@ or has legal right to sell or lease the goods for full title of the goods to pass to the consumer .
Such a register would allow consumers to pre-emp@@ tively block direct marketing approaches .
Clause 9 sets out a small number of well-@@ defined , long-standing and widely accepted commercial practices that allow differential treatment of consumers of a particular sex , age or gender , and states that those practices are not to be construed as unfair discrimination , if the conduct is reasonable .
Ac@@ credited consumer protection groups may also enforce consumer rights by commencing or undertaking any lawful act to protect the interests of a consumer individually or a group of consumers collectively in any matter or before any forum contemplated in the Bill ;
If two prices are displayed for the same goods , the lowest has to be charged .
a user of the goods or a recipient or beneficiary of the services ;
Clause 32 outlines standards to be adhered to when suppliers engage in direct marketing .
In addition to their jurisdiction to hear a matter initiated directly by a consumer , the courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals against Tribunal decisions , and may order suppliers to alter or discontinue certain practices , award damages against suppliers for collective injury to all or a class of consumers , to be paid to any person on any terms that the court might decide .
In addition , there is a general prohibition against consumers being subjected to unfair discrimination when they are entering into a transaction or agreement , and in all aspects of the conduct of the supplier towards the consumer in the course of the transaction .
The Bill identifies the following elements that make a transaction a consumer transaction , and thus bringing it within the scope of the Bill if it is an interaction or agreement to interact between a consumer and supplier in the ordinary course of the suppliers business , including in terms of any public regulation ;
If a complaint is made to the Commission , it will investigate , and may make a referral to the Tribunal , which may resolve the matter by making certain orders as contemplated in clause 75 .
notice on how to inhibit any risk associated with the use of goods , and to remedy or mitigate the effects , and provide for the safe disposal of the goods .
Under certain circumstances , as described in clause 21 , goods or services delivered to or performed for consumers may be regarded as unsolicited , in which case the con@@ -@@ sum@@ er has no obligation to pay for them , and the return of the goods to the supplier is at the suppliers own risk and expense .
The Bill would hold suppliers accountable to consumers for any money or other property belonging to the consumer , but held by the supplier under any agreement , including advance payments for services to be supplied at a later date .
However , this does not apply to used goods or immovable property .
If a complaint ar@@ ises in an industry in which a statutory ombud scheme is in place , the consumer must pursue a resolution through that scheme before making a complaint to the Commission .
C@@ ause 60 creates a framework for industry codes to be developed , establishing schemes of product safety monitoring and , if needed , product recall .
This Part aims to safeguard the safety of consumers and to establish a regime of product liability , irrespective of negligence on the part of anyone in the supply chain , which currently does not exist in South Africa .
The Commission would have authority to order an investigation and recall of any dangerous or defective products covered by any such industry code .
If a complaint under this Part is directed to the Commission , it will be referred to the equality court .
there is an exchange of consideration ;
Right to privacy
The Bill provides for a general right for consumers to receive goods that are of good quality and free from defects , as described in clause 55 .
However , an excep@@ tion is allowed where the consumer has been expressly informed of the condition of the goods and has expressly agreed to buy them in that particular state .
