S@@ tim@@ ul@@ ating economic growth through coordin@@ ated infrastructure investment and strategic programmes 
A R@@ equ@@ est for Qu@@ alif@@ ication was issued last week to the Mar@@ ket for a D@@ esig@@ n , Con@@ struc@@ t , F@@ ix@@ ed Pr@@ ice T@@ ur@@ n@@ key contract . The purpose of this proc@@ ur@@ ement is to enable the D@@ T@@ P 
In respect of SM@@ ME support , during the trade mission to Indi@@ a in Dec@@ ember 2005 led by the Premier , contact was established with the National Sm@@ all Indus@@ tries Corporation L@@ t@@ d in Indi@@ a , 
The improv@@ ement in employment fig@@ ures over the last year , mor@@ e@@ over , is cer@@ tain@@ ly parti@@ ally attr@@ ibut@@ able to the cooper@@ atives initi@@ ative , which is already estim@@ ated to have attr@@ acted close to 35 000 individuals , 
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing success in the promotion of cooper@@ atives and SM@@ ME@@ s means that our resources must be direc@@ ted to support both cooper@@ atives and SM@@ ME@@ s at district level . 
int@@ er alia , a coordin@@ ated and effici@@ ently implemented infrastruc@@ tural investment programme , in which both government and the private sector will have major rol@@ es to play . 
In this regard I am also pleased to report very satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ y progress over the last year@@ : 
In the for@@ th@@ coming MTEF , r@@ ing@@ -@@ f@@ enced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job cre@@ ation , poverty rel@@ ief and black economic empow@@ erment . These programmes are the follow@@ ing: 
 this strategy in tur@@ n is al@@ ig@@ ned to the national Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and Sh@@ ar@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative . The r@@ ation@@ ale behind this approach is s@@ impl@@ e: 
Em@@ pow@@ erment initiatives 
A further 5 high prof@@ ile cases of fr@@ a@@ ud and cor@@ ruption involv@@ ing sy@@ nd@@ icates are under investigation , and we have jo@@ ined forces with the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations and As@@ set For@@ fe@@ iture Unit in order to sec@@ ure successful pro@@ secu@@ tions . 
Mr Speaker , in last years address I all@@ ud@@ ed to the fact that we will not att@@ ain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty all@@ ev@@ iation programmes 
 the Office of the Premier will be responsible for coordin@@ ating the s@@ occ@@ er development programme across the departments involved . 
into the second ph@@ ase of development by establish@@ ing sec@@ ondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary cooper@@ atives . El@@ even sec@@ ondary co@@ ops will be s@@ et@@ up in each of the district municipalities and me@@ tro , 
pre-@@ qualif@@ ied b@@ id@@ ders that are techn@@ ically , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally and leg@@ ally qualif@@ ied and meet the empow@@ erment cr@@ iter@@ ia , 
S@@ uch practices have to become far more efficient , ensuring that administrative del@@ ays do not place un@@ be@@ ar@@ able c@@ ash@@ flow bur@@ den on the SM@@ ME@@ s . 
In terms of employment , according to the St@@ ats SA Labour For@@ ce S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey , in 2004 9@@ 9@@ 3 ,@@ 000 people in the province were un@@ employed - this dec@@ lin@@ ed to 9@@ 8@@ 7 ,@@ 000 in 2005 , 
The re@@ forms in our as@@ set and supply ch@@ ain management systems and policies are proceed@@ ing on tr@@ ack and are set to gre@@ at@@ ly improve effici@@ encies in the way we proc@@ ure and account for goods and services and physical assets . 
The land at L@@ a M@@ erc@@ y to be s@@ old to the province . 
World Cup stadi@@ um development 
The int@@ ention is to provide a br@@ id@@ ging programme , a one year certificate , a two year di@@ pl@@ oma and a three year d@@ eg@@ ree in cooper@@ atives and business management practice . 
Some of the cases are before the courts of law and mis@@ conduct enquir@@ ies are also being handl@@ ed by respective departments . 
Bo@@ th Ith@@ ala and the Provincial Government conc@@ ede that this demand for finance cannot be met by Ith@@ ala al@@ one . 
for emer@@ ging contrac@@ tors aimed at promoting and supporting af@@ firm@@ able business and equ@@ ity in the civil and building contrac@@ tor sector . It com@@ pr@@ ises a si@@ x@@ -@@ st@@ aged adv@@ anc@@ ement programme with contract value lim@@ its determined by experience , training and capacity . 
G@@ iven the h@@ ug@@ e deal flow which the initi@@ al SM@@ ME fund managed by Ith@@ ala has already gener@@ ated , the He@@ ad of Treasury was t@@ asked to develop a scheme 
which will then enter into contr@@ actual agreements with AC@@ SA to manage and oper@@ ate the air@@ port and with the sel@@ ected b@@ id@@ der from the private sector to design and construc@@ t the facility . 
amoun@@ ting to appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately R@@ 6@@ b@@ n in 2005@@ /0@@ 6 , to s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate growth in the SM@@ ME sector and to advance black economic empow@@ erment generally . 
P@@ OL@@ IC@@ Y P@@ R@@ I@@ OR@@ I@@ TI@@ E@@ S F@@ O@@ R THE 2006/07 MTEF 
The focus will be on dis@@ sem@@ ination of information and giving guid@@ ance to women , youth and the dis@@ abled . 
The rel@@ oc@@ ation of Durban International A@@ ir@@ port when K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International is oper@@ ational in 2009 ; and 
D@@ r@@ aft legislation establish@@ ing the D@@ T@@ P has been prepared and will be submitted to this Legisl@@ ature in March . I appeal to Honourable Members to ensure that this Bill is deal@@ t with within the str@@ ict tim@@ e@@ fr@@ ames we have set ourselves . 
As I mentioned , this year we will also be ins@@ tit@@ ut@@ ing a new co-@@ fin@@ ancing mod@@ el to support the growth of the small business sector in the province . 
An important part of governments infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic investment programme for the medi@@ um term is the R@@ ich@@ ards Bay Indus@@ trial Development Z@@ one . 
if economic growth can be st@@ ep@@ ped up to aver@@ age 4 ,@@ 5 over the next five years , and 6 from 2009 to 20@@ 14 , th@@ en@@ : 
to empow@@ er them so as to be cap@@ able of run@@ ning vi@@ able commercial enterprises . This means that sec@@ ondary co@@ ops will need to pos@@ s@@ ess skills in financial management , 
We are propos@@ ing to alloc@@ ate R@@ 3@@ 1@@ m , R@@ 8@@ 9@@ m and R1@@ 3@@ 9 ,@@ 5@@ m over the MTEF period as a contribution to the building of s@@ occ@@ er stadi@@ um infrastructure in the province . 
A special training unit has been created in collabor@@ ation with the Un@@ iversity of Z@@ ul@@ ul@@ and to tr@@ ain man@@ agers and members of co@@ ops and to develop c@@ are@@ ers in the field . 
with the main functions of providing support to primary cooper@@ atives , which are by design production units . The int@@ ention is to ensure that primary cooper@@ atives get support from sec@@ ondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary cooper@@ atives , 
This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Tr@@ aditional Affairs , 
which will together with the Department of S@@ port and Rec@@ re@@ ation play a coordin@@ ating role in ass@@ isting the District Municip@@ alities of Am@@ aj@@ uba , U@@ g@@ u , uM@@ g@@ ung@@ un@@ dl@@ ov@@ u and u@@ Th@@ ung@@ ulu 
In the area of governance and risk management , quar@@ ter@@ ly summ@@ ary reports on the risk prof@@ ile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet . 
A contract is being conclud@@ ed with the N@@ SI@@ C team of consult@@ ants , who will be based in the province for 10 weeks , and who will work with a team from Treasury and Economic Development . 
marketing and general business management . For technical skills sec@@ ondary co@@ ops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required ex@@ pert@@ ise and for private sector w@@ ishing to do business with this sector . 
The Dube Tr@@ ade@@ Port Section 21 Comp@@ any will have to be con@@ ver@@ ted into a stat@@ ut@@ ory public entity under the P@@ F@@ M@@ A that is empow@@ ered to establish K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International A@@ ir@@ port Special P@@ ur@@ pose V@@ ehic@@ le , 
Ag@@ ainst this back@@ ground , what are the governments expenditure prior@@ ities for the new MTEF budget cy@@ c@@ le commenc@@ ing in six week@@ s@@ ? 
including the provision and lo@@ an of capital equipment , on a day to day basis and are not dep@@ end@@ ant on government support perman@@ ently . Sup@@ port will be given to sec@@ ondary co@@ ops 
E@@ CON@@ OM@@ I@@ C S@@ NA@@ P@@ S@@ H@@ O@@ T 
int@@ er alia through the b@@ arg@@ aining mus@@ c@@ le it will ac@@ quir@@ e over the control of resources and mark@@ ets through the sh@@ e@@ er sc@@ ale of its operations , with benefits f@@ low@@ ing to members of the cooper@@ atives . 
The fl@@ ag@@ ship Dube Tr@@ ade@@ Port project incor@@ por@@ ating a state of the art A@@ ir@@ port in K@@ ing Sh@@ aka International has made sol@@ id progress and we are on tr@@ ack to achieve our de@@ adl@@ ine for the project to be oper@@ ational by 2009 . 
Our qu@@ est to n@@ ar@@ row the g@@ ap between the first and second econom@@ ies will continue to be a centr@@ al fe@@ ature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as b@@ ar@@ bed w@@ ire , cer@@ am@@ ic til@@ es , agr@@ i-@@ food products , building materials , p@@ aper products etc ; 
will deal with each of these three policy pri@@ ority areas in tur@@ n . 
allow@@ ing time in the first year of the MTEF for the stak@@ eholders to fin@@ alise the business case , funding mod@@ el and ow@@ nership arrangements . 
I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term consist@@ ency in the budget policy framework and direction to achieve maximum impact over time . 
The equipment and professional ex@@ pert@@ ise provided by the N@@ SI@@ C will be used to support the growth and development of small medi@@ um and mic@@ r@@ o enterprises in the province , including cooper@@ atives at both the primary and sec@@ ondary level . 
C@@ o-@@ fin@@ ancing strategy 
The int@@ ention 
and an electronic system to perform the acqu@@ isi@@ tion stage of S@@ C@@ M , nam@@ ely the sour@@ c@@ ing of Qu@@ ot@@ ations and T@@ end@@ ers this project will both improve effici@@ encies and tur@@ n@@ around times as well as help to el@@ imin@@ ate fr@@ a@@ ud and cor@@ ruption . 
Our pro@@ posal is to set as@@ ide R@@ 20 million , R2@@ 00 million and R1 ,@@ 5 billion over the 2006/07 MTEF years for this project this is over and above the R1@@ 00@@ m already in this years budget for the Trade Port . 
I have all@@ ud@@ ed to the succ@@ esses already att@@ ained in establish@@ ing primary cooper@@ atives around the province in the last year . This year we int@@ end to mo@@ ve the cooper@@ atives programme 
But hope sm@@ il@@ es from the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come Wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing it will be happ@@ ier ; 
for fin@@ ancing business applications from primary cooper@@ atives will be aug@@ ment@@ ed by alloc@@ ations of R1@@ 00@@ m , R1@@ 8@@ 7@@ m and R2@@ 17@@ m over the 2006/07 MTEF these funds will be managed by the Department of Economic Development . 
In re@@ view@@ ing its policy prior@@ ities for the new MTEF period , the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the go@@ al of plac@@ ing the province on a sustain@@ ably higher growth p@@ ath a centr@@ al part of its economic development strategy 
In the March budget address a year ago it was emphas@@ ized that government intended to use its proc@@ ur@@ ement sp@@ end on goods and services , 
As the D@@ T@@ P will no longer be established as a P@@ P@@ P , the R1@@ 00@@ m allocated to the project in this years budget will be ro@@ u@@ ted v@@ ia Ith@@ ala to facilitate site prepar@@ ation work including site acqu@@ isi@@ tion , per@@ im@@ eter f@@ enc@@ ing , 
This does not me@@ an that we will be neg@@ l@@ ecting the need for continued support for primary cooper@@ atives . The initi@@ al alloc@@ ation of R1@@ 10@@ m to Ith@@ ala in the current financial year 
This investment will s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate economic development along these no@@ d@@ es and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
AC@@ SA to ac@@ quir@@ e a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a conc@@ es@@ sion within or after the 10 year term ; 
This is a significant development , as h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th governance and risk management issues c@@ ut@@ ting across all departments will be highl@@ igh@@ ted at an executive level . 
This pres@@ sure on Ith@@ ala is a refl@@ ection that in SM@@ ME finance for the dis@@ advant@@ aged , Ith@@ ala is the institution of cho@@ ice . 
In terms of over@@ all economic growth , according to St@@ ats SA KwaZulu-Natal record@@ ed a growth rate of 4 ,@@ 9 in 2004 , second only to the Western Cape at 5 ,@@ 3 and above the national growth rate of 4 ,@@ 5 
Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ment of sec@@ ondary cooper@@ atives 
which we hope to conclud@@ e by Dec@@ ember 2006 . A@@ ward of the contract will fol@@ low and it is expected that main construction will comm@@ ence in March 2007 , with facilities to be completed and oper@@ ational by Oc@@ t@@ ob@@ er 2009 . 
But some of you might leg@@ iti@@ mat@@ ely ask whether all these government interventions have had a meas@@ ur@@ able effect on improving the economic performance of the province . 
The Dube Tr@@ ade@@ Port as a stat@@ ut@@ ory public entity will be mand@@ ated to dr@@ ive the trade zone development , the cy@@ ber@@ port , the agricultural zone and other associated commercial developments . 
Be@@ fore the end of June the Department of Economic Development will conv@@ ene a confer@@ ence involv@@ ing representatives of all municipalities to discus@@ s common and coordin@@ ated approach to Local Economic Development . 
We must re@@ alise that we are do@@ om@@ ing the cooper@@ atives and SM@@ ME@@ s we are establish@@ ing to failure from the out@@ set unless we fol@@ low through by facilit@@ ating access to government proc@@ ur@@ ement on a sustainable basis . 
The Un@@ iversity of KwaZulu-Natal will also be appro@@ ached on a similar basis . 
J@@ ust to what extent these im@@ pres@@ sive growth and employment fig@@ ures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficul@@ t to qu@@ an@@ tif@@ y at this stage . 
 we are of the un@@ sh@@ ak@@ e@@ able view that 
To this end , we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year . 
Many people in the izimb@@ izo reported del@@ ays in g@@ etting approval this is s@@ impl@@ y due to the large v@@ olum@@ es of applications . 
Al@@ though we have ind@@ eed made progress in addres@@ sing the centr@@ al challenges of poverty , un@@ employment and service back@@ log@@ s in the past year , much remains to be done in the short , medi@@ um and long term . 
Cr@@ imin@@ al investig@@ ations , which will ev@@ ent@@ ually lead to pro@@ secu@@ tion , are being conducted by the Special Inv@@ estig@@ ation Unit , a div@@ ision of the National Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ing Authority . 
It will apply to both civil eng@@ ine@@ ering works such as air@@ ports , run@@ ways , br@@ id@@ ges , roads etc , as well as general building works . 
which has more than f@@ if@@ ty years experience in promoting the growth of small sc@@ ale indus@@ tries and business enterprises . We are expl@@ oring two areas of cooper@@ ation with the N@@ S@@ IC@@ : 
The SE@@ D@@ As will work in collabor@@ ation with Ith@@ ala and the Department of Economic Development to provide support services at district level 
and finance , re@@ al estate and business services , which gre@@ w at 7 ,@@ 9 . The manufac@@ turing sector gre@@ w at a heal@@ thy rate of 4 ,@@ 5 . 
 and failure to meet the de@@ adl@@ ine is not an option then all rol@@ e-@@ players will have to play their part , including this Legisl@@ ature . 
but that B@@ E@@ E@@ -@@ owned companies and emer@@ ging contrac@@ tors enj@@ oy maximum benefit from the contr@@ acts put out to tender . Treasury has accord@@ ingly developed a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed infrastructure proc@@ ur@@ ement policy 
We remain determined therefore to ful@@ f@@ il our obligations to the taxpay@@ ing citizens of this country by maint@@ aining and ind@@ eed improving our high standards in the field of financial management and good governance . 
Treasury took an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented mo@@ ve to engage law@@ y@@ ers to op@@ pose court applications against the Department of Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are , and that s@@ av@@ ed m@@ illi@@ ons of r@@ ands while it unc@@ overed a sc@@ am which was dr@@ aining funds dest@@ ined for the poor . 
Mr Speaker , Honourable Members , I must str@@ ess that if the de@@ adl@@ ine for the project to be oper@@ ational by 2009 is to be met 
and other ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ities , amoun@@ ting to the loss of t@@ ens of m@@ illi@@ ons of r@@ ands in various departments , public enti@@ ties and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year . 
in such a way that governments B@@ E@@ E policy and objectives are met . I expec@@ t in the coming year to be able to report actual expenditure fig@@ ures per department on proc@@ ur@@ ement from B@@ E@@ E companies , SM@@ ME@@ s and cooper@@ atives . 
unless at the same time we focus as a government on improving effici@@ encies and achiev@@ ing better value for the v@@ ast sum@@ s of money we sp@@ end on these programmes . 
May I rem@@ ind you again of the words of Al@@ fr@@ ed l@@ ord T@@ en@@ ny@@ son who sa@@ id@@ : 
We pro@@ pose to set as@@ ide R@@ 90 million and R1@@ 00 million in 2007@@ /0@@ 8 and 200@@ 8@@ /0@@ 9 respec@@ tively for development of the ID@@ Z , 
In the MTEF period , therefore , funding alloc@@ ations of R@@ 50 , R@@ 5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 6@@ 0@@ m have been set as@@ ide for the development of s@@ occ@@ er at all levels in the province in collabor@@ ation with SA@@ F@@ A 
with a tol@@ l free number to assist with qu@@ er@@ ies . This will be set up by April this year . 
Pro@@ g@@ ress was also made in enforc@@ ing our policy of z@@ er@@ o tol@@ er@@ ance for fr@@ a@@ ud and cor@@ ruption . Si@@ x high prof@@ ile investig@@ ations into fr@@ a@@ ud , cor@@ ruption , theft , mis@@ management , mal@@ administration 
I can say with some conf@@ idence that the programmes and economic sectors being prior@@ it@@ ised by government , with one or two exc@@ ep@@ tions , appear to be yi@@ el@@ ding positive results in terms of performance and tr@@ ends over the last two years . 
In respect of Per@@ form@@ ance B@@ ud@@ g@@ eting System , the rol@@ l@@ out of the system in departments is proceed@@ ing on sch@@ edule , and demonstr@@ ation data bas@@ es have been install@@ ed in Provincial Treasury , Health and Trans@@ port . 
that will bring ban@@ ks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of SM@@ ME@@ s in the Province , ther@@ eby rel@@ iev@@ ing the pres@@ sure on Ith@@ ala . 
The bal@@ ance of funds required will have to come from deb@@ t fin@@ ancing . The Development Bank has already agreed in princi@@ ple to provide deb@@ t funding sec@@ ured against revenue stre@@ ams of the project up to R@@ 5@@ 00@@ m . 
income per cap@@ it@@ a will r@@ ise by 50 in the next ten years , and the rate of un@@ employment will be hal@@ v@@ ed . 
In this regard , government has identified several key projects and programmes as prior@@ ities for the for@@ th@@ coming MTEF . These can be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follow@@ s: 
It is un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic however , to expec@@ t that the provincial economy will laun@@ ch itself onto a higher growth p@@ ath on its own acc@@ ord . A struc@@ tural growth accel@@ eration of this mag@@ nit@@ ude will require , 
We have sec@@ ured a leg@@ ally b@@ inding Mo@@ U with AC@@ SA and the National Minister of Trans@@ port providing for@@ : 
S@@ ite prepar@@ ation and install@@ ation of back@@ b@@ one infrastructure is expected to comm@@ ence by the end of the cal@@ end@@ ar year . 
The challenge fac@@ ing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within plan@@ ned tim@@ e@@ fr@@ ames , 
and the commis@@ sion@@ ing of a stud@@ y by a team of N@@ SI@@ C ex@@ per@@ ts to review the current mechanisms , legislation and policies in the province designed to support SM@@ ME@@ s in the province . 
It is often heard that leng@@ thy del@@ ays occ@@ ur in pay@@ ing the SM@@ ME@@ s 
When President Mb@@ eki sa@@ id@@ : C@@ lear@@ ly the m@@ asses of our people are conv@@ inc@@ ed that our country has entered into its age of H@@ op@@ e , I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say SI@@ Y@@ A@@ V@@ UM@@ A . 
based on an aver@@ age of 9 people per cooper@@ ative many of these have already found employment through their cooper@@ atives or are lik@@ ely to do so in the near future . 
to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camp@@ s . We are also of the view however that we need not just to build s@@ occ@@ er stadi@@ um infrastructure , but also the s@@ port itself in the province . 
Dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions are also in progress on the fin@@ ancing mod@@ el for the Trade Port . The total investment required for the air@@ port , which is part of the Trade Port , is about R@@ 2 .@@ 5 billion over the next four to five years . 
7@@ 0 at Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are ; 23 at Home Affairs ; 3 ,@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 in other departments ; and 15 medical doc@@ tors and ag@@ ents were impl@@ icated . 
back@@ b@@ one infrastructure out@@ l@@ ay and the development of the N@@ 2 inter@@ change . The tend@@ ers for this initi@@ al site prepar@@ ation and technical work have already closed and are currently being ad@@ jud@@ icated . 
once again well above the national aver@@ age , and close to the A@@ S@@ G@@ I-@@ SA targ@@ et of 6 . 
The provincial budget will accord@@ ingly continue to play a key role as policy instrum@@ ent to address the soci@@ o@@ economic challenges con@@ fron@@ ting us . 
This is con@@ cre@@ te proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empow@@ erment . 
Fund@@ ing in the amount of R@@ 5@@ 0@@ m , R@@ 5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 60 ,@@ 5@@ m has been allocated to the Department of Economic Development for the establishment of sec@@ ondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary cooper@@ atives in the MTEF period . 
We have undertaken to cooper@@ ate with and assist the South African Wom@@ en En@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s in collabor@@ ation with the Department of Trade and Industry . 
This ID@@ Z was pro@@ cl@@ aimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 2002 . Sin@@ ce then , however , there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure out@@ l@@ ays required to make the ID@@ Z work . 
to sel@@ ect at least 2 , but no more than 3 
s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ating economic growth through coordin@@ ated infrastructure investment , cre@@ ating jobs and all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targ@@ eted interventions in the second economy , and exp@@ an@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery . 
and that have sufficient experience and resources 
IN@@ TE@@ R@@ V@@ EN@@ TION TH@@ RE@@ E@@ : V@@ al@@ ue for money and good governance initiatives 
It is sur@@ ely no co@@ inc@@ idence , however , that growth in the construction sector is sur@@ ging , given the provincial governments increased expenditure on infrastructure tot@@ all@@ ing R@@ 7 ,@@ 4@@ 2 b@@ n over the last two years . 
In this regard , I have t@@ asked the Treasury with establish@@ ing a small unit to focus on f@@ ast@@ -@@ tr@@ acking of payments to cooper@@ atives and SM@@ ME@@ s , 
Sec@@ tors in the province which experi@@ enced particularly strong growth in 2004 were construction , which gre@@ w at a st@@ agg@@ ering 28 ,@@ 8 , 
As at the end of Dec@@ ember 2005 , Ith@@ ala had approved 40@@ 5 SM@@ ME business plans wor@@ th R@@ 4@@ 3@@ 3 million . O@@ f this amount over R1@@ 7@@ 9 million has already been dis@@ bur@@ sed . 
In April 2006 a det@@ ailed R@@ equ@@ est for Pro@@ pos@@ als will be issued to sel@@ ected b@@ id@@ ders to pre@@ p@@ are more det@@ ailed b@@ ids . B@@ y S@@ ep@@ t@@ ember 2006 a b@@ id@@ der will be sel@@ ected and det@@ ailed negotiations will comm@@ ence , 
During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R@@ 200@@ m to Ith@@ ala to dr@@ ive the SM@@ ME programme for the province p@@ ending the fin@@ alisation of a struc@@ tured SM@@ ME Fund . 
A provincial supply ch@@ ain management framework policy has been compil@@ ed to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to proc@@ ure goods and services , including from cooper@@ atives , 
In the coming year therefore , we are going to be implementing a new programme to support SM@@ ME@@ s the details of which I will rev@@ e@@ al shor@@ tly . 
It should come as no sur@@ pr@@ ise therefore , that the budget expenditure propos@@ als for 2006/07 recomm@@ ended by Cabinet can be categ@@ or@@ ized into three bro@@ ad areas which are consistent with the them@@ es which under@@ p@@ in@@ ned last years budget , nam@@ el@@ y@@ : 
for services rend@@ ered and/or suppl@@ ies provided . 
The consequ@@ ence of this is the need to exp@@ and the Department of Economic Development , with more staff employed to provide support cent@@ res in all distric@@ ts in collabor@@ ation with municipal initiatives and to streng@@ then Local Economic Development . 
and the anti@@ cip@@ ated s@@ av@@ ings are as follow@@ s: R@@ 9 ,@@ 4@@ m s@@ av@@ ings per month ; R1@@ 1@@ 3@@ m s@@ av@@ ings per ann@@ um and R@@ 3@@ 3@@ 8@@ m s@@ av@@ ings over a 3 year period . Fur@@ ther@@ more a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspec@@ t@@ s: 
- this compar@@ es to a growth rate for K@@ Z@@ N in 200@@ 3 of just 2 ,@@ 8 . In 2005 K@@ Z@@ N@@ s economic growth rate is pro@@ jec@@ ted to be in the region of 5 ,@@ 2 , 
We have wel@@ com@@ ed the laun@@ ch of Sm@@ all En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise Development Agency as a br@@ and of D@@ T@@ I to support SM@@ ME@@ s and co@@ ops . 
improving the un@@ employment rate from 3@@ 3 .@@ 1 in 2004 to 31 .@@ 8 in 2005 . This dec@@ rease in un@@ employment was in fact f@@ aster than the national aver@@ age , which dec@@ lin@@ ed from 27 .@@ 9 to 26 .@@ 5 over the same period . 
C@@ re@@ ating jobs and all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating poverty through targ@@ eted interventions in the second economy 
During the year we inv@@ ested R@@ 80 million in the social wel@@ f@@ are grants investigation which has yi@@ el@@ d@@ ed tr@@ em@@ end@@ ous value to the province . 25 ,@@ 9@@ 5@@ 6 fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent grants were identified in this investigation 
The deal flow that is currently under consideration by Ith@@ ala is standing at R1 .@@ 5@@ b@@ n . It is safe to sugg@@ est that between R@@ 5@@ 00@@ m to R1@@ b@@ n of those de@@ als would be wor@@ thy of funding . 
As import@@ antly , the payment process to SM@@ ME@@ s by Government De@@ part@@ ments le@@ av@@ es much to be d@@ esi@@ red . 
 this will have a positive impact on the rev@@ ival of U@@ l@@ undi as a regional centre . 
A ter@@ ti@@ ary cooper@@ ative will provide support to cooper@@ atives through ap@@ ex level institutions . It will also adv@@ oc@@ ate and engage organs of state , the private sector and the stak@@ eholders on behalf of its members . 
The second major infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related programme being adv@@ anced by the provincial government rel@@ ates to financial support for the development of s@@ occ@@ er stadi@@ ums in the province in prepar@@ ation for the 2010 World Cup . 
is that the ter@@ ti@@ ary cooper@@ ative should manage the enti@@ re value ch@@ ain , 
only by u@@ pl@@ if@@ ting the m@@ asses strugg@@ ling to surv@@ ive in the second economy will we be able to achieve sustain@@ ably higher growth rates over the longer term , and h@@ ence our end@@ -@@ go@@ al of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity for all . 
The growth of cooper@@ atives requires a major sh@@ ift in our strategy . Co@@ ops are a community mov@@ ement . For sustain@@ ability we need to institu@@ tion@@ alise the cooper@@ atives mov@@ ement . 
Other infrastruc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic projects we pro@@ pose to fund over the 2006/07 MTEF period are the two road cor@@ rid@@ ors leading to R@@ ich@@ ards Bay , nam@@ ely the L@@ ub@@ ombo SD@@ I cor@@ rid@@ or and the P@@ 7@@ 00 link@@ ing to U@@ l@@ undi and ul@@ tim@@ ately V@@ r@@ y@@ he@@ id .

The focus of agr@@ arian rev@@ olution projects and interventions will be on bo@@ os@@ ting the capacity of sec@@ ondary agricultural cooper@@ atives at the district level 
It must be emphas@@ ised that the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution conc@@ ept is not only about agricul@@ ture . It emb@@ rac@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of development of our rural areas , 
Appl@@ ic@@ ants who have applied to Ith@@ ala for lo@@ ans should not be sur@@ pr@@ ised therefore if their de@@ als end up being fin@@ anced by another financial institution

Acc@@ ess to mark@@ ets

Our message is@@ : 
The Fund is designed as a centr@@ al compon@@ ent of a small enterpr@@ ise l@@ ending framework , which seek@@ s not to comp@@ ete with other commercial SM@@ ME l@@ end@@ ers in the market , 
 the important thing is that all SM@@ ME business lo@@ an applications will be att@@ ended to within the coming year . 
N@@ ote that the funds will be held against the V@@ ote of the Provincial Treasury p@@ ending dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ement to the SM@@ ME Fund . 
The objective is to develop the provinces en@@ or@@ m@@ ous potential in agricul@@ ture into a competi@@ tive advant@@ age by util@@ ising all of its 5@@ 90 bi@@ o-@@ resource reg@@ ions to produce v@@ eget@@ ables , fr@@ uit and me@@ at products for export to Euro@@ p@@ e ,

A@@ noth@@ er key second economy inter@@ vention is that of the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution , whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to mo@@ ve sub@@ s@@ istence farm@@ ers up@@ wards towards the first economy . 
Business Par@@ t@@ ners in collabor@@ ation with Kh@@ ula , will work with Ith@@ ala to open access to Ith@@ ala applic@@ ants to the R1@@ 5@@ 0@@ m start up capital for SM@@ ME and B@@ E@@ E funding . 
Acc@@ ess to support for land re@@ form benefici@@ aries , and

The Department of Community Saf@@ ety & L@@ i@@ ais@@ on rece@@ ives R@@ 50 ,@@ 8 million this year , an increase of 5 .@@ 5 per cent . As the department received a substantial additional alloc@@ ation last year , there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget .

I tur@@ n now to the expenditure propos@@ als . In line with established practice and sound financial principles , the province is aim@@ ing at a bal@@ anced budget for the 2006/07 financial year 
In respect of the total budget alloc@@ ations for the 2006/07 financial year@@ : 
O@@ ver and above this , most departments will be receiving additional funding over the MTEF for specific purposes and projects , as indicated in T@@ able 3 in the print@@ ed spe@@ ech . 
with a view to ensuring the sustain@@ ability of the 20 major land res@@ titu@@ tion projects around the province . A T@@ ask Te@@ am coordin@@ ated by the Economic Techn@@ ical Cl@@ us@@ ter of Cabinet has already been established 
Treasury has eng@@ aged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate mod@@ el for the planning , coordin@@ ation , and approval of the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution projects . 
while service delivery issues and capacity cons@@ train@@ ts are also addres@@ sed in the budget propos@@ als . 
An amount of R@@ 40@@ m will be allocated to the Department of Economic Development in the 2006/07 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit . 
R2@@ 80 million for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure ; 
R@@ 5@@ 0@@ m of this increased alloc@@ ation is ear@@ mar@@ ked for the establishment of sec@@ ondary co@@ ops , R1@@ 00@@ m for primary co@@ ops , R@@ 3@@ 0@@ m for the inc@@ ub@@ ator programme , 
Trans@@ ports budget of R@@ 2 ,@@ 4@@ 16 billion in 2006/07 is an increase of 9 .@@ 9 per cent over last year . 
R1@@ 10 million to streng@@ then the F@@ E@@ T col@@ leg@@ es ; and 
Inv@@ esting in rev@@ ival of tow@@ n@@ ship econom@@ ies 
The budget propos@@ als will sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment , job cre@@ ation , poverty all@@ ev@@ iation , and broad@@ er participation in the economy 
from communities and interest groups across the province we are left with the firm im@@ pres@@ sion that this is tr@@ uly a budget for the people by the people of the province . 
N@@ ote that the amoun@@ ts per project are the total su@@ m over the three years of the 2006/07 MTEF period . It should also be no@@ ted that 
G@@ iven the limited resources , substantial re@@ prior@@ iti@@ z@@ ation and tr@@ ade@@ off@@ s had to be made this is of course the ess@@ ence of what the budg@@ eting process is all about . 
is the single most important imp@@ ed@@ im@@ ent to vi@@ ability and sustain@@ ability , and this aspec@@ t will be a major focus area of Ith@@ al@@ as Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated Economic Development Unit and the other rol@@ e-@@ players mentioned . 
Ith@@ ala is therefore in the process of establish@@ ing a new business unit called Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated Economic Development Unit , which will facilitate delivery in the following are@@ as@@ : 
The Department of S@@ port & Rec@@ re@@ ation is allocated a budget of R@@ 10@@ 6 ,@@ 1 million , a 19 .@@ 3 per cent increase over last year . 
and requires a high d@@ eg@@ ree of coordin@@ ation and cooper@@ ation between various provincial departments and district municipalities . The Department of Trans@@ ports African R@@ en@@ ais@@ s@@ ance Road U@@ p@@ grad@@ ing Programme , 
Once again Minister T@@ rev@@ or Man@@ u@@ el and the Te@@ am Finance have provided inv@@ al@@ u@@ able advice and guid@@ ance on the technical issues and national budget framework which under@@ p@@ in this budget . 
As expl@@ ained this dec@@ rease is attr@@ ibut@@ able to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget . The department n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess rece@@ ives 
F@@ ac@@ ilitation of new investment and increased trade within the Province 
However , the quality of information received from departments in their budget sub@@ missions in terms of their sp@@ ati@@ al sp@@ ending and service delivery g@@ aps was rel@@ atively in@@ complete and in@@ adequate . 
The budg@@ eted revenue for 2006/07 is made up as follow@@ s: 
the provincial budget act@@ ually grow@@ s by 13 .@@ 4 per cent over last years main budget , again exclud@@ ing the social security grant funding . This is not an in@@ consider@@ able increase , 
In his medi@@ um term budget policy statement , the Minister of Finance t@@ abled the div@@ ision of revenue between the three government spheres . 
There are many people who contr@@ ibu@@ ted to the budget propos@@ als which we table today . The support provided by the Premier H@@ on J@@ S Nd@@ eb@@ ele and my Cabinet Col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues is most sin@@ cer@@ ely ap@@ preci@@ ated . 
T@@ ot@@ al funding request by departments 
will be collec@@ tively sp@@ ending no less than R@@ 3@@ b@@ n over the for@@ th@@ coming MTEF on comb@@ ating HIV and A@@ ID@@ S , including the further exp@@ an@@ sion and rol@@ l@@ out of the P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al and hom@@ e-@@ based care programmes 
Ex@@ pan@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery 
Health is allocated a budget of R@@ 11 ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 7 billion , an increase of 13 .@@ 1 per cent . This rel@@ atively large per@@ cent@@ age increase refl@@ ects the high pri@@ ority which government , both national and provincial , 
but H@@ op@@ e sm@@ il@@ es at the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing , it will be happ@@ ier The 2006/07 Provincial budget process 
For the 2006/07 MTEF , a total of R@@ 9 ,@@ 7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments . This is against a total of R@@ 4 ,@@ 6 billion available in the provincial resource en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e . 
In short , I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proc@@ eed , on sch@@ edule , along our jour@@ ney to pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity for all . 
Economic Development g@@ ets R@@ 3@@ 90 ,@@ 1 million in 2006/07 , a 17@@ 7 per cent increase over last year . Be@@ fore I am acc@@ used of ne@@ pot@@ ism , let me draw attention to the fact that 
who have once again have played a most construc@@ tive role in eng@@ aging with Treasury on budg@@ et@@ ary and financial management issues . 
K@@ Z@@ N@@ s share of additional funding 
The third area which government is prior@@ it@@ ising in this budget rel@@ ates to exp@@ and@@ ing and improving the quality of existing programmes and projects . O@@ f no@@ te are the following alloc@@ ation@@ s: 
and ou@@ ter two years of the MTEF period . The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 2005@@ /0@@ 6 financial year , nam@@ ely R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 2 billion , is allocated to the various provincial departments . 
Be@@ fore Honourable Members become al@@ armed , however , I should expl@@ ain that the dec@@ rease is enti@@ rel@@ y attr@@ ibut@@ able to the removal of the social security condi@@ tional grant funding from the provincial budg@@ ets al@@ together 
This exercise rev@@ e@@ aled that ind@@ eed we are funding these national prior@@ ities more than adequ@@ ately , and all the national pri@@ ority programmes have been allocated heal@@ thy increas@@ es in their bas@@ el@@ ine budg@@ ets over the 2006/07 MTEF . 
in accordance with their legislative mand@@ ates and any sec@@ tor@@ -@@ specific nor@@ ms and standards . 
It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget sub@@ missions . If noth@@ ing el@@ se , this approach has b@@ rought about a change in the m@@ ind@@ set of departments 
For the 2006/07 financial year , the province is budg@@ eting for total revenue of R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 1 billion . This re@@ presents a dec@@ rease of 18 ,@@ 4 per cent as compar@@ ed to last years main budget . 
E@@ P@@ W@@ P and B@@ B@@ B@@ E@@ E principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and maint@@ en@@ anc@@ e-@@ related projects . 
This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department , in the amount of R@@ 18 ,@@ 9 million , as well as R@@ 4@@ m for the carr@@ y-@@ through costs of the 2005@@ /0@@ 6 ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments estim@@ ate . 
R2@@ 90 million for Ad@@ ul@@ t Bas@@ ic Education & Training ; 
in terms of the number of new ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s enter@@ ing the market , there is a need to create better focus within Ith@@ ala in order to accel@@ er@@ ate delivery in this all important empow@@ erment initi@@ ative . 
The R@@ oy@@ al Hous@@ ehold rece@@ ives R@@ 31 ,@@ 4 million in 2006/07 , an increase of 13 .@@ 8 per cent over last year .

additional funding tot@@ all@@ ing R@@ 9@@ 7 ,@@ 5@@ m as a result of the phas@@ ing in of the F@@ ood Rel@@ ief and HIV and A@@ ID@@ S grants . Al@@ though not in our budget the condi@@ tional grant for social assistance grants 
I am confid@@ ent however that we have succ@@ eed@@ ed in form@@ ul@@ ating budget propos@@ als which tr@@ uly refl@@ ect the provincial policy prior@@ ities as approved by the provincial executive , and will go a long way towards satisf@@ ying the as@@ pir@@ ations of pop@@ ular expec@@ t@@ ations .

The purpose of this sp@@ ati@@ al exercise was to mo@@ ve towards att@@ aining a comprehensive economic al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment strategy for the province , by tr@@ ying to identify provincial departments sp@@ ending

Prom@@ o@@ tion of commercial , as well as vi@@ able sub@@ s@@ istence farm@@ ing in previously dis@@ advant@@ aged communities 
Mr Speaker , I tur@@ n now to the det@@ ail of the provincial budget propos@@ als for the 2006/07 MTEF . 
Mr Speaker , we remain committed for example to continue w@@ aging a rel@@ ent@@ less campaign to comb@@ at the r@@ av@@ aging effec@@ ts of the HIV and A@@ ID@@ S sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome on our society . To this end provincial departments 
And dem@@ and@@ ing , because p@@ ut@@ ting budg@@ ets together , which involv@@ es making informed cho@@ ices and mat@@ ching limited resources against comp@@ eting needs and dem@@ ands , is never an eas@@ y process . 
for the carr@@ y@@ - through costs of the 2005@@ /0@@ 6 ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments estim@@ ate , new pos@@ ts and I@@ T support and systems . 
I also wish to ext@@ end my than@@ ks to the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Por@@ t@@ fol@@ io Committee , Mr C@@ y@@ r@@ il X@@ aba and his Committee , 
Mr Speaker , compil@@ ing these budget propos@@ als has been both a pl@@ eas@@ ur@@ able and dem@@ and@@ ing task . P@@ le@@ as@@ ur@@ able , in that there has been tr@@ em@@ end@@ ously positive in@@ put and advice received 
R2@@ 9@@ m for the Community Development Wor@@ k@@ ers programme , R@@ 24 ,@@ 1 million for Pro@@ ject Con@@ sol@@ id@@ ate , Dis@@ aster Management C@@ ent@@ res and the R@@ ural Con@@ nec@@ tiv@@ ity Programme , 
The Hous@@ ing budget records a substantial le@@ ap to R1 ,@@ 2@@ 5@@ 2 billion , an increase of no less than 29 .@@ 1 per cent over last year . 
and there is lit@@ tle dou@@ b@@ t that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliver on its mand@@ ate to the elec@@ tor@@ ate . 
 this funding has been trans@@ fer@@ red to the new@@ ly established Social Security Agency at a national level . T@@ aking out the social security grant funding of some R1@@ 3 ,@@ 8@@ b@@ n in 2006/07 , 
The Department of Wor@@ ks rece@@ ives R@@ 4@@ 5@@ 1 ,@@ 5 million this year , an increase of 6 .@@ 0 per cent over the 2005@@ /0@@ 6 budget . 
This includes additional funding of R1@@ 10@@ m as mentioned for the agr@@ arian rev@@ olution programme , 
The main reason for the dec@@ rease is that Treasury will no longer have the centr@@ alised P@@ overty Al@@ lev@@ iation Fund held against its budget , 
The Provincial Treasury rece@@ ives R1 ,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 9 billion , a nomin@@ al dec@@ rease of 1 .@@ 8 per cent over last years main budget . 
The primary focus of the 2006/07 Treasury Gu@@ id@@ elines was on the review and re@@ prior@@ it@@ isation of departments budg@@ ets , as well as on an analys@@ is of their sp@@ ati@@ al sp@@ ending and service delivery in each district municipality . 
The expenditure framework provides for R@@ 31 billion in additional equitable share alloc@@ ation to the provinces over the MTEF . 
while even the bal@@ ance of the Provincial G@@ row@@ th Fund and SM@@ ME Fund will only be ho@@ used in T@@ reas@@ ur@@ y@@ s budget on a temporary basis , p@@ ending approval of projects and consequ@@ ent transfer of funds to the Ith@@ ala 
 this is the total expenditure across the De@@ part@@ ments of Health , Social W@@ el@@ f@@ are and Education . The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty all@@ ev@@ iation programmes in their respective budget documentation . 
The Department of Ar@@ ts , C@@ ul@@ ture and Tourism rece@@ ives a budget of R2@@ 5@@ 4 ,@@ 7 million , a 21 .@@ 6 per cent increase over last year . This includes an additional alloc@@ ation of R@@ 18 ,@@ 7 million 
with the mand@@ ate to ensure that the commercial enterprises ear@@ mar@@ ked for the major land res@@ titu@@ tion projects such as g@@ ame farm@@ ing and ec@@ ot@@ ourism , 
R@@ 40@@ m for the Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated Development Unit in Ith@@ ala , and R@@ 20@@ m for the Dube Trade Port . Pre@@ vi@@ ously these funds were k@@ ept in Treasury before they were trans@@ fer@@ red to Ith@@ ala . 
Mr Speaker , I have deal@@ t at leng@@ th with the major policy prior@@ ities and therefore I wish to br@@ ief@@ ly expl@@ ain the div@@ ision of revenue and MTEF framework which under@@ p@@ ins this provincial budget . 
The Office of the Premier is allocated R 2@@ 9@@ 4 ,@@ 7 million , an increase of 35 .@@ 1 per cent over the 2005@@ /0@@ 6 budget . This large increase is mainly attr@@ ibut@@ able to an alloc@@ ation of R@@ 5@@ 0@@ m 
The Department of Local Government and Tr@@ aditional Affairs g@@ ets R@@ 5@@ 9@@ 5 ,@@ 6 million , a 29 .@@ 9 per cent increase . 
Other key rol@@ e-@@ players include the De@@ part@@ ments of Economic Development , Hous@@ ing , Ar@@ ts , C@@ ul@@ ture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land Cla@@ im@@ s Commission . 
We are also recomm@@ ending additional alloc@@ ations in order to help departments increase their intern@@ al capacity and improve service delivery . 
continues to acc@@ ord to the delivery of social services , and includes an additional alloc@@ ation of R@@ 24 ,@@ 6 million for improving maintenance in hosp@@ it@@ als . 
Mr Speaker , I want to emphas@@ ise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for alloc@@ ation should be ap@@ por@@ tioned among departments and programmes , we did a comprehensive cos@@ ting and ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king exercise 
Ex@@ p@@ end@@ iture propos@@ als and depart@@ mental alloc@@ ations 
This alloc@@ ation will also support the regulatory activities of the G@@ amb@@ ling Board . A request from the Department of Hous@@ ing for additional capacity has also been recomm@@ ended to support various initiatives such as training of housing benefici@@ aries . 
T@@ able 1 in the print@@ ed spe@@ ech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further alloc@@ ation , taking into account pro@@ jec@@ ted provincial own revenue and two national policy direc@@ tives ;

In the past , the value of coastal ecos@@ yst@@ ems as a cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one for development was not suffici@@ ently acknowled@@ ged in dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making in South Africa . 
The Bill int@@ ends to regul@@ ate the dis@@ charge of eff@@ lu@@ ent into coastal wat@@ ers from any sour@@ ce on land by requir@@ ing permits to author@@ ise such dis@@ charges . 
However , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the Prot@@ ected A@@ re@@ as Act rather than the proposed Int@@ egr@@ ated Co@@ astal Management Act . 
The purpose of this Gu@@ ide is to facilitate mean@@ ing@@ ful and informed public participation during the 90 day comm@@ ents period . 
The Wh@@ ite P@@ aper did not m@@ er@@ ely provide a vision , principles , go@@ als and objectives for coastal management in South Africa .

The Wh@@ ite P@@ aper recomm@@ ended new arrangements to coordin@@ ate coastal management in South Africa . 
Section 4@@ 9 requires the al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment of certain plans with CM@@ P@@ s to ensure coordin@@ ated coastal management . S@@ im@@ il@@ arly section 50 requires consist@@ ency between CM@@ P@@ s and other stat@@ ut@@ ory plans . 
P@@ ending the determination of an appeal , the Minister or MEC may make an inter@@ im order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act . 
The powers of the Minister and the ME@@ C@@ s to review provincial and municipal CM@@ P@@ s respec@@ tively are set out in sections 5@@ 3@@ -@@ 5@@ 4 .

The Bill provides procedures relating to both dis@@ charge and d@@ um@@ ping permits . 
This Part also provides str@@ ict guidelines for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making which the permit issu@@ ing authority must consider . 
Section 5@@ 7 requires us@@ ers of coastal public property , ow@@ ners and occup@@ iers of land , coastal man@@ agers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avo@@ id ca@@ using adver@@ se effec@@ ts on the coastal environment 
The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CM@@ P@@ s with@@ in@@ four years of the commenc@@ ement of the Act that are consistent with the national CM@@ P and the National Est@@ u@@ ar@@ ine Management Prot@@ oc@@ ol . 
Prot@@ ected areas or parts thereof are aut@@ om@@ a@@ tically included in the bu@@ ff@@ er zone in terms of Section 16 . The purpose of section 22 is to enable the MEC 
Part 4 de@@ als with the let@@ ting of coastal public property by way of coastal le@@ as@@ es and the gran@@ ting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal conc@@ es@@ sions . 
This contr@@ as@@ ts with the current situation under the Se@@ ash@@ ore Act where the se@@ ash@@ ore and se@@ a are owned by the President on behalf of the people .@@ Co@@ astal public property is made up pr@@ im@@ arily of the se@@ ash@@ ore and coastal wat@@ ers . 
After the Cabinet approved the Wh@@ ite P@@ aper a comprehensive legal review was carried out . I@@ ts purpose was to determine whether the Wh@@ ite P@@ aper could be implemented in terms of existing laws . 
E@@ arly dr@@ af@@ ts of the Int@@ egr@@ ated Co@@ astal Management Bill included det@@ ailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas . 
Section 35 establish@@ es a National Co@@ astal Committee which will function at national government level . Section 36 author@@ iz@@ es the Minister to determine the com@@ position of the Committee . 
Section 40 author@@ iz@@ es the ME@@ C@@ s to appoint V@@ olun@@ t@@ ary coastal officers and def@@ ine their rol@@ es and responsibilities . 
The prot@@ oc@@ ol will provide a national policy for est@@ u@@ ary management and gu@@ ide the development of individual est@@ u@@ ar@@ ine management plans . 
D@@ em@@ ar@@ c@@ ation procedures to change the bo@@ und@@ aries of the coastal bu@@ ff@@ er zone are only lik@@ ely to be institu@@ ted where the area designated by the Act is in@@ appropriate and imp@@ ed@@ es effective coastal management . 
This provision hel@@ ps facilitate a new cooper@@ ative and particip@@ atory approach to man@@ aging the co@@ ast by enh@@ ancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management . 
In@@ clud@@ es: vision , provincial CM@@ O@@ s . 
The coastal resource use planning system established by this Chapter will function as a mechanis@@ m for control@@ ling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is present@@ ly used . 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental fac@@ tors . 
It took a st@@ ep further by providing a Plan of Ac@@ tion which out@@ lin@@ es in det@@ ail how the Wh@@ ite P@@ aper is to be implemented . One of the el@@ ements of this Plan of Ac@@ tion is In@@ stitu@@ tional and Leg@@ al Development . 
However , this system ori@@ ent@@ ated approach has fail@@ ed to mater@@ i@@ al@@ ize to date and various sectors of government continue to adop@@ t a management approach foc@@ using 
Co@@ astal wat@@ ers are ess@@ enti@@ ally all wat@@ ers influ@@ enced by ti@@ d@@ es and the se@@ a out to the lim@@ its of the ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ial se@@ a . 
rather than as conservation areas . For example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable har@@ v@@ esting of sh@@ ell@@ fish for sub@@ s@@ istence purposes in areas where such har@@ v@@ esting is present@@ ly de@@ pl@@ eting the sh@@ ell@@ fish resources . 
Section 5@@ 9 provides for the Minister or MEC to issue written no@@ tices requir@@ ing measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment . 
The Minister po@@ int@@ ed out that due to its compl@@ ex@@ ity the Bill would be available for public com@@ ment for a period of 90 days . 
This Bill prom@@ otes a hol@@ istic way of th@@ ink@@ ing by promoting coordin@@ ated and integrated coastal management , which view@@ s the co@@ ast as a system and emphas@@ iz@@ es the importance of man@@ aging it as such . 
The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estim@@ ated in 1998 to be about R1@@ 6@@ 8 billion ann@@ ually , which was equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to about 35 of our annual G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Pro@@ duc@@ t .

There is a prohib@@ ition against over@@ sel@@ ling and over@@ book@@ ing , which requires a supplier not to accept consideration for any goods or services unless they reasonably expec@@ t to have capacity to supply them or int@@ end to provide goods or services that are mater@@ ially different .

The right to cho@@ ose also includes the right of the consumer to canc@@ el advance reserv@@ ations or book@@ ings , but suppliers may charge advance dep@@ os@@ its and im@@ pose reasonable cancell@@ ation penal@@ ties .
The d@@ ti believ@@ es that consumers have a right , and need , to be able to as@@ certain the identity of the legal person with whom they are dealing .
or the Minister has conclud@@ ed that the existing provincial consumer protection authority is un@@ able to perform that function effec@@ tively .
U@@ p@@ front dis@@ clos@@ ure for prepar@@ ing an estim@@ ate is also required .
Th@@ ere@@ fore , clause 5 provides for the Minister to grant indus@@ tr@@ y-@@ wide exemp@@ tions from the application of specific provisions of this Bill on the request of a relevant industry regul@@ ator , if the National Consumer Commission adv@@ ises that the specific industry scheme offers at least as much protection for consumers as they would have under this Bill .
The Bill recogn@@ ises the role of civil society in consumer protection by providing for the support of any jur@@ istic person or association of persons that meet the set cr@@ iter@@ ia as consumer protection groups .
Consumer Affairs Act , 198@@ 8 Trade Pr@@ ac@@ tices Act , 197@@ 6 S@@ ale and Service M@@ at@@ ters Act , 196@@ 4 Business Nam@@ es Act , 19@@ 60 Bus@@ inesses Act , 199@@ 1 Pr@@ ice Cont@@ rol Act , 196@@ 4 Sec@@ tions 2 to 13 and sections 16 to 17 of the M@@ er@@ ch@@ and@@ ise Mar@@ ks Act , 19@@ 41 Section 5@@ 4 of the L@@ ot@@ ter@@ ies Act , 1997 , and related regulations .
Clause 26 s@@ ets out dis@@ clos@@ ure requirements that inter@@ medi@@ aries who are not regulated under another law have to comply with .
Clause 17 des@@ crib@@ es cir@@ cum@@ -@@ stances under which a cancell@@ ation penal@@ ty may be considered un@@ reasonable .
notice or instruc@@ tions of safe handl@@ ing of goods ;
In addition , it will allow suppliers to targ@@ et their marketing to specific population groups to the extent that is reasonable , having regard to the goods and services being offered .
However , the supplier can exc@@ eed the original estim@@ ate if the consumer in writing dec@@ lin@@ es the estim@@ ate or pre-@@ author@@ ises any charges up to a specified maximum .
Th@@ us , dep@@ ending on the context , a consumer means a person to whom goods or services are mark@@ eted in the ordinary course of business ; a person who has entered into an agreement or transaction with a supplier ;
The Bill applies to goods or services whether promo@@ ted by a for prof@@ it business , or by a non-@@ prof@@ it entity , the State or enti@@ ties contr@@ acted by the State , including Public Pr@@ iv@@ ate Par@@ t@@ nerships .
Suppl@@ iers of rep@@ air , maintenance or replac@@ ement services cannot charge consumers for these services unless the consumer was provided with an estim@@ ate which the consumer has authorised .
The Bill regul@@ ates lo@@ yalty programmes by requir@@ ing spon@@ s@@ ors of lo@@ yalty programmes to meet their obligations when lo@@ yalty cred@@ its are tend@@ ered , prohib@@ its off@@ ering in@@ fer@@ ior quality products or requir@@ ing the b@@ un@@ dl@@ ing of re@@ ward goods or services with revenue products , requires a supplier to accept the tender of sufficient lo@@ yalty cred@@ its as adequate consideration for goods and services at any time , subject to limited bl@@ ack@@ -@@ out peri@@ ods .
In addition , clause 2 specifically provides that in case of a conflict between this Bill and any other law prot@@ ecting consumers within an industry , the laws are to be enforc@@ ed con@@ currently , as far as possible , and bey@@ ond that , the law that provides the gre@@ ater d@@ eg@@ ree of protection for consumers is to prev@@ ail .
Clause 8@@ 2 establish@@ es a scheme for the development through consultation of industry cod@@ es of conduct relating to consumer matters , and provides for them to receive the force of law by being prescribed by the Minister .
If a third party has a legal claim over the goods , the supplier is liable to that third party , unless it can be sh@@ own that the supplier and consumer coll@@ ud@@ ed to de@@ fr@@ a@@ ud the third party .
Cer@@ tain agreements or provisions of agreements are listed as un@@ lawful in clause 5@@ 1 , and are vo@@ id from inc@@ ep@@ tion ir@@ respective of the common law or provision of other laws .
The Bill aims to cod@@ if@@ y and improve on the common law by addres@@ sing unfair contract terms and provide consumers with rem@@ ed@@ ies where there have been bre@@ aches of contract .
Clause 6@@ 3 provides that pre@@ paid certif@@ icates , cred@@ its and v@@ ou@@ ch@@ ers remain negoti@@ able for up to five years , and that the supplier is oblig@@ ated to hon@@ our them when present@@ ed .
Clause 22 out@@ lin@@ es the circumstances under which a document would be considered to be in pl@@ ain language , and the Commission may publ@@ ish guidelines for meth@@ ods ass@@ essing whether a document satisf@@ ies that requir@@ ement .
The Bill re@@ tain@@ s the existing prohib@@ i@@ tions against fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent sch@@ em@@ es and offers , p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id and related sch@@ em@@ es .
The d@@ ti believ@@ es that large trans@@ actions involv@@ ing large businesses and the State do not require the protection offered by the Bill because they would benefit from the fl@@ ex@@ ib@@ ility of oper@@ ating in an un@@ regulated market . Th@@ ere@@ fore , the Bill will not apply to trans@@ actions when the consumer is the State , or any organ of state ;
New provisions in clause 45 aim to ensure f@@ air@@ ness in a@@ uc@@ tions by regul@@ ating the participation of ow@@ ners or their ag@@ ents as b@@ id@@ ders , and requir@@ ing notice of any res@@ erve b@@ id or up@@ set price .
Clause 3@@ 3 establish@@ es standards for the conduct of cat@@ al@@ og@@ ue sal@@ es , clause 34 regul@@ ates the use of trade c@@ ou@@ p@@ ons , and clause 3@@ 7 regul@@ ates the marketing of work from home sch@@ em@@ es .
The provisions regarding the cr@@ iter@@ ia for , and registration of , business names have been rev@@ ised , mod@@ er@@ n@@ ised and har@@ mon@@ ised with propos@@ als under discus@@ sion for cr@@ iter@@ ia applicable to companies in terms of the Companies Act .
To enable consumers to exercise this right the Act provides for consumers to make a formal demand to a mark@@ eter to dis@@ continue any such approach to that consumer , and it contempl@@ ates the establishment of an Ex@@ clus@@ ion Regis@@ ter either by industry or by the Commission .
The Bill will apply to most trans@@ actions in the ordinary course of business between parties within the Republic , to the promotion of goods and services that could lead to such trans@@ actions , and to the goods and services themselves after the transaction is completed .
The Bill further s@@ ets out the matters over which provincial consumer protection authorities have jurisdiction in respect of activities oc@@ curr@@ ing or application by per@@ -@@ s@@ ons carr@@ ying on business exclus@@ iv@@ ely within their provinces , including issu@@ ing , on behalf of the Commission , of compliance no@@ tices ;
Prov@@ isions that se@@ ek to lim@@ it the suppliers li@@ ability must be specifically and cons@@ pic@@ u@@ ously b@@ rought to the attention of the consumer , as out@@ lin@@ ed in clause 4@@ 9 .
or the inter@@ action concer@@ ns the supply or potential supply of goods or services to or at the direction of the consumer .
This includes franchise trans@@ actions or agreements as described in clause 5 .
Clause 14 establish@@ es the consumers right to canc@@ el a fix@@ ed@@ -@@ term agreement , lim@@ its the rights of suppliers to im@@ pose cancell@@ ation charges , and s@@ ets out rules govern@@ ing the expir@@ ing of such agreements .
It provides that consumers have a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are intended , of good quality , in good working order , free of def@@ ects , and us@@ e@@ able and d@@ ur@@ able for a reasonable period of time .
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently contr@@ acts are regulated in terms of the common law .
Any rep@@ airs or maintenance cost above the original estim@@ ate has to be authorised by the consumer .
Consum@@ ers have to be informed and provided with the identity of the ag@@ ents or person and informed of their right to res@@ c@@ ind the agreement during the co@@ ol@@ ing@@ -@@ off period .
In terms of clause 4@@ 4 , the consumer has the right to ass@@ ume , and it is an impl@@ ied term of every transaction , that the supplier or l@@ ess@@ or has legal right to sel@@ l or lease the goods for full title of the goods to p@@ ass to the consumer .
S@@ uch a register would allow consumers to pre-@@ emp@@ tively bloc@@ k direct marketing appro@@ aches .
Clause 9 s@@ ets out a small number of well-@@ defined , long@@ -@@ standing and wid@@ ely accepted commercial practices that allow differ@@ ential treatment of consumers of a particular se@@ x , age or gender , and st@@ ates that those practices are not to be cons@@ tru@@ ed as unfair discrimin@@ ation , if the conduct is reasonable .
Ac@@ cred@@ ited consumer protection groups may also en@@ force consumer rights by commenc@@ ing or under@@ taking any lawful act to protect the interests of a consumer individ@@ ually or a group of consumers collec@@ tively in any matter or before any for@@ um contemplated in the Bill ;
If two pr@@ ices are displayed for the same goods , the low@@ est has to be charged .
a us@@ er of the goods or a re@@ cip@@ i@@ ent or benefici@@ ary of the services ;
Clause 32 out@@ lin@@ es standards to be ad@@ h@@ ered to when suppliers engage in direct marketing .
In addition to their jurisdiction to he@@ ar a matter initi@@ ated directly by a consumer , the courts have jurisdiction to he@@ ar appe@@ als against Tribunal decisions , and may order suppliers to al@@ ter or dis@@ continue certain practices , aw@@ ard damag@@ es against suppliers for coll@@ ective inj@@ ury to all or a class of consumers , to be paid to any person on any terms that the court might decide .
In addition , there is a general prohib@@ ition against consumers being sub@@ jec@@ ted to unfair discrimin@@ ation when they are enter@@ ing into a transaction or agreement , and in all aspec@@ ts of the conduct of the supplier towards the consumer in the course of the transaction .
The Bill identif@@ ies the following el@@ ements that make a transaction a consumer transaction , and th@@ us br@@ ing@@ ing it within the s@@ cope of the Bill if it is an inter@@ action or agreement to inter@@ act between a consumer and supplier in the ordinary course of the suppliers business , including in terms of any public regulation ;
If a complaint is made to the Commission , it will investigate , and may make a referr@@ al to the Tribunal , which may res@@ olve the matter by making certain orders as contemplated in clause 75 .
notice on how to in@@ hib@@ it any risk associated with the use of goods , and to rem@@ ed@@ y or m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate the effec@@ ts , and provide for the safe disposal of the goods .
Un@@ der certain circumstances , as described in clause 21 , goods or services delivered to or performed for consumers may be regarded as un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited , in which case the con@@ -@@ sum@@ er has no oblig@@ ation to pay for them , and the return of the goods to the supplier is at the suppliers own risk and exp@@ ense .
The Bill would hold suppliers accoun@@ table to consumers for any money or other property belong@@ ing to the consumer , but held by the supplier under any agreement , including advance payments for services to be supplied at a later date .
However , this does not apply to used goods or im@@ mov@@ able property .
If a complaint ar@@ ises in an industry in which a stat@@ ut@@ ory omb@@ ud scheme is in place , the consumer must pursu@@ e a resolution through that scheme before making a complaint to the Commission .
C@@ ause 60 cre@@ ates a framework for industry cod@@ es to be developed , establish@@ ing sch@@ em@@ es of product safety monitoring and , if needed , product rec@@ all .
This Part aims to saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the safety of consumers and to establish a reg@@ ime of product li@@ ability , ir@@ respective of neg@@ lig@@ ence on the part of anyone in the supply ch@@ ain , which currently does not ex@@ ist in South Africa .
The Commission would have authority to order an investigation and rec@@ all of any dang@@ er@@ ous or def@@ ective products c@@ overed by any such industry code .
If a complaint under this Part is direc@@ ted to the Commission , it will be referred to the equality court .
there is an exchange of consideration ;
R@@ ight to priv@@ acy
The Bill provides for a general right for consumers to receive goods that are of good quality and free from def@@ ects , as described in clause 55 .
However , an exc@@ ep@@ tion is allowed where the consumer has been expres@@ s@@ ly informed of the condition of the goods and has expres@@ s@@ ly agreed to bu@@ y them in that particular state .
The d@@ ti believ@@ es that having informed and active consumers will enh@@ ance market and price competition .
Any print@@ ed information , document or notice that the Bill requires a supplier to pro@@ -@@ duce , provide or deliver to a consumer must satisf@@ y the pl@@ ain language requirements of clause 22 .
The use of a th@@ res@@ hold will me@@ an that the protection of the Bill will ext@@ end to small sh@@ op@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s and other businesses , when they make ro@@ ut@@ ine or min@@ or purch@@ as@@ es for the purpose of their business . However , des@@ pite those exc@@ ep@@ tions , cl@@ a@@ uses 60 and 6@@ 1 , which deal with un@@ safe goods , will apply to all goods introduc@@ ed to the market , even if they were the subject of an exemp@@ t transaction .
facilit@@ ation of settl@@ ement of any dispute between the Commission and any provincial consumer protection authority ;
In terms of clause 7@@ 7 , activities that may be suppor@@ ted are consumer advice and education , research , market monitoring , surv@@ e@@ ill@@ ance and repor@@ ting , the promotion of consumer rights and lob@@ b@@ ying , representation of consumers , alternative dispute resolution through medi@@ ation and conc@@ iliation and participation in national and international associ@@ ations and confer@@ ences .
