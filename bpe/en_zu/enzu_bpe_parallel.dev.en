These hearings will take place 17@@ -@@ 21 May 2010 in three provinces . 
A@@ d Ho@@ c Committee on Service Delivery (@@ CH@@ ANG@@ E OF DA@@ TE@@ ) 
The public hearings at Parliament took place on 2@@ n@@ d 4@@ th February 2010 . 
During its visit to the provinces , the Committee will undertake site inspections and meet with members of the communities , local government officials , provincial government department officials , ward committees , civil society organizations , and members of the business fraternity . 
Members of the public are invited to the public hearings that are scheduled to take place in the various provinces as follows: 
The National Assembly established the A@@ d Ho@@ c Committee to conduct coordinated oversight on service delivery under the theme Working together to ensure the delivery of quality service to communities . 
To this end , the Committee undertook coordinated visits in rural and urban areas , and conduct public hearings at Parliament and in the provinces . 
The mandate of the Committee is to enquire into the progress with regard to service delivery and where protests took place what the challenges are in order to table a report to the National Assembly with clear , 
And early the next morning , the young women carried him back down to the well again .
No , they said .
Well lets see if my secret ad@@ m@@ irer will come and fetch me ? said Sky Maiden when she saw the purse full of money .
Then , when she had read it , What should we do ?
I@@ ve been watching you , Frog said .
What do we do now ? the Sun Chief asked his wife , but the Moon Lady wasnt interested in his problems .
It was at this point , when Kimana was just beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his letter delivered , that Frog approached him .
An Ad@@ m@@ irer
You may marry my daughter if you come and fetch her , Kimana mo@@ aned , reading the Sun Chiefs second letter .
Then you took a purse full of money , which was very brave of you , but I really dont believe you can fetch Sky Maiden , too .
Kimana was a young man in love .
Y@@ oul@@ l take a purse full of money up to heaven ? said Kimana .
After the Sun Chief had de@@ parted , Frog put the letter in his mouth , climbed into an empty j@@ ug and waited to be carried back down to Earth .
Rab@@ bit , he asked , would you be so kind as to take this letter to the Sun Chief for me , please ?
So the Sun Chief wrote a reply describing his daug@@ h@@ ters request then left it on the table next to the water jugs .
Can a f@@ rog lead a woman ? she asked .
D@@ ont ask me !
De@@ ar Sun Chief
When the young women wer@@ ent looking Frog jumped into one of the jugs where he stayed hidden until they climbed back up to heaven .
After giving the matter some thought he decided that the best thing to do was to write a letter to the Sun Chief simply stating his wish .
And Kimana ?
Did you put this letter in my room ? he asked .
Then I brought you a purse full of money .
First I took a letter to Heav@@ en , didnt I ?
Then Ill fetch her for you , said Frog .
You may marry my daughter if you bring me a purse full of money , Kimana read , looking upset .
No , said the girls .
How can this be ?
Are you m@@ ad ?
First you took a letter to Heav@@ en .
Then its you that I shall marry , she said , not my secret ad@@ m@@ irer .
And after that I got you to come down to Earth .
No way !
Well , at least Ill try , he said .
Af@@ ter@@ wards , Frog took the letter to Kimana .
Not long afterwards the Sun Chief came into his room for a drink of water , saw the letter then summon@@ ed the young women who had been down to the well for him .
Ask your daughter ! she muttered .
What must I do now ? he asked .
The Sky Maiden looked at him .
So the Sun Chief wrote a second letter , which he left on the table , just as before .
Well , h@@ es still looking for a wife , Im afr@@ aid .
Im@@ pressed , the Sky Maiden thought about this for a moment .
Yes , of course , prot@@ ested Frog .
HOW F@@ RO@@ G W@@ ENT TO HE@@ A@@ VE@@ N
So , for the third time Frog climbed back into the well and the next morning the young women came with their jugs and carried him up to heaven , but this time , when he was alone he sp@@ at in all the jugs of water - P@@ tu@@ i .
After that , Frog and the Sky Maiden returned to heaven together where they were married and lived happ@@ ily ever after .
What Kimana didnt know was that Frog lived near a well that the young women who served the Sun Chief visited every day .
Frog , who was a f@@ rog of few words , merely shrugged .
Again , Kimana thought about F@@ rog@@ s offer .
Ask your daughter ! snapped Moon Lady .
How Frog went to Heav@@ en
In the end , Kimana turned to his friend Rab@@ bit for help .
What ?
So he went to his wife again .
However , the Sky Maiden was the daughter of the Sun Chief , who was a very powerful and important person and for this reason Kimana wasnt quite sure how to proceed with his cour@@ tsh@@ ip .
In heaven , the young women placed the water jugs in the Sun Chiefs room then left .
No , Im afr@@ aid thats not possible .
Kimana looked at Frog for a moment then he shrugged .
Then he went to Haw@@ k who offered to take it half way , but no further , which wasnt really much help , of course .
Read this , he said , handing her the letter .
Take it to heaven ?
Now he has sent an evil spirit in the shape of a f@@ rog and this is the cause of all the s@@ ick@@ ness .
The next morning Frog hid in the well again , only this time instead of having a letter in his mouth , he had a purse full of money .
Did you bring me this purse full of money today ? he asked them .
Again , Frog put the letter in his mouth and climbed into an empty j@@ ug .
Well , what have I got to lose ? he said finally , handing over the letter .
Then he went to see the young women who had been down to Earth to fetch water for him .
O@@ K , he said finally , reaching under his jacket .
O@@ K , then Ill take it for you , said Frog .
Take your letter to heaven ? he said .
Rab@@ bit star@@ ed at him like he had gone off his head .
I cant go and fetch her .
But Kimana shook his head .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly the same thing happened : the young women who served the Sun Chief climbed down from heaven singing their song and when they lowered their water jugs into the well , Frog jumped into one .
Please take it to heaven for me .
Well , at least Ill try , answered Frog .
And so the next day , the Sky Maiden went down to the well with the serving girls , but she stayed behind when all the other young women returned to heaven .
Angola , which is roughly the same size as South Africa but has only about one-@@ quarter the population , is situated to the north of Botswana and Namibia .
I am human and live on Earth and I want to marry your daughter , Sky Maiden .
The next morning , the same young women collected the water jugs - including the one containing Frog - and climbed down to Earth , singing their song as they went Good day to you , my sister .
And , just as before , Frog ended up in the Sun Chiefs room , where he sp@@ at out the purse full of money and then hid in a corner .
Why dont you take the letter yourself ?
And when Frog was quite certain that he was alone he jumped out of the j@@ ug , sp@@ it the letter onto the table and hid in a corner .
They all shook their heads .
I cant do that , he said , sh@@ aking his head .
He was in love with the Sky Maiden , whom he wanted to marry .
So he next went to An@@ tel@@ ope who also refused to deliver the letter .
When the people of the house dr@@ ank the water from the well they all became so sick the Sun Chief had to summon a spirit doctor who first examined all the evidence then said , You promised your daughter to a man of Earth , but she has not gone .
Kimana looked at him in amaz@@ ement .
Ask your daughter ! said Moon Lady , irrit@@ ably w@@ aving him away with her hand .
P@@ tu@@ i before hiding in a corner of the room again .
Having finished his letter , Kimana then had to get it delivered , which was easier said than done because the Sun Chief and his daughter both lived in heaven .
She had only been waiting a few moments when Frog climbed out of the well and sat in front of her .
Whatever I was asked to do , I did .
I will go down to Earth , the Sky Maiden said when her father told her what the spirit doctor had said .
L@@ ets ask the writ@@ er to bring me a wed@@ ding gift , said Sky Maiden a short while later after she too had read the letter .
When they lowered their jugs into the well to ref@@ ill them , Frog jumped out .
Just after day@@ break the young women climbed down out of the sky and visited the well singing the song they always sang when they collected water - Good day to you , my sister .
He only climbed out of the well when the young women had gone back to heaven .
Lu@@ anda , the capital , is a large sea port on the Atlantic coast .
Good day to you after which they lowered their jugs into the water .
What cant you do ? asked Frog .
I cant take a purse full of money up to heaven , thats what .
When the Sun Chief found the purse shortly afterwards , he muttered .
Yes , but I can , said Frog .
The Sun Chief then went to speak to his wife , Moon Lady .
This story comes from Angola .
I cant do that ! he confessed a moment later .
Oh , said Kimana quite taken ab@@ ack by Rab@@ b@@ its reaction .
So , early the next morning Frog put K@@ im@@ an@@ as letter in his mouth and hid in the well .
C@@ ant do what ? asked Frog .
Sh@@ all I lead you to your hus@@ b@@ and-@@ to-@@ be ? he asked .
Good day to you .
Her@@ es a purse full of money .
Each morning these young women would climb down from the sky on a l@@ add@@ er made by spider and fill up their water jugs before returning to heaven again .
Thats a difficult name to remember , he said .
Well , said Ananse with a sm@@ ile , when the dr@@ umm@@ ers beat the small drum it will make a sound like Fir@@ i bomo !
Af@@ ter@@ wards Ananse realised how fool@@ ish he had been .
Its called P@@ ona , said Night .
When Ananse got to N@@ ights village he said to Night , Your father wants to see you .
Then it seemed a thought struck him .
And you , Moon , he said turning to his second son , you have also forgotten the things I told you .
I have completed my task , master , said Ananse b@@ owing low to the Sky God .
Was Sun a wise choice , he wond@@ ered ?
How do I choose ? the Sky God muttered .
How will that help ? asked Sun , confused .
Its called As@@ ante , father , answered Moon .
Thank you , said Ananse , impressed .
This was because Sun was the Sky Gods favourite son , but just because he was his favourite did this also mean he should be chief ?
Ananse gave the matter a lot of thought and in the end decided to disgu@@ ise himself as a bird and do a bit of sp@@ ying before carrying out his masters instruction .
While they were growing up Night , Moon and Sun lived with their father , but when it came time for him to select one of them as chief he sent them to live in their own villages so that he could make his decision without too many distr@@ actions .
Now I must go and deliver the same message to your two brothers , said Ananse .
At this remark Sun pulled a face .
Who do I choose ?
Ananse reason@@ ed that there was only one way out of the predic@@ ament he had created for himself : in order to keep himself in the Sky Gods good books he needed to conv@@ in@@ ce his master that he actually could tell what he was thinking .
The capital of Ghana is Ac@@ cr@@ a .
Thats a good plan , he said .
A yam , by the way , looks rather like a pot@@ ato .
HOW SP@@ ID@@ ER RE@@ A@@ D THE S@@ K@@ Y@@ -G@@ O@@ DS TH@@ O@@ UG@@ HTS
Do you know what the question is ? asked Sun .
I know what youre thinking . Do you ? said the Sky God , but instead of carrying on the convers@@ ation as spider had expected him to do , he changed the subject .
At S@@ un@@ s village , Ananse said , Your father says you must come along with me . Then Ill set out straight away , but first let me get you something to eat .
For this reason , I have decided that only children will play during your re@@ ign .
Sun then went and slaughtered a sheep , which he ro@@ as@@ ted in honour of his small guest .
Yes , I do : he will ask you to name his favourite yam , which is called Kintinkyi .
Then turning back to his sons once more , Sun , if Moon tries to tr@@ es@@ pass upon your time K@@ ont@@ on@@ ku@@ row@@ ie , which is the circular rainbow , will throw itself around you and this will keep Moon away .
Now , throughout this ceremony the drums were be@@ ating . There were small drums and Inpintini drums and the sound they made was Kintinkyi bomo !
After the meal Ananse said , L@@ ets go and sit on that fallen tree over there , I have something to tell you .
The Sky God had three sons Night , Moon , and Sun .
When the locals saw this strange new bird they all became excited .
Then , edging closer , Ananse began to wh@@ is@@ per .
Your three sons are here as you ordered .
But this was easier said than done .
And when they were seated together , Your father has prepared a throne for the son he will name as chief and he wants you to be that person .
Night , he said , you are my eldest son . What is the name of this yam ?
Sun , you listened to my words and you did not forget them ;
However , he will also ask you and your two brothers the same question , and the one who answers the question correctly will be named as chief .
Night , he said , addressing himself to his eldest son , I also took you on walks , but you have allowed yourself to forget the things I told you , including the name of this yam .
you listened to my advice , so you are to be the chief .
But there is one question that I need each one of you to answer before I make my final decision .
Yes , I know it is , but I can help you with that .
Sun nod@@ ded .
The fact was he didnt know what the Sky God had been thinking and had merely spoken out in the hope of attr@@ acting his masters attention .
Oh , and one more thing , he said sm@@ iling down at spider , In the past my dec@@ rees were called The say@@ ings of the Sk@@ y-@@ God , but now , since Ananse , the spider , has been able to read my mind , they should be called The S@@ ay@@ ings of Spider .
During this period , he remained in his palace where he would sit deep in thought on his throne , a fire-@@ black@@ ened st@@ ool , trying to arrive at a ver@@ dic@@ t .
I know , he said , suddenly sm@@ iling to himself , I will pull up a yam known as Kintinkyi , which I used to show to my sons when they were young .
This was a difficult question for the Sky God to answer and one which he thought about all the time .
Thank you , said the Sky God , then raising his voice so everyone could hear , My sons , the reason I have brought you here is because I now wish to choose a chief .
It is called Kintinkyi .
Look , this is what Im going to do .
Ill make a small drum for you , and Ill also make an Inpintini drum to go with it .
The following story comes from Ghana , which is a west@@ -African country situated between Ivory Coast and T@@ ogo .
And if rain clou@@ ds gather , I shall sh@@ oot an arrow into the sky to drive them away .
Because of this , it is now law that only w@@ ic@@ ked things will be done during your time of day .
What kind of bird is that ? the Sky God asked those around him , but no one knew .
Tur@@ ning to his second son , the Sky God said , What do you think is the name of this yam , Moon ?
Ananse edged closer so that he could hear what he was saying .
He was just about to fly away again when he realised that the Sky God was still talking to himself .
Sun step@@ ped forward and took the yam from his fathers hand .
Now you@@ ve read the story , do you think this was a good way for the Sky God to choose a new chief ? And what about Sun was he fair to his two brothers ?
Some of those present looked confused and the rest just shrugged un@@ com@@ fort@@ ably , but no one spoke .
Ananse had over@@ heard all of this so now he really did know what the Sky God was thinking : he wanted to name his favourite son , Sun , as chief , but only if Sun could remember the name of the special yam he had been shown as a child .
You used to take me for walks when I was very small and you used to tell me its name , and I have not forgotten it .
At this reply those present shouted and applauded .
If Ananse were here , he would know the birds name , he said loudly . Then he sig@@ hed and said much more quietly to himself , He would also know that I want to make Sun chief , but I cant make up my mind if this is the right decision .
I remember this , he said .
I would have lik@@ ed my father to be here so that I could prepare a meal for him also , Sun confessed , and Im sorry that he is@@ nt , but youre here as his representative so I shall show you all the honour and respect I would have shown him .
How Spider Read the Sk@@ y-@@ Gods Th@@ oug@@ hts
And when they beat the l@@ n@@ pintini drum at the same time it will sound like this .
Kintinkyi bomo ! , which is the word you have to remember , right ? and spider made the sound of the drum with his mouth , Kintinkyi bomo !
What he needed was a plan .
He has asked me to bring you to him .
At Mo@@ ons village the same thing happened : Ananse delivered the Sky Gods message and Moon thanked him by giving him some m@@ ashed yam to eat .
Thank you for delivering the message , said Night .
A day later Sun , Moon and Night gathered in their fathers village .
Then at least let me give you something to eat for your journey , said Night and brought out some ro@@ as@@ ted corn which he gave to Ananse .
If one of them is able to remember its name then that son shall become chief .
Ananse , he said , please go and bring my three sons to me .
Some of them started shou@@ ting and pointing and everyone made such a comm@@ otion they soon attracted the attention of the Sky God himself .
A@@ h ! thought Ananse , so that was what my master was thinking !
Should any one have a matter to settle , let it be heard in S@@ un@@ s time .
Then the Sky God rose to his feet and everyone fell silent .
Then , just as the Sky God was about to turn away again , Ananse the spider said , I do , master .
Kintinkyi bomo ! just as spider said they would .
Then , happ@@ ily , he turned to his young@@ est son .
Thats why , one day , he suddenly looked around at his attend@@ ants and asked , Can anyone tell me what I am thinking ?
It grows under the ground too , but only in tropical countries .
At this point he held up a Kintinkyi yam that he had du@@ g up that morning .
He was also worried that his subjects would realise that he wasnt giving his full attention to the affairs of state .
So , he took some flower pet@@ als that resemb@@ led bird fe@@ ath@@ ers and stuck them onto his body . Then , with his bird cos@@ t@@ ume in place , he fle@@ w to the Sky Gods village , where he per@@ ched himself in the branches of a tree in the centre of the main squ@@ are .
In other words , in speaking out , he had du@@ g a very large hole for himself and now there was a very good chance he was about to fall in !
W@@ ill you do that ?
Then seeing the look of confusion on the others face , You know what this is , dont you ?
Yes .
Yes , my lord , it woke me up with its loud calls .
Then he led the sun inside his palace .
And so every morning when the cockerel crow@@ s the sun knows that it is time to wake up and hur@@ ry to the Sky Gods home in the sky .
Oh , and by the way , added the Sky God , come back to see me in the morning .
Yes , I will , my lord .
I have a present for you , he said , holding it out to the sun .
H@@ ere take it , the Sky God said , thr@@ us@@ ting the large white bird in the sun@@ s golden arms .
Then after you have visited my house you can slowly go back to your own .
You can go now .
Its my pleasure to be here , sir , said the sun very gr@@ ac@@ iously .
Well .@@ thank you , my lord , said the sun hesit@@ antly because he was still rather p@@ uzz@@ led .
I hope your journey wasnt too ti@@ ring because I know it was very difficult .
According to most scientists our universe began with a big ban@@ g about 10 billion years ago .
However , it took the sun a long time to ste@@ er a path through all the stars because they had not yet been given their positions in the sky , which meant that finding a way amongst them was quite difficult .
Yes , my lord , of course I will , he answered .
In fact I want you to do that every morning .
After the sun had de@@ parted for his place in the sky , the Sky God then called the moon to his house .
However , in this story from Angola a different explanation about how the world began is suggested .
And so the sun walked away carrying a large cockerel under his arm .
Yes , my lord , of course I do , its a cockerel .
I heard your cockerel c@@ row , said the Sky God .
How the World B@@ eg@@ an
Eventually , however , the sun arrived at the Sky Gods house .
Thank you for doing that .
This wasnt what the sun had expected , but the Sky God was his lord and master , so what choice did he have ?
Of course , the sun was very tired after his long journey across the heavens and he was also very hungry .
Good morning , my lord , the sun said respectfully , I am here as you asked .
Im pleased to hear that , said the Sky God then he reached behind him and pulled out a live cockerel .
In fact , he thought of eating the cockerel but then decided against the idea .
Early the next morning the sun was wok@@ en up by the loud cock@@ -@@ a-@@ d@@ oo@@ dl@@ e-@@ do of the cockerel and he hur@@ ried off to see the Sky God .
Good .
In the end , the sun was so exhausted he just lay down on the soft grass outside the Sky Gods house and was soon fast asleep .
HOW THE W@@ OR@@ L@@ D BE@@ G@@ AN
It was while this was happening that all the stars and plan@@ ets were formed .
Welcome to my house , he said sitting down on his throne .
After all , the bird had been to given him by the Sky God , so eating it just didnt seem like the right thing to do .
Yes , thank you for coming , replied the Sky God .
After he had thought about this problem for a long time he asked the sun to come and visit him .
From now on you must let the cockerel wake you up in the morning then you must come straight to my house here in the sky .
When the great Sky God decided to create the world he also had to decide where in the heavens to put the sun and moon .
Then I rushed here to see you as you asked .
A long , long time ago , millions of years before the Earth existed , the sky looked very different to what it does today .
I see you decided not to eat the cockerel that I gave you , even though you were tired and hungry , said the Sky God .
Of course not , my lord .
Good evening , moon , said the Sky God , then getting straight down to business , here is a cockerel for you .
Thank you , my lord , said the moon b@@ owing very deeply .
Thank you , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
The bird was a gift from you .
Please come and see me tomorrow morning .
The moon was rather surprised by the Sky Gods behaviour and even more surprised when she was given a live cockerel to hold .
Then , carrying the cockerel under her arm , she went off to find a place to sleep .
At this remark the Sky God looked very pleased .
But I will ask you to come to see me every twenty-@@ eight days and while youre away , Ill keep my eye on you in the sky .
Like the sun , the moon also had a long walk among the stars to reach the Sky Gods house .
I would never eat it .
Early the next morning the cockerel woke the moon with its loud crow@@ ing and the moon went to see the Sky God again .
Stil@@ l , she reason@@ ed , the Sky God had made the universe , so he must know what he was doing .
In fact , the journey took so long it was night time when moon finally knocked on the Sky Gods door .
And with these words the Sky God bid the moon good@@ b@@ ye and sent her back to her al@@ lot@@ ted place in the sky .
Since that time the sun and the moon have ob@@ eyed the Sky Gods wishes .
It was a long journey .
Well , here is a cockerel , said the Sky God .
After the Sky God had placed the sun and the moon in their positions in the sky he then turned his attention to another important matter : creating Man . For many , many years after man was created he lived quietly in Africas forests then one day he also decided to visit the Sky God in his palace .
Any@@ way , Man eventually arrived at the Sky Gods house and knocked on the front door .
Every morning , the sun wak@@ es up when the cockerel crow@@ s then immediately goes to visit the sky God at his house .
Oh , I am , my lord , replied Man , very tired .
A@@ h , Man . Y@@ ou@@ ve finally got here , said the Sky God .
And every twenty-@@ eight days , when the moon is full , she does the same thing .
In fact , he would never have got there without some mag@@ ical help from the Sky God himself , but thats another story .
You must be tired .
As you can imag@@ ine , it took Man a long time to get to the Sky Gods house .
He lit a fire , co@@ oked the bird over the open fl@@ ames then sat down to enjoy his sup@@ per .
Yes , Im afr@@ aid it is .
Please take it with you and come and see me again tomorrow morning .
But he was so worn out he only managed to eat half the bird before he fell into a deep sleep .
Thank you , my lord , said Man grat@@ efully accepting the bird .
Thats very kind of you , my lord .
The Man was tired and hungry just like the sun and the moon had been , but un@@ like them he decided to eat the cockerel .
You obviously slept through the cock c@@ row this morning .
That was when Man suddenly realised that he had done something wrong .
I was so hungry last night I killed and ate the cockerel you gave me .
Oh , I@@ d better r@@ ush off and see the Sky God , Man said , le@@ aping to his feet and rub@@ bing the sleep from his eyes .
Is it that late already , my lord ? asked Man .
Its a gift from me .
The Sky God met him at the door to his palace .
Good morning , or should I say good afternoon ? he j@@ oked .
After a long pause he said nerv@@ ously , I have something I must tell you , my lord .
In fact , he was so exhausted he slept for a long , long time and only woke up when the sun was already high in the sky .
No , you will die like the cockerel did .
I gave the sun and the moon a cockerel each , but they didnt eat their birds even though they were just as hungry as you .
By now the Man was so scared his mouth had gone dry .
Now leave me and go away , said the Sky God .
Why did you do that ?
Because you killed and ate the cockerel I gave you , you will not live forever in the sky like the sun and the moon .
And so it came to pass that all of the humans who were born after that first man , had to live out their lives on Earth and only visited the Sky God in his house after they died .
I didnt know I was doing anything wrong , my lord , he whisper@@ ed fear@@ fully .
With his mind still mixed up , the Man began his long journey back down to
The Sky God g@@ lar@@ ed at him .
The Man didnt know what to think because he wasnt sure if the Sky Gods ruling was a good or a bad thing for him .
You mean to your house in the sky , my lord ?
This explains why the moon and the sun journey across the sky in the way they do and why humans remain on Earth for their entire lives .
Because I was hungry , my lord .
There is a lesson contained in this story , too ;
every choice that you make will always affect your life in some way and often in a manner that you least expect at the time .
The Sky God shook his head .
But when you die - and only then - you will come here once more .
From now on the sun and moon will live in the sky forever and they will never die because they have their cocker@@ els to wake them up every morning , but things will be different for you , he said .

the National Council of Provinces , which has at least 90 delegates . 
The NCOP consists of nine provincial delegations nominated by the provincial legislatures , and the delegation of the South African Local Government Association . 
Most of this legislative work is done in committees , but all Bills must be referred to a sitting of the NCOP for debate and for a vote on whether to accept or reject the Bill . 
The NCOP considers , passes , am@@ ends , proposes amendments to , or re@@ jects legislation 
These officers manage the work of the NCOP and preside over debates , making sure that delegates can speak freely while remaining within the House rules . 
If necessary , the Premier can appoint someone to take her@@ /@@ his place . 
The Composition of the NCOP

Bills which do not affect provinc@@ es: 
It has a constitutional legislative role to deal with three kinds of Bill@@ s: 
If there is dis@@ agreement between the NA and the NCOP about a Bill affecting provinces , the Bill must be sent to the Mediation Committee . 
If the Bill to amend the constitution does not directly affect provinces , the constitution requires the NCOP to debate the Bill before it goes to the NA for voting . 
Over@@ sight is a constitu@@ tionally mandated function of Parliament to check and monitor government actions . 
Bills that directly affect provinc@@ es: 
When voting for these Bills in the NCOP , each province has one vote . 
Most of these Bills can be introduced in the NCOP by either House ; but there are some Bills that have to start in the National Assembly . 
If the NCOP wants to make changes to the Bill , it goes back to the National Assembly , which can accept or reject the changes . 
Bills that do not affect provinces are those which relate to national functions ; such as defence , foreign affairs , and justice . 
When a Bill to amend or change the constitution directly affects the provinces , at least six of the nine provinces in the NCOP must agree to it . 
Over@@ sight role 
Examples of Bills affecting provinces include education , transport , welfare , and health . 
When such Bills have been passed by the National Assembly , they go to the NCOP for voting . 
Bills that amend the Constitu@@ tion: 
By making a submission , you have an opportunity to influence the opinion of members of a committee who are discussing and deb@@ ating a particular piece of legislation before it is finalised . 
These are some of the ways that can be us@@ ed: 
Contact a Member of Parliament 
The right to petition Parliament is the right of every citizen of the country and is provided for in our Constitution . 
The NCOP exercises oversight over the national aspects of provincial and local government . 
Make a Submission 
Once a bill has been debated by a committee , it is submitted to the NCOP for a vote . 
A submission to a committee of Parliament is one way of making your voice heard in Parliament . 
The NCOP also conducts oversight visits to the communities in order to ensure that they get direct information on the needs and challenges of the people . 
The NCO@@ P@@ 's committees are called Select Committees , for example , the Select Committee on Housing , Public Works and Transport . 
The Committee also debates and am@@ ends Bills , and organises public hearings if an issue is of great public interest . 
A petition is a way of bringing a griev@@ ance or an issue of public concern to the attention of Parliament to take action within its authority . 
Pe@@ tition@@ : 
The NCOP delegates may ask Cabinet ministers questions which must be answered in the NCOP . 
Members of public can contact MP@@ s in constitu@@ ency offices throughout the country or at Parliament if you want to win their support for an issue you feel strongly about or if you need assistance with a particular problem . 
Each provincial delegation has one vote that is cast on behalf of the province by the head of its delegation . 
NCOP Committees 
Any person , groups of people or an organisation has the right to petition Parliament . 
The NCOP may require a Cabinet member , an official in the national government or a provincial government to attend a meeting of the Council or a committee of the Council . 
Each Committee shadows the work of specific government departments . 
The NCOP or any of its committees may receive petitions , representations or submissions from any interested persons or institutions . 
R@@ ole of the Members of the Public on Over@@ sight 
Committees may summon any person to give evidence or to produce documents , and they may require any person or institution to report to them .

Pe@@ ti@@ tions are classified into two categories , namely special petitions and public or general petitions . 
Clearly explain the issues or circumstances for Parliam@@ ent's consideration ; and 
Parliament has developed a number of mechanisms to promote public involvement in the law-@@ making process and broaden access to a people's Parliament . 
It is the inherent right of the members of the public in a democratic society to prepare and present petitions as and when the need ar@@ ises . 
However , there are certain procedures to be followed by individuals and/or groups in processing their petitions . 
One way the public can exercise this Constitutional right is through peti@@ tioning . 
Members of the public may contact a Member of Parliament to express a view on a piece of legislation . 
Despite women constituting the majority of the South African population , women are still in the minority when it comes to decision making . 
Women's representation in the National Assembly has increased to 45 .

The Bill of Rights guarantees equal treatment for all South Africans . 
Women should participate in lawmaking because the implementation of legislation and government policies has an impact on their daily lives . 
In order for women to fully participate in lawmaking , women's access to basic services should be improved . 
The South African Constitution provides a framework for the promotion of gender equality , and therefore the participation of women in lawmaking . 
WHAT ARE THE K@@ E@@ Y STR@@ UC@@ TU@@ RE@@ S FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPA@@ TE IN

Poverty is a struggle faced by many South African women , especially rural women . 
There are many challenges that prevent women from playing a full and meaningful role , and the biggest one is poverty .

WOMEN AND PARLIAMENT 
The Bill of Rights emphasises that measures must be taken to promote the achievement of equality in all spheres of society . 
More importantly , research has shown that when women take part in decision making , it leads to an increased focus and allocation of resources that improve the quality of life of all . 
Women can participate in lawmaking by voting for the political party they think can best represent their views and concerns in Parliament . 
1 An increase in the participation of women in lawmaking can by extension lead to an improvement in access to basic services such as housing , education and welfare . 
Women constitute more than half of the South African population and therefore the vo@@ ices of women must be included when decisions are taken and laws are made . 
Access to basic services such as education , water and welfare has been influenced by unequal gender , race and class relations . 
How people vote in the elections determines the composition of both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces . 
Produc@@ ed by Parliamentary Communication Services 
The challenge is to make the rights accessible to all women . 
The South African Constitution says that there must be public access to and involvement in Parliament and its processes . 
Further Re@@ ad@@ ing: 
More and more men are taking a stand against violence against women and children . 
The first and most important way women can be involved in Parliament is during elections . 
The inclusion of women in decision making is a fundamental human right . 
The majority of women lack economic empowerment .

In particular , a year is allowed from the time the Bill is signed and promulgated before the provisions establishing the new Commission will take effect .
FINAN@@ CIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ST@@ ATE
The State Law Advis@@ ers and the Department of Trade and Industry are of the opinion that the Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure prescribed by section 76 or of the Constitution since it falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 to the Constitution , namely consumer protection .
O@@ TH@@ ER DE@@ PAR@@ TM@@ ENTS AND BO@@ DI@@ ES CONS@@ UL@@ TED
It is proposed that it be converted into a statutory body . The agency will require a staff complement of 94 people , 31 of whom will be transferred from the Consumer and Corporate Regulation Division . Therefore 63 positions will have to be filled in future .
Recogn@@ ising the extensive scope of this Bill on the consumer economy , and the difficulty of accurately predic@@ ting all of the particular administrative changes needed to accommodate it , the transition rules create f@@ l ex@@ ibility by permitting the Minister to defer , for up to a further six months , the effect of any specific provision , if more time proves to be required to prepare for the efficient and effective implementation of the provision .
The Bill requires the Commission to promote and support the development of a fair , transparent , sustainable , responsible , efficient , effective and accessible consumer market and industry , particularly to serve the needs of historically disadvantaged persons , low-income persons and communities , and remote , isolated or low-@@ d@@ ensity areas and communities ;
A further six months is provided for before the remaining provisions will take effect and the old laws will be repealed .

The Tribunal established under the National Credit Act , 2005 , will conduct hearings on complaints under the Act and adjud@@ icate certain disputes and alleged prohibited conduct under the Act .
The Commission is not a completely new institution , as it will entail the expansion of the mandate of the Office of Consumer Protection , which is currently being inc@@ ub@@ ated within the dti .
The Bill was published in the Gazette for public comment , and further consultations were held with other government departments , sector regulators , industry associations , consumer groups , professional associations , trade unions and other interested persons .
Given the fact that the national and provincial governments have concurrent legislative competence in respect of consumer protection , initial consultation was conducted with provinces to ensure that there was broad agreement on the Bill and that potential constitutional concerns have been dealt with .

S@@ UM@@ M@@ ARY OF BILL
The Bill encourages disp@@ ut@@ ants to seek resolution of their disputes through mediation , conciliation and arbitration in their provincial consumer courts , omb@@ ud@@ s or other such agencies .
It is an offence to fail to comply with a compliance order .
I@@ tem 2 of the second Schedule , which deals with transitional arrangements , provides a schedule to manage the coming into operation of the Act , so as to afford reasonable time for both suppliers and the regulators to ad@@ just their practices and systems to accommodate the new requirements of the Act .
refer matters relating to alleged offences in terms of the Act to the National Prosecuting Authority .
The State Law Advis@@ ers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18 of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act , 2003 , since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional communities .
Criminal sanc@@ -@@ tions relate to offences and administrative sanctions relate to prohibited conduct .

refer matters relating to alleged prohibited conduct in terms of the Act to the Tribunal .
Finally , recognising that some municipalities may face resource and capacity impediments that could inhibit their ability to address their new obligations as suppliers of goods or services to consumers , the transitional provisions grant the Minister authority , on request by the Minister for Provincial and Local Government , to further defer the application of specific provisions of the Bill to those municipalities as may prove necessary .
The Bill proposes the establishment of the Commission , which , together with the Tribunal , will provide for the effective administration of the Act .
The provincial consumer protection authorities may also request the Commission to initiate a complaint in respect of any apparent prohibited conduct or offence in terms of the Act .
The Bill makes provision for criminal and administrative sanctions .
Department of Social Development
RE@@ G@@ UL@@ AT@@ OR@@ Y INS@@ TITU@@ TIONS
The Bill gives the Commission power to issue a compliance notice to a person or association of persons whom the Commission on reasonable grounds believes has engaged in prohibited conduct .
conduct research and make proposals for reform to improve access to the consumer market or generally to achieve the objectives of the Act ;
The following departments were consulted on the Bill :
Department of Transport
Department of Housing
The Commission will be established as an organ of state responsible to the Minister .
All provincial departments of finance and economic affairs
Given the arr@@ ay of authorities within the national , provincial and municipal spheres of government who have the power to expropriate property , there is a need to ensure uniformity in the way organs of state undertake expropriation .
In the subsequent drafting of the Bill , the Department specifically li@@ aised with the Department of Land Affairs and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development .
? ? the market value of the property ;
and ? ? the purpose of the expropriation ;
In November 2007 , the Department of Public Works published a Draft Policy on the Expropriation Bill for public comment and in February 2008 , the Department hosted workshops on the policy with organs of state and the private sector , respectively .
The State Law Advis@@ ers and the Department of Public Works are of the opinion that this Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure established by section of the Constitution since it contains no provision to which the procedure set out in section 74 or 76 of the Constitution applies .
all affected parties to be notified of a contemplated expropriation , to afford such parties an opportunity to raise objections and make representations to the expropriating authority , before a decision to expropriate is taken .
The Bill seeks to align the Act with the Constitution and to provide a common framework to guide the processes and procedures for expropriation of property by organs of state , by providing for the extension of the purposes for which property may be expropriated from the narrow term of public purpose to include expropriations in the public interest .
? ? the extent of direct state investment and subsidy in the acquisition and beneficial capital improvement of the property ;
Whilst the market value of expropriated property is a predomin@@ ant factor in the Act , the Constitution does not give undue weight to any single factor over others , but requires consideration of all relevant factors , including ? ? the current use of the property ;
the staff@@ ing of the Secretariat to the Boards by officials from the Department of Public@@ Works , who shall be responsible for the provision of support functions ;
MEM@@ OR@@ AN@@ DU@@ M ON THE OB@@ J@@ EC@@ TS OF THE EX@@ PRO@@ PR@@ I@@ ATION BILL , 2008
? ? the history of the acquisition and use of the property ;
The re@@ drafting of the Act therefore became necessary to ensure consistency with the spirit and provisions of the Constitution dealing especially with equality , property rights , access to information , and lawful , reasonable and procedurally fair administrative decision-making .
The implementation of the Bill will have financial implications for the Department of Public Works , in that it will be responsible for the establishment of the Expropriation Advisory Boards and their secret@@ ari@@ ats , as well as a register of expropriations .

So with his new plan all worked out , mantis took his djani up into the t@@ all@@ est ba@@ obab and waited quietly amongst the branches .
On the day that the mantis decided to put his plan into action he hid himself in a bush until the sky began to dar@@ ken .
He must be a go@@ d so we must bow down and praise him .
THE MAN@@ TI@@ S AND THE M@@ O@@ ON
And while it was trying to free itself the mantis would scr@@ amble up the stake and climb onto the moon , which he would then ride vic@@ tor@@ iously across the sky .
Now I@@ ve caught you !
In the days that followed this first attempt , the mantis went back to observ@@ ing the moon .
Ill have one more try , he said , then closed his eyes for a moment , preparing for an even greater le@@ ap .
Ang@@ r@@ ily picking up a stone he hur@@ led it into the pool .
No , not that .
Plan Number Three was to cut a stake , sharp@@ en it at one end and set it into the ground on a h@@ ill@@ top .
Im coming to get you , moon , said the mantis , and with a wh@@ ir@@ ring of wings , he left the cam@@ el thorn tree and fle@@ w to the foot of the ba@@ obab tree .
That night he hid in a bush from where he watched the moon move slowly towards the stake .
A div@@ iner was a hol@@ y person who could for@@ et@@ ell the future .
The word mantis comes from ancient Greek and means div@@ iner .
What would happen , he wond@@ ered , if one night the moon van@@ ished and never rose again ?
But then a surprise awaited him : when he reached the top of the tree the moon seemed as far away as ever .
When the rising moon was directly above his hiding place he fl@@ ung the djani into the sky with all his might .
He got to the base of the cam@@ el thorn tree then began to climb up the trunk as fast as he could .
And , of course , they are also remembering the small short-@@ w@@ ing@@ ed one who w@@ ished to be a go@@ d .
That was when evenings shadows began to cre@@ ep out from under the stones where they had been hiding during the hot@@ test part of the day .
The San regarded the mantis as a special cre@@ ature with mag@@ ical powers .
that he didnt want to ride upon the moon either .
All that happened was that the stake cast a long , thin shadow on the ground while the moon moved across the sky , high above .
That plan didnt work quite as well as I thought it would , said the mantis , looking rather upset .
There were even nights when there was no moon at all .
That was when he realised how fool@@ ish he had been ;
First he wo@@ ve a ro@@ pe out of dry grass then he made a noose out of the ro@@ pe which he tied to the end of a long stick .
As the moon rose into the sky it would pi@@ erce itself on the stick and get stuck there .
V@@ ery carefully the mantis cre@@ pt for@@ wards until he was looking down at the moons b@@ right disc flo@@ ating below him in the pool .
Oh , you fool@@ ish moon ! the mantis sm@@ iled .
The mantis had noticed that the moon went through different phases as it rose into the sky , so he reason@@ ed the best thing that he could do was to capture it early on , when it first pe@@ ered over the horiz@@ on .
H@@ ed stopped because the moon was there too , and it was caught in the water .
Even the high@@ fl@@ ying night birds couldnt reach it , so how could a small aw@@ kw@@ ard cre@@ ature with short , wh@@ ir@@ ring wings hope to get there ?
The djani consists of a length of re@@ ed , a par@@ tr@@ idge fe@@ ather and a stone all tied together with a short tw@@ ist of sinew .
But by the time he finally reached the top of the tree the moon had moved on again .
First he noticed the shadows of the thorn trees on the sand , then he saw the birds dar@@ ting clear and swift across the sky .
Thank you , moon , he said sincerely , b@@ owing deeply to the sky .
He managed to get back to the bank where he stood sh@@ iv@@ ering , wet and confused .
Once upon a time there was a mantis whose greatest wish was to sit on the moon as it s@@ ailed cross the sky each night .
Why had he stopped , you may ask ?
My eyes ! he scre@@ amed .
He noticed that it kept changing , for example . Then it got bigger again . It rose later each night and it got smaller and smaller every time he saw it .
I need to out@@ w@@ it the moon , he kept telling himself , which is why he came up with Plan Number Four .
How would all the night cre@@ atures in the desert survive without the moons g@@ low to help them find food ?
Of@@ ten the mantis would dream about how proud he would feel gaz@@ ing down onto the great dry Kalahari Desert where he lived , how his heart would s@@ well as he star@@ ed out across the empty water@@ courses and the herds of spr@@ ing@@ bo@@ k grazing amongst the cam@@ el thorn trees .
Then the moon began to rise .
That was how he came to be standing next to a water@@ hole in the desert an hour later .
Later on , when it rose higher into the sky it moved faster and faster and often , just as dawn was arriving , it would swiftly v@@ anish into the heavens even before it reached the horiz@@ on .
N@@ evertheless , with his arms out@@ stretched he le@@ ap@@ t up into the air only to fall back into the branches , where he sat disappointed watching the moon flo@@ at away across the sky and f@@ ade into the dawn .
The events you are going to read about happened a long time ago when great herds of el@@ eph@@ ant and g@@ em@@ s@@ bo@@ k ro@@ amed across the vast , dry plains of He@@ iku@@ m , which is the name the San people gave to the Kalahari Desert .
What I need now is a new approach , which is when he came up with the idea of trying to tr@@ ap the moon .
Because he was thir@@ st@@ y and needed a drink ?
Sur@@ ely , thought the mantis , if I throw the djani into the air it will tw@@ ist itself around the moon and then the weight of the stone will bring the planet cr@@ ash@@ ing down to Earth ?
It fle@@ w out of his hands like a wh@@ ip .
Except that things didnt quite work out as he expected because when he threw his noose into the air , it simply fell back empty .
All he wanted was to get his sight back and for the pain to go away .
It was only the next morning that the pain went away and the man@@ t@@ iss ey@@ esight returned .
When a djani is tos@@ sed into the air it spir@@ als back to the ground like a sy@@ cam@@ ore leaf .
U@@ p and up and up it went , then down and down and down it fell , back into the branches , the fe@@ ather fl@@ ut@@ tering amongst the leaves like a small , injured bird .
All that night the mantis stood pr@@ aying , s@@ way@@ ing g@@ ently , beg@@ ging the moon to give him back his sight .
That is why now@@ ad@@ ays all man@@ t@@ ises sit with their for@@ eleg@@ s held up before their faces : they are pr@@ a@@ ising the moon that for@@ gave their anc@@ est@@ or and restored his sight .
Ill not give up now , the mantis said and began to climb .
Oh , Im so cl@@ ever .
It was now cr@@ adl@@ ed in the branches of a nearby ba@@ obab tree .
But when he looked again , the moon seemed even further away .
Bl@@ ind@@ ed , he stagg@@ ered away from the water@@ hole and cr@@ ashed into some bushes where he tried to ru@@ b the spl@@ inters from his eyes , but nothing would ease the pain .
Of course , that didnt work either which is when his temper got the better of him again .
When the moon was above him he would run out of his hiding place , throw the noose around the moon and then haul himself up .
What could be easier than that ?
Com@@ e back , shouted the mantis , sh@@ aking a f@@ ist in the air , but his words just echo@@ ed in the darkness .
This plan involved the use of a djani , which is a to@@ y that bush@@ man give to their children .
When the mantis could see that the moon was caught in the branches of a nearby cam@@ el thorn tree , he cre@@ pt out of his hiding place and dar@@ ted across the ground .
This was when the moon was most vulnerable , when it was big and c@@ umb@@ er@@ some and s@@ low-@@ moving .
T@@ ime and time again , the mantis hid in the branches of t@@ all trees watching the moon as it s@@ ailed across the sky and time and time again he tried to catch it , but without success .
The next day the mantis put his third plan into action .
But the mantis was just an insec@@ t and the moon was far away .
He wanted to do this so that he could look down on all the other animals in the desert .
This time my plan is fool@@ proof , said the mantis , looking extremely pleased with himself .
And in the end he came up with an answer .
Immediately the moons refl@@ ection was sh@@ at@@ tered into a thousand d@@ agg@@ er-@@ sharp spl@@ inters .
His plan was that he would hide amongst some rocks on a h@@ ill@@ top nearby .
Then he began ch@@ asing after the moon .
But , of course , he had spoken too soon .
When he looked up he realised the tree was even t@@ all@@ er than he expected , so high in fact that its branches seemed to be stretched out amongst the stars .
My plan is@@ nt working , said the mantis after his twentieth failed attempt .
This was when the mantis was the most un@@ easy .
The Man@@ tis and the Moon
No longer ar@@ rog@@ ant and proud , now he was just a small and humble insec@@ t .
I can still reach it , he said and threw himself up into the air , only to fall back into the branches .
This is the story about how the mantis became known as the pr@@ aying mantis .
He imag@@ ined them looking up at him and saying , Look , there is the mantis travelling on the moon .
This story comes from the San people who live in the Kalahari Desert .
And by the time hed picked it up for another throw , the moon had moved on again .
For a long time the mantis thought about this problem as he sat roc@@ king back and forth on a tw@@ ig , or res@@ ting cup@@ ped inside a leaf .
Maybe I need to come up with another idea ?
First he found the stick he needed then he sharp@@ ened it at one end before he planted it firmly in the ground .
I@@ ve got you now , he said , then , taking a deep bre@@ ath , he le@@ ap@@ t out into the water , only to sin@@ k g@@ as@@ ping and spl@@ ut@@ tering ben@@ e@@ ath the surface .
Maybe that wasnt such a good idea , he said to himself , reaching for a tw@@ ig which he then used to try and pro@@ d and pr@@ y the moon out of the water .
In a fit of temper , the mantis r@@ ipped the stone from the djani and threw it on the ground .
Having failed three times most people would give up , but not the mantis who was a very determined fellow .
that he didnt want to be a go@@ d any longer ;
At dawn it appears in the east and at d@@ us@@ k in the west .
Before long the old man learnt that the boys name was Kileken and that he was an orph@@ an .
That night the old man stayed aw@@ ake , thinking about what to do .
When Kileken was a long way from the house he stopped and began looking around . He seemed to be checking that no one was watching him .
Kileken where are you ? he called out , but no one answered , so he went to the window and looked out .
I@@ ve never seen my cows look so healthy .@@ And all the ch@@ ores around the house are done , too .@@ Its just .@@ Its just amazing .
In fact , I@@ d enjoy your company .
B@@ esides , not only was the boy a great help he was also good company too .
I dont expect you to do all my jobs , said the old man , but the boy just laug@@ hed .
Thats too much .
By day@@ break the next morning the boy had done all the things that he had promised .
For this reason , he spent most of his evenings gaz@@ ing up at the stars , many of which he knew so well he thought of them as his children .
He didnt see the old man hiding behind a bush .
For a while things continued as before and both the old man and the boy enjoyed each others company and a life full of good things .
This story comes from the Mas@@ aai , a nom@@ adic people who live in Kenya .
By the time the sun rose he had a plan all worked out .
S@@ adly , the old man walked slowly home across the cr@@ acked and broken earth .
Ac@@ tually , the old man was p@@ uzz@@ led , though he didnt say so .
I dont know .
But were friends .
There was one star in particular that the old man lik@@ ed more than all the others , but one night when he was out in the bush he looked up into the sky only to see that his favourite star had gone .
That evening when he looked up at the night sky he saw the b@@ right star again that had gone missing on the night he had first met Kileken .
All he could think about was his young friends secret powers ?
It is about the planet Venus , which the Ma@@ as@@ ai call Kileken .
No .
Yes , even you .
That was when he knew that his young friend , Kileken the orph@@ an boy , had gone back to the heavens .
It became fresh and green and full of life with f@@ ountains of water and wo@@ oded gro@@ ves .
All that work you@@ ve described will take you two days at least .
Please trust me on this .
A moment later the boy turned into a bl@@ az@@ ing star and sp@@ ed upwards into the sky .
A@@ str@@ onom@@ ers now call that star Venus .
Yes , you are , and thank you , said the old man , but that still do@@ es@@ nt mean to say you have to do all my work .
So where are you going to sleep tonight ? asked the old man .
In his surprise , the old man let out a cr@@ y of shock .
All the beautiful trees and bushes that had spr@@ ung up so suddenly now with@@ ered and died .
Cr@@ ying out as if in pain he threw himself to the ground , hiding his head ben@@ e@@ ath his hands and mo@@ an@@ ing with despair .
What special powers ?
I have lots of energy in the morning .
But as time passed , so the old mans cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity began to grow until he became so ob@@ s@@ essed he couldnt sleep at night .
In@@ st@@ antly a b@@ right light began to fill his body .
The next morning , the boy described the jobs he was going to do that day .
He had indeed found out the boys secret but at what cost ?
At first the old man thought his young friend was j@@ oking , then he realised that he was quite serious .
The Ma@@ as@@ ai call it Kileken the orph@@ an who works long and hard all day .
Oh , dont wor@@ ry , he said .
When it was going dark , the boy returned to the old mans house .
Just leave it to me , he said myster@@ iously .
Thats why I can do so much .
He looked up from his bed to see that his young guest had made breakfast and ti@@ died up the house .
Once upon a time there was a very old man who lived alone in a hut .
That was when the old man realised that through his actions the boys magic powers had been taken away .
What could they be ? he kept asking himself , And why w@@ ont he tell me about them ?
It started at the tips of his out@@ stretched fingers and spread rapidly down to his feet .
H@@ ell@@ o ?
Immediately , the boy turned around and saw where he was hiding .
Even as the old man looked on , the landscape changed from lus@@ h , fertile and green to dry , bar@@ ren and brown .
And Im younger than you , too .
No friends or relatives came to visit him and he only had his shadow for company .
The boy shrugged .
But Kileken just sm@@ iled .
I have special powers , said the boy .
When the old man woke up the next morning , he had a very pleasant surprise .
Now he was lon@@ el@@ ier than he had ever been .
No , you cant do all that in one day , said the old man , quite shocked .
In the distance he could see the boy out in the fields , t@@ ending the cattle .
The Mor@@ ning St@@ ar
You should know that Venus sh@@ ines brightly in the morning and in the evening .
S@@ atis@@ f@@ ied that he was un@@ observed , the boy climbed onto a rock and lifted up his arms .
Your secret will be safe with me .
Its a secret .
On the way back to his house he met a boy who was also out walking and the two of them struck up a convers@@ ation .
Thank you , thats very kind , said the boy and took him up on his offer .
Then when the boy left the hut he followed him at a distance , making sure to keep out of sight .
He searched the heavens for his child for a long time without success then , with a heavy heart , he finally headed back home .
And trust him he did , for a time at least .
I get them from my anc@@ est@@ ors .
Then suddenly all the surrounding land began to change .
But I offered you shelter .@@ I invited you into my house !
Special powers ? he repeated un@@ certainly .
In some parts of the world Venus is called the morning star , and in others it is called the evening star .
The old man thought about this .
Eventually , these questions began to g@@ na@@ w at him like a great hunger until in the end he decided that he had to find some answers .
Y@@ our@@ e welcome to stay with me , he said .
Then the land began to change again , even before the old man could answer .
I beg@@ ged you not to do this , he said s@@ adly .
How do you manage all this ? the old man asked .
THE M@@ OR@@ N@@ ING ST@@ AR
In fact , not only that but when he brought in the cattle they were fat@@ ter and ro@@ under than the old man had ever seen them before .
Then he rememb@@ ered how lon@@ ely he had been before the boy came to stay with him so he decided not to ask too many questions in case he off@@ ended his young guest .
Yes , I know , and for that Im very grateful , but if I tell anyone my secret .
When Kileken got up and began to prepare for the day ahead the old man pret@@ ended to be asleep .
Im sorry , I cant tell you .
If I tell anyone my secret your good fortune will end .
A moment later , all the colour dr@@ ained from his face and his eyes filled up with tears .
What he couldnt understand was how one small boy could manage to do so much ?
Yes , said the humans .
Are you quite clear about the message ?
Im sorry , my lord , but I just said what I was told to say , answered the hare , sh@@ iv@@ ering with fear .
Not long afterwards the hare went to see the moon to inform him that the message had been delivered .
Why ar@@ ent we re-@@ born time and time again ?
Every month the moon is born as a sli@@ m c@@ rescent , grows to ful@@ l@@ ness then d@@ ies away , only to be re@@ born a few days later .
Yes , I told the humans that you die every month and that from now on they@@ re going to die , too , probably outside on the grass .
The Or@@ ig@@ in of Death
Except that it was a long walk to where the humans lived , and somewhere along the way the hare got confused and j@@ umb@@ led things up .
Not my problem , he said with a sh@@ rug and bound@@ ed off towards the forest .
I have passed on your message , my lord .
This story comes from the Kho@@ isan , a mainly nom@@ adic people who lived in southern Africa .
The fun in this game comes from the fact that there is always a difference between the original message and the one which finally emer@@ ges at the end of the chain .
First the hare c@@ oug@@ hed to clear his th@@ ro@@ at then he said very loudly , Every month I am born , then I die sitting on the law@@ n .
From now on this will happen to you .
The one you gave to the ant .
What do you think ?
Once upon a time the moon decided to send a message to humans down on Earth informing them that they would become im@@ mortal and live forever .
The message that eventually arrived at head@@ quarters was : Bring three or four p@@ ence , were going to a dance !
Sorry this is@@ nt good enough , shouted the moon and with these words he picked up a piece of wood lying nearby and struck the hare on the n@@ ose , spl@@ itting it in two .
The one I gave to the ant , but that you delivered on his behalf ?
And what message was that ?
Of@@ f you go then , said the moon .
Now , it suddenly occurred to What exactly is your message ? he asked .
Have you ever played the game called Chinese Wh@@ ispers , where a whisper@@ ed message is passed from player to player ?
At this remark the moon nar@@ rowed his eyes suspici@@ ously .
Yes , my lord , answered the ant , b@@ owing very low .
But thats the message the ant gave me . ,
The answer , at least according to the San , is because a simple message went astr@@ ay and wasnt delivered correctly .
The ant set off , but while on his journey he was over@@ taken by the hare , who being rather nos@@ y said , Where are you going , ant ?
Before long he was saying , Every month I am born , I die then I greet the dawn .
I have decided that from now on this will also happen to them too .
For example , there is the story of a general who , finding himself under attack one day sent a run@@ ner back to head@@ quarters with the instruction : Bring reinforc@@ ements , were going to advance !
This cycle of birth , growth and death has been happening for millions of years and continues to happen to this day .
Tel@@ l the humans that every month I am born , I grow , I die and then I get re@@ born .
Yes , I have a message that I have to deliver to all humans .
Eventually , the hare reached the humans , p@@ uff@@ ing out his chest , he said , I have been sent by the moon to deliver an important message to you .
Se@@ eing the ang@@ ry look on the moons face , the hare suddenly became so scared he couldnt remember exactly what hed said .
So why are humans not im@@ mortal like the moon ?
However , since the moon wasnt able to visit the Earth himself , he decided to use an ant to carry the message on his behalf .
Yes , my lord , said the ant .
THE OR@@ IG@@ IN OF DE@@ AT@@ H
That someone else did lik@@ ew@@ ise and so on .
We dont understand your message , one of them said .
The ant , who was already tired and knew what a long journey lay ahead of him , was only too pleased to accept this offer .
Thats why people die at the end of their lives and never get re@@ born as the moon intended them to and all thanks to the hare , some people would say .
Maybe you should play Chinese Wh@@ ispers with your friends and see what happens to a message that you send ?
The run@@ ner , unable to make the whole journey himself , passed the message to someone else .
Oh , Im sorry , said the moon , m@@ imic@@ king the hare , though anyone looking on could see quite clearly that he wasnt .
The hare didnt understand the message either , but he was just the mess@@ eng@@ er , so why should that matter .
Yes , my lord , quite clear .
And you remember the message word for word , do you ?
Oh , you can remember the meaning , can you ?
A nom@@ ad is a person who do@@ es@@ nt have a permanent home , but who moves from place to place .
And so the hare set off , bo@@ unding across the land , all the time repeating the same message to himself as he went .
Look , remarked the hare , youre rather slow and aw@@ kw@@ ard , ar@@ ent you ? - The ant just shrugged - So why dont you let me take the message for you ?
Im doing on an err@@ and for the moon , answered the ant .
Every month I am born , I grow , I die and then I eat corn .
That way it will get delivered a lot quicker .
Then they held their bre@@ ath , waiting for him to speak .
How dare you tell humans I said something that I didnt !
The humans looked at him .
Now since that day the har@@ es n@@ ose has been split and all humans still believe what hare once told their anc@@ est@@ ors .
From now on this will happen to you too , answered the ant who had failed to inform the moon that he was suffering from a small hearing problem .
But thats not the message I gave the ant ! ro@@ ar@@ ed the moon .
Re@@ ally ? he said .
But perhaps were being too har@@ s@@ h on the hare ?
Yes , the hare said proudly .
An err@@ and ?
Oh , thats very interesting , said the hare .
I forget the exact words I used , my lord , he said nerv@@ ously . But I can remember the meaning .
O@@ K , he said , without a moments pause .
In the following story , the same thing happens , a message is sent but gets changed over time with disastrous consequences for all concerned , you and I included .
I have a message that I want you to give to all humans , the moon said .
The San now live in or near the Kalahari Desert , which is a large dry wild@@ erness area covering parts of Namibia , Botswana and north-@@ west South Africa .
Naisa stopped next to him and dropped her school sat@@ ch@@ el on the ground .
It was interesting .
Aice sat himself on the ground next to his sister and picked up a stone ar@@ ro@@ wh@@ ead that was lying amongst the old mans things then dropped it as suddenly again when the old man sm@@ acked him on the hand .
Im making an arrow , he said finally .
Aice , of course , was referring to the fact that it was a cl@@ ever idea , not the temperature .
No , I dont think so !
Yes , I have .
H@@ ey , you cant stop there , Aice said .
Its a complete mystery to me , added Aice , throwing his hands out to emphasise the point .
L@@ ong , long before that , the old man muttered .
Does it matter ? asked the old man .
The olden days .
Everyone knew that Aice h@@ ated school as much as she loved it .
What are you doing , sir ?
What about you , Aice ?
Then one day the sun-man was thrown into the sky , he became round and turned into the sun .
Naisa squ@@ at@@ ted down b@@ eside him .
What do you mean by that , sir ? she asked polit@@ ely , By the olden days I mean ?
I prefer the cold weather , Naisa said ignor@@ ing the incident .
In the beginning , this sun-man only gave off light and heat around his own hut .
Aice , who was about to make a rather r@@ ude suggestion changed his mind when he saw the look that Naisa was giving him .
Are you saying that the climate was different in the past ? she asked finally .
The old man , who had long , str@@ agg@@ ly grey hair and was wearing a pair of blue je@@ ans and an old t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t fr@@ ayed around the neck , was so intent on what he was doing , he didnt notice the two of them approach until they were almost standing over him .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
They@@ d had this convers@@ ation a hundred times before and now it had almost become a kind of running jo@@ ke between them .
Our teacher says that all the stars and plan@@ ets came about after a big ban@@ g , he said , but the old man simply ignored him .
You say the sun was thrown up into the sky , right ?
Ill sit over here .
Aice couldnt help sm@@ iling at this remark .
Eventually , the old man put down the arrow again , wip@@ ed his fingers on his tro@@ users then looked at them both .
The climate changed when the San were the only people on Earth , answered the old man , putting down the arrow and then picking up a length of tw@@ ine .
Yes , she said picking up her bag and heading off down the road .
Naisa looked at her brother , but his attention had dr@@ if@@ ted away again .
Aice threw his sister a look of dis@@ belief .
F@@ un ? he repeated , like the word was new to him .
It was only after his young audience was properly seated , when Naisa had stopped giving her brother nas@@ ty looks and when he had their full attention that he became serious again .
Its very hot today , she complain@@ ed .
After a long pause he said , Well , thats the interesting part .
No , we dont , sir , she said .
B@@ ene@@ ath a clou@@ dless sky the land was b@@ aking .
Naisa bent down and br@@ ushed some of the dust from her sand@@ als with her finger@@ tips .
Its hot today , Aice said , stopping to remove his bas@@ eb@@ all ca@@ p then using it to wip@@ e the swe@@ at from his fore@@ head .
He had gone back to f@@ id@@ dling with the arrow sh@@ aft , holding it up to his eye , checking it for stra@@ ight@@ ness .
Not if it was cold like in the olden days you wouldnt , the old man remarked .
Thats news to me , sir , she said .
Aice , who was twelve , and a year older than his sister , shook his head .
Oh , absolutely , sir , Aice answered , though he didnt sound convinc@@ ing .
That was when he heard her Aice say the d@@ read@@ ed words .
He had dark brown hair that had the hab@@ it of flo@@ p@@ ping down across one eye .
The Sun and the Children is a San story .
You mean before we were born ? .
G@@ ive me the winter instead of the summer any day .
Did you know that according to legend our people were the first to live on the Earth ? he asked .
What does that mean : When the San were the only people on Earth ? he asked his sister .
The sun-man would go to sleep on the ground and sometimes , when hed roll over or lift up his arms when he was dre@@ aming , the sun would sh@@ ine .
The sun and the moon , the old man continued , were originally men who lived on Earth .
The rice they had grown was ready for harvesting but the plants were very wet and needed drying out .
Apparently having finished his story , the old man picked up his arrow again and began sharp@@ ening one end against a stone .
Then he gr@@ inned at his sister .
Our people had a problem , he began .
Why dont you sit on that stone over there , Naisa , he said giving her a hard sh@@ ove in the back and almost sending her spraw@@ ling .
Would you like to hear it ? .
Naisa gl@@ anced across at her brother then decided to answer for them both .
Naisa shook her head .
Then tell us how they did it , demanded Aice .
Aice , who had only been half list@@ ening to the convers@@ ation , now looked confused .
You see , it was children . It was children just like you who put the sun in the sky .
At first the old man looked ready to argue the point then he seemed to think better of the idea .
They came across the old man sitting at the side of the road in the sh@@ ade of a ba@@ obab tree ten minutes later .
But its just an old , b@@ oring old legend , said the man , who seemed to have lost his interest in the whole aff@@ air .
What is more interesting is that it was the children of these first people who threw the sun up into the sky .
Naisa , who considered herself something of a geograph@@ er , thought about this for a moment .
A story ?
The trouble was , the sun-man spent most of his time asleep on the ground so it was always cold and dark .
The sun sh@@ one from the mans arm@@ pits , the old man said .
Ye@@ ars and years ago ? .
I dont think interesting is a good word to describe school , he called out . I prefer b@@ oring or d@@ ull .
We didnt cre@@ ep up on you .
You havent finished your story .
So you mean everywhere else was cold and dark ? said Naisa .
Then maybe I should tell you the story .
No , we dont , sir , she replied g@@ lar@@ ing men@@ ac@@ ingly at her brother .
Yes , of course it matters !
She was sli@@ m and pret@@ ty and her eyes nar@@ rowed as she fixed them on a line of dist@@ ant h@@ ills , sh@@ imm@@ ering in the heat h@@ aze .
So you dont know about the time when we were the only people of Earth ? the old man asked .
Its wrong to p@@ ick up things that dont belong to you , he said .
P@@ ushing it back with his for@@ ear@@ m , he replaced his h@@ at and set off after her .
Aice said , causing the old man to j@@ erk with a shock and to drop the piece of wood he was working on .
And you havent told us who did the throwing either , added Naisa .
Now he was star@@ ing up into the branches high above them .
The dry and d@@ us@@ ty road that Aice and his sister N@@ i@@ asa were walking along cut through a mix of par@@ ched s@@ cru@@ b land , sand dunes and sh@@ allow river beds that only carried water after the heavy summer r@@ ains .
The old man , meanwhile , seemed to be watching their an@@ tics with some amusement .
You just didnt hear us , Naisa said .
The rest of the time it was cold and dark .
Y@@ our@@ e the b@@ oring one , she shouted then ran off laugh@@ ing down the road before he had time to answer .
Naisa just shook her head .
School was fun today , she said .
Ye@@ ars ago .
No , you havent !
You sh@@ ouldnt cre@@ ep up on a person like that , he said shar@@ ply .
THE S@@ UN AND THE CHI@@ L@@ D@@ RE@@ N
Please tell us , beg@@ ged Naisa , I h@@ ate it when I only get half a story .
The old man seemed to need time to think about this .
Yes , w@@ ed love to hear the story , sir , she said then throwing her brother a sharp look , wouldnt we , Aice ? .
Her brother just shrugged .
This time it was the old mans turn to sh@@ rug , but you havent told us how this happened .
Then he fixed his eyes on Aice .
Naisa , meanwhile was getting to her feet and stra@@ ightening out her d@@ ress .
That sounds dangerous , Naisa remarked then mou@@ th@@ ed the word Sorry when she saw the look the old man was giving her .
Any@@ way , the old man continued , Later that day , the two children saw the sun-man lying on the ground and cre@@ pt over to him .
She had a plan to change things .
Thats why I carry this stick with me , he said , holding up a tree branch .
The moment I close my eyes , the moon comes out .
It was the girl who was the first to find her voice , he continued .
When he saw the two children holding onto his elbows he said , What do you two think youre doing ?
Yes , it was a very good idea , Naisa agreed .
If I have your permission that is ? the old man said looking very dar@@ k@@ ly at Aice .
Ye@@ ah , Du@@ h !
I mean , sometimes the moon comes out at night and then its quiet b@@ right , but .
Wh@@ ats so wrong about that ? snapped Naisa .
What do you mean you need my help ? the sun-man asked .
So the boy and the girl got some skins and then when everything was ready the girl coun@@ ted one , two , three , then they lifted up the sun-mans elbows .
Then the job would be quick and easy , dont you think so , S@@ is ? .
They sh@@ ould@@ ve done that in the first place , said Aice , knowingly .
That was sil@@ ly of him , gr@@ umb@@ led Aice .
Naisa , however , ch@@ ose not to answer .
And do you know what she did ?
I havent got to the end of the story yet , so maybe I should finish it .
The boy and girl ple@@ aded with the sun man .
She told her children that if the sun@@ man woke up they were to tell him to do his job .
Then she jer@@ ked her arm back .
Plan B , said Aice help@@ fully .
So , do you want to hear the story or not ? .
Of course the sun-man was hot !
The wom@@ ans plan was that her son would take hold of the sun-mans left el@@ bow and her daughter would take hold of his right el@@ bow and then , on her signal , they would lift them up .
Then he looked at Naisa .
Do you really ? .
He sounds gr@@ ump@@ y , said Naisa , but the old man didnt answer her .
When it gets too big and too bo@@ ast@@ ful I use this stick to pro@@ d it until it burs@@ ts like a bal@@ lo@@ on .
What do you mean she had a plan ? asked Aice .
The moon got thrown up into the sky by the children , too , the old man explained .
Well , maybe the girl thought hed be warm not hot .
The mothers plan was simple : All the village children hid around the sun@@ mans house .
Do you two think you could stop arguing ? said the old man , looking from one to the other .
That was when the sun@@ man came to life ang@@ ry at being disturbed .
Y@@ ou@@ d need some very th@@ ick gloves , her brother said when they were a hundred metres down the road . To p@@ ick up the sun , I mean .
That was a very interesting story , sir , he said , but I think Naisa and I would have done a much better job of getting the sun-man into the sky than the children in your story .
So youre telling us the sun-man was so laz@@ y he just lay on the ground all the time , said Aice .
I always think its very important to have a Plan B ? Aice remarked looking very pleased with himself .
Yes , I sup@@ pose so , Aice agreed , looking rather thoug@@ ht@@ ful .
Aice was drawing a cir@@ cle on the ground with his foot and then next to it another smaller cir@@ cle .
The sun-man was very hot , you see .
Thank you , sir , she said .
And the moon ? asked Naisa .
Aice muttered something under his bre@@ ath that neither of them could hear , but didnt argue the point .
If you ask me , h@@ es not a very n@@ ice person , remarked Naisa .
Mr S@@ un-@@ man , she said very polit@@ ely , we need your help .
Yes , thats right .
His job was to fly across the sky with his arms out so that the sun sh@@ one down on the rice fields .
The boy and the girl went home to their mother , taking with them the bad news that the sun-man wouldnt help them .
What did she expect ?
She told her children to cre@@ ep up on the sun-man when he was asleep .
She called her children to her .
Please carry on , sir , said Naisa . My brother w@@ ont interrup@@ t again , will you , Aice ?
One of the mothers had an idea however .
Every month the moon gets bigger and bigger .
He was s@@ nor@@ ing loudly and very slowly the girl reached out and touched him on the hand .
But I thought she was supposed to tell the sun-man to do his job ? said Aice .
Sud@@ denly , a bl@@ ast of heat and bl@@ inding light sp@@ illed out onto the ground .
That was when the little girl told the sun-man how cold they were and that they needed the sun@@ light from his arm@@ pits to dry the rice they@@ d grown , but the sun@@ man didnt seem to care much about their problems .
She explained to her children that all the heat and light in the world came from the sun-mans arm@@ pits , but that it stayed cold and dark because he lay on the ground most of the time .
Right ? . I gu@@ ess so , Aice g@@ igg@@ led .
D@@ ont talk to me about the moon , the sun-man shouted .
That was when the sun-man became very cross .
No , sir , we dont , Naisa answered .
But she had a plan .
Of course Im right ! he re@@ tor@@ ted , but then Im always right , ar@@ ent I ? he added with a gr@@ in .
Oh , the woman had thought of that , too .
The moment the boy mentioned the word moon he went red in the face and looked very ang@@ ry .
Yes , sir .
Is your brother always like this ? he asked .
Aice looked at his sister .
Yes , Aice , she said patiently , Im sure youre right .
Then to her brother , Com@@ e , Aice , we@@ ve got to get home now .
Do his job ! Aice laug@@ hed .
Re@@ ally ? . Yes .
And I thought you said you wouldnt interrup@@ t again ! the old man said dar@@ ting a look at him .
But what would happen if the sun-man woke up ? asked Naisa .
Yes , well she didnt , did she , answered the old man , so@@ unding even more irrit@@ ated , if that were possible .
When he fell asleep again , they all rushed up , grabbed his arms and leg@@ s and threw him up into the sky , where he grew big and fat and turned into the sun .
I thought you said that he went to live in the sky ? .
After that all thats left is its back@@ bone , which is how the new moon is born .
I wouldnt do that , said Aice .
That was when the girl came up with the idea of wr@@ apping some skins around the sun@@ mans elbows so that they wouldnt burn their fingers when they lifted up his arms .
It starts small and thin , slowly gets bigger and bigger until the sun p@@ ok@@ es it with its stick then the cycle begins again .
No , Im sure you wouldnt , the old man said giving him a hard look , but the two children in the story were pol@@ ite and did what they were told .
Im sorry my brother seems to have left his man@@ ners at home today .
And one of those th@@ ick jack@@ ets and a protective hel@@ met , the type that fir@@ em@@ en wear .
It follows me everywhere .
I like to sleep in the dark too , agreed her brother .
Its so full of its own importance it s@@ wells up .
Th@@ ings dont always go as planned , you know !
That was a good idea , wasnt it ?
The boy touched the sun-mans el@@ bow too , and he also jer@@ ked his hand back because hed burnt his fingers .
Then he gave a huge sig@@ h and told them to go away and leave him alone .
You carry on , sir , he said very gener@@ ously , making the old man close his eyes for a moment before continuing .
Naisa just shrugged as if to say that she couldnt understand boys either .
The sun-man eyed the girl very suspici@@ ously , said the old man , picking up the story where he had left off .
That was when all the mothers got together and came up with a second plan .
C@@ ant you see how dark and cold it is ? they said , but the sun man said that he lik@@ ed the dark because he slept better .

On behalf of the Provincial Government of KwaZulu-Natal , I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the Zondi cl@@ an , the family , relatives , friends and the community of Ms@@ inga , particularly the people of eNgome .
KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government has taken a decision to name the new Development Centre at eNgome , which is scheduled to be officially opened next month , the Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi Development Centre .
I thank you .
In 2007 , the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs approved a stipend system for Izind@@ una who are members of traditional councils .
In honour of this development activ@@ ist , the
We would prefer to have no crime at all .
Mur@@ der decreased by 10 ,7 ; Att@@ emp@@ ted murder decreased by 6 ,6 ; R@@ ape decreased by 1 ,8 ; One of the programmes envisaged for the , soon to be established , Centre for Reconciliation and Di@@ alogue will be to promote the heritage of peace and help young people to des@@ ist from violent and criminal activities .
We did not know that this event , on 3 January 2009 , would be our final encounter with the living Inkosi Zondi .
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi passed away at a time when government programmes , to improve the traditional leadership system in the province , are beginning to bear fruit .
In 1994 , a new democratic era daw@@ ned on South Africa .
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was the ultimate model of the kind of partnerships an Inkosi should , now@@ ad@@ ays , establish in order to improve the lot of his people .
In addition , officials from the Gre@@ ater Man@@ chester Police have trained volunteers to do local patrols .
Most of what Inkosi Bhambatha lived for , fought for and died for has been achieved .
The deployment took place in priority areas .
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was murdered at Umlazi , exactly nine days ago , on 22 January .
On 11 June 2006 we assembled , at eNgome , to pron@@ ounce that we rescind the decision of the Governor of the colon@@ y of Natal , passed on 23 February , 1906 , to dep@@ ose Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi .
The remaining districts will soon have the programme as well .
And so Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi was , pos@@ th@@ um@@ ously , re@@ - instated by this caring Government .
This is in accordance with the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act , 2003 and the KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act , 2005 . For the first time , women and youth are legally expected to participate in matters regarding traditional institutions .
However , we are confident that , together , we can turn the tide against crime and we are , certainly , achieving some success in this regard .
Again , in 2008 , the travelling expenses for all Amakh@@ osi were reviewed to be in line with the Department of Transport tariffs .
This was done in consultation with the South African Police Service .
We live in the age of hope through peace , democracy and development .
He was a modern@@ ist who valued traditions and the change of traditions to su@@ it modern times .
In 2008 , the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs employed Managers for all eleven Local Houses of Traditional Leadership .
Indeed , we have lost a transform@@ ational leader , an Inkosi who put his people first , and saw government as a strategic partner in the development of his area .
These volunteers are working together with the Police to ensure that people are safer in their communities .
Crime and criminality is a scourge that continues to bed@@ evil our communities .
Con@@ sequ@@ ently , Joint Coordinating Committees were established between local municipalities and traditional councils .
F@@ ighting for the development and freedom from poverty of his people was a tradition which he inherited from his great@@ -@@ grand@@ father , Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi .
The success of the 2006 commemoration can be attributed to Inkosi Mbongeleni Z@@ ond@@ is progressive outlook towards life .
After various consultations , the Volunte@@ er Social Crime Prevention Programme was first pil@@ oted in selected municipal districts such as Ugu , Uth@@ ukela , Amajuba , Ethekwini , Umg@@ ungundlovu and Umkh@@ any@@ akude .
We are assembled here today to lay to rest the late Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi , a desc@@ end@@ ant of Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi - the her@@ o of the 1906 Pol@@ l Tax U@@ pris@@ ings . In 1906 , the colonial government of Natal imposed a pol@@ l tax on all African males in the province .
Other Distinguished Gu@@ ests Members of the Media Ladies and G@@ ent@@ lemen
Government is working tirelessly to reduce crime .
While most citizens are working hard towards building a peaceful and prosperous KwaZulu- Natal , criminals , who are a minority , are spending their time planning the destruction of lives and property .
Most of what Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi lived for and believed in is being achieved everyday .
Our people are living in fear of criminals .
Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi was murdered by colonial forces at M@@ ome G@@ orge in June 1906 .
We will continue to declare war on crime .
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was very instrumental in the partnership that the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government established with the Zondi people during the 2006 Comm@@ emor@@ ation of the Centenary of the 1906 U@@ pris@@ ings .
In 2006 , Government established the Provincial House of Traditional Leadership and 11 Local Houses of Traditional Leadership .
Today we live in the age of hope and respect for human dignity .
AD@@ D@@ RES@@ S BY KWAZULU-NATAL PR@@ EM@@ I@@ ER SIB@@ US@@ ISO N@@ DEB@@ ELE AT THE FUN@@ ERAL OF THE L@@ ATE IN@@ K@@ OS@@ I M@@ B@@ ONG@@ EL@@ ENI Z@@ ON@@ DI H@@ EL@@ D AT ENG@@ OM@@ E NE@@ AR G@@ RE@@ Y@@ T@@ O@@ W@@ N ON SA@@ T@@ UR@@ DA@@ Y , 31 J@@ AN@@ U@@ ARY 2009
This is helping to close the gap between crime and the fear of crime .
We say farewell to this friend of peace , democracy and development .
The last pieces of the gathering of evidence are being put together and arrests will be made soon .
Annual crime statistics for KwaZulu-Natal reflect that in the 2006@@ /@@ 7 and 2007@@ /@@ 8 financial years , the following trends emerged :
B@@ esides normal policing , the Provincial Government has also implemented the Volunte@@ er Social Crime Prevention Programme which en@@ lists volunteers from the community to reduce crime and ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour .
The National Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act , 2003 and the KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act , 2005 ush@@ ered a new phase in the administration of traditional institutions .
Furthermore , in 2008 , all out of p@@ oc@@ ket expenses for traditional council members were reimb@@ ur@@ sed by the department .
Izind@@ una will be able to have financial resources that will help them to fully and effectively exec@@ ute the tasks of traditional councils .
He presented many proposals to Government , all aimed at bringing a better life to the people of eNgome .
Programme Director , Mr . President of the African National Congress , Mr .
To promote partnerships and syner@@ gy between traditional institutions and municipal structures , the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs held joint Exco meetings between municipal and traditional leadership structures .
To date , 1 200 volunteers have been identified and trained on basic first aid and self-defence .
The SAPS are currently closing in on his murder@@ ers .
The process of transformation in traditional leadership structures has resulted in , over 90 , of traditional authorities being transformed into traditional councils .
On 3 January , 2009 , the President of the ANC , Mr . Jacob Zuma , and I were here at eNgome at the invitation of the late Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi and the Zondi cl@@ an , who hosted a ceremony in honour of the ANC President and I . Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi always worked towards strengthening ties between his community and government .

The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today , as I have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the General Elections of that year .
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent ;
May@@ ors and leaders in our system of local government ;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy ;
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ;
I am happy to report that with regard to each of these commitments , government remains hard at work to ensure that the nations objectives are met .
I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Or@@ ders .
Having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 !
President Nelson Mandela and Madame G@@ rac@@ a Mac@@ he@@ l ;
Investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15 ,8 .
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this aug@@ ust occasion . But that was not to be .
increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world .
His death was as shoc@@ king and myster@@ ious as his life was a lo@@ dest@@ ar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today .
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ;
to improve our export performance , focus@@ sing on services and manufactured goods ;
to intensify the housing programme ;
We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fort@@ night ago confirmed the determination of all our people , regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream
I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activ@@ ists of the 19@@ 56 Wom@@ ens March and the 1976 Soweto U@@ pr@@ ising who are sitting in the Presidents box , as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today .
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture ;
At an average of over 4 ,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 .
We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa .
to implement programmes to ensure broad@@ -based black economic empowerment ;
We must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society !
Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ;
It was a place in which to be born black was to inher@@ it a lifelong cur@@ se .
It was a place in which squ@@ al@@ or , the st@@ ench of poverty , the open sew@@ ers , the dec@@ aying ro@@ t , the m@@ illing crowds of w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edness , the un@@ ending images of a landscape stre@@ wn with car@@ el@@ essly abandoned refuse , assum@@ ed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of ti@@ dy streets , and wo@@ oded lanes , and flowers bl@@ os@@ som@@ s off@@ setting the green and singing grass , and birds and houses fit for k@@ ings and que@@ ens , and ly@@ r@@ ical music , and love .
Director@@ s@@ -General and other leaders of the public service ;
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP ; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensi@@ tivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by nam@@ ing two of our National Or@@ ders after them - the Order of Luthuli , and the Order of the Comp@@ an@@ ions of O .@@ R .
Res@@ pond@@ ing to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream , our government committed itself , working with all South Africans , to implement detailed programmes intended :
It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to pre@@ y on you or to condem@@ n on@@ es@@ elf to pre@@ y on others , guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug st@@ u@@ por@@ s that would d@@ ull the pain of living , who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause .
We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy .
to expand access to such services as water , electricity and sanitation ;
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole ;
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ;
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy ;
Today , fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product at about 18 ,4 is at its highest since 1991 .
We pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sac@@ r@@ ific@@ ed for our freedom , as well as to you , our friends from the rest of the world , that we will never be@@ tr@@ ay the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform South Africa into a democratic , peaceful , non@@ racial , nons@@ exist and prosperous country , committed to the noble vision of human solidarity .
Once more , we convey our condolences to the Tambo family .
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation ;
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ;
The work to create that South Africa has begun .
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ;
Governor of the Reserve Bank ;
However , I am indeed very pleased to acknowledge in our midst this morning the Hon Alber@@ tina Luthuli , daughter of our first Nobel Peace Laure@@ ate , Inkosi Albert Luthuli , whose tragic death 40 years ago we commemor@@ ate this year , remembering the tragic day when it was reported that he had been cr@@ ushed by a speeding train in the can@@ e-@@ fields of KwaD@@ ukuza .
On that occasion we said in part :
It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden r@@ age
At its annual January Lekgotla or Bos@@ ber@@ a@@ ad last month , the National Cabinet that stands at the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid@@ -term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections .
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth , reconstruction and development of our country ;
N@@ one of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty .
Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year , we celebrate the 90@@ th anniversary of the birth of her husband , the father of her children , her comp@@ an@@ ion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , Oliver Reg@@ inald Tambo .
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament ;
Fif@@ ty years before , as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People , which adopted the Freedom Charter , the patriots of the day had said , Let us speak together , all of us together African and European , Indian and Col@@ oured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom . And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .
When she died , we knew that Mama A@@ delaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital .
Tom@@ or@@ row we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains .
President F .@@ W . de Klerk and Madame El@@ ita de Klerk ;
That work will continue during our Second Dec@@ ade of Freedom .
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Jud@@ iciary ;
With your indulgence , I would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , convened at our seat of government the Union Build@@ ings in Tshwane on Freedom Day , the 10@@ th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the In@@ aug@@ uration of the President of the Republic , whom our Parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democ@@ ra@@ tically demonstrated during the 2004 elections .
Our honoured traditional leaders ;
This relates to everything , from the improvement of the health of our people , to reducing the levels of crime , raising the levels of literacy and numeracy , and opening the doors of learning and culture to all
Heads of our Security Services ;
Your Excellencies , Ambassad@@ ors and High Commissioners ;
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2007
For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ;
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector ;
to increase spending on scientific research and development ;
People of South Africa :
We have gathered here today , on Freedom Day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , who are our comr@@ ad@@ es@@ -in-@@ arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say an end to all that !
While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex .
In this context , address all ind@@ igence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ;
The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years .
This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty .
It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone , 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 .
Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still wo@@ efully low .
As such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda .
A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensif@@ ication of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion .
What has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induc@@ tion of public servants .
These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Mol@@ oto R@@ ail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started , the Klip@@ fontein Corridor in Cape Town and the G@@ au@@ train project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system .
It is encouraging that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the recent period , been within man@@ ag@@ eable ranges , as the programmes reach mat@@ urity .
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty ;
For instance , in September last year , 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers ; in the North@@ west Province , the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50 ; and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements .
We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme .
It is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage .
In other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral dec@@ ay , and work to attain the happiness that comes with it .
While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted .
Compl@@ iance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed .
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions .
This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market .
The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us .
I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime .
In this year of the 60@@ th anniversary of the Doc@@ tors P@@ act of leaders of African and Indian communities , the 30@@ th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20@@ th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikan@@ er intellectuals to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of id@@ entities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canv@@ ass@@ ed across society , in a manner that strength@@ ens our unity as a nation .
As Honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport .
Accel@@ er@@ ate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored .
However , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected .
These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year .
Ob@@ viously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent .
In this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of As@@ gi@@ SA , over and above the multi-@@ year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year :
and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . From ow@@ ning just over 3 of the market cap@@ italisation of the J@@ SE in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ;
According to the United Nations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation .
Prom@@ oting peace and security will involve all people .
Co-@@ ordinate and align all anti-@@ poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid w@@ ast@@ age and dupl@@ ication ;
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial .
I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President P@@ hum@@ zile M@@ lambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative , working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team , con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-@@ absor@@ ption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system .
In the words of the UN@@ DP Human Development Report of 2006 :
Ob@@ viously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime .
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme . But there is no question that this programme can and must be rat@@ ch@@ eted upwards quite significantly .
We should indeed celebrate this great achievement .
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . Many more are without electricity and sanitation .
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are exp@@ ended , are actually met .
And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level .
It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metro@@ s have held their Growth and Development Sum@@ mits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February .
In the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage .
Over the past three years , the economy has created some one-@@ and-@@ half million jobs .
In the 1994 R@@ DP White Paper we said :
Cer@@ tainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , clos@@ eted behind walls and bar@@ bed wire , ever anx@@ ious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces .
It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected
We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks , informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Ag@@ enda , which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public , and strengthening the Ward Committees 80 of which have been established across the country .
While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations .
We are on course to put an end to this dehumanis@@ ing system in these areas by the end of this year .
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed , we will :
This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development .
On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution .
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things :
An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace .
At the same time , the number of Matr@@ ic students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 .
While we have already sur@@ passed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security .
The continuing occas@@ ional vol@@ a@@ tility of our currency has also not bod@@ ed well for our export industries .
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-@@ employment through small and micro-enterprises .
Further , on this the 30@@ th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Week@@ end World newspapers , we are d@@ uty-@@ bound to ask the question - have we all fully intern@@ alised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together !
Mon@@ itor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in grad@@ uating them out of poverty ;
complete the process of reviewing the countr@@ ys experience in the articul@@ ation among such macro-economic indicators as the Ex@@ change Rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tr@@ ad@@ ables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absor@@ b large pools of semi-@@ skilled workers ;
Honourable Members ;
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African Women in Di@@ alogue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some defects in our systems in this regard .
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to aff@@ lic@@ t many of our people .
By 2005 , South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Go@@ al in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 .
Def@@ ine clearly the poverty mat@@ ri@@ x of our country ;
We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people .
We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole .
While beneficiaries of social grants numb@@ ered about 8 million in 2004 , today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants .
The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private aff@@ air of the private sector .
South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy R@@ ight@@ s-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid , partly through right@@ s-based entit@@ l@@ ements .
We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs .
But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs .
and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery .
This applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates .
This will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities .
This applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel v@@ etting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash@@ -@@ delivery vehicles , and so on .
We are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the back@@ lo@@ g in the eradication of the buc@@ ket system in established settlements by almost half .
And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure , improve the management of B@@ order Control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented .
Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population der@@ ive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation .
We must act to change this situation .
Peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment Dec@@ isi@@ ve action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children .
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ;
Qu@@ ite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate .
We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty .
Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections , induc@@ tion programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new .
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue ap@@ ace .
We will undertake a careful review of the inhib@@ iting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up .
These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , comb@@ ining both road and rail .
The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ;
And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs .
Access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved .
The fluctu@@ ating Matr@@ ic pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabil@@ ise the system and ensure steady improvement .
The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metro@@ s .
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process .
We should dare to act in concer@@ t to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .
We hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security .
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ;
However , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot under@@ play the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , C@@ te dIvoire and Somalia .
One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy res@@ umption of the Doha Development Round of W@@ TO negotiations .
But no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . We are not there yet .
This year the African Pe@@ er Review Forum will complete its review of our country .
In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Per@@ sian Gulf .
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in India , Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as Japan , Europe and North America .
And so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share .
We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Com@@ oros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concer@@ ted action for economic reconstruction and social development .
We should today , even more confid@@ ently , speak together of freedom .
We should not and do not under@@ play the many difficulties we still confront . Since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better .
Is@@ sued by : The Presidency February 2007
We are convinced that solutions to the log@@ jams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fr@@ u@@ ition .
But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society .
Thank you .
Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia .
Cr@@ itical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the prot@@ agon@@ ists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation .
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legisl@@ ators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy .
Similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes .
Just over a month ago , South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-@@ permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study , the National Income D@@ ynam@@ ics Study .
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multi@@ purpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational ;
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres ; conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ;
further capac@@ itate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership .
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year :
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards , remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and p@@ ensions ;
As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 2@@ 80 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a sn@@ ap@@ shot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country .
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres , including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system ;
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings .
Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
We are proud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of P@@ atr@@ ice L@@ um@@ umba . Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-@@ and-@@ half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region .
Improv@@ ing governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation .
In this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 .
These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as m@@ igration , labour market transi@@ tions , inter-@@ gener@@ ational mobility and household formation and dis@@ solution .
while intensifying the public sector and national an@@ ticorruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our an@@ ticorruption strategies for all spheres of government ;
In this regard , we are heart@@ ened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime .
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service , in order mas@@ sively to reduce case backlogs ;
continue with the processes further to capac@@ itate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ;
Further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency .
finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning , in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy ;
improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating .
In this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-@@ economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention .
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens .
I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vit@@ ally important Community Police Forums .
As we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals .
implement the programmes decided upon to build more correc@@ tions facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Correc@@ tions ;
implement the recommendations of the Kh@@ amp@@ epe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations ;
ensuring the implementation , without further delay , of measures to reduce the cost of medicines ;
start the process of further modern@@ ising the systems of the South African Revenue Services , especially in respect of border control , and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard ;
intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime , building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cash-in-transit he@@ ists , drug trafficking and po@@ aching of game and abalone ;
speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project , implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the B@@ us R@@ ap@@ id Transi@@ t System in the Metro@@ s and recapitalisation of Metrorail : and in this regard , let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SAN@@ T@@ AC@@ O will not be bul@@ li@@ ed into aband@@ oning the taxi recapitalisation project , and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of sel@@ fish interests will be dealt with accordingly ;
continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police , and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years , and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced ;
What we should under@@ line though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NE@@ DL@@ AC .
In addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years .
This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 .
a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings , death , disability and unemployment benefits .
The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Spe@@ ech .
continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system ;
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution ;
continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals , and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers ;
a wage subsidy for low-@@ wage employees , possibly directed at first entrants into the job market , especially young people ;
The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies .
We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible .
All these efforts , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security .
R@@ ather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and correc@@ tions officers , and functionaries of the justice system .
expanding access to Early Childhood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme ;
In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year :
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include :
speeding up of the construction of low-cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to handle finances , pil@@ oting of the Land Use Management Bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the m@@ uch@@ -@@ del@@ ayed agreement with the private sector on low-cost housing are finalised ;
In this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment .
bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology , and ensure the optim@@ um utilisation of the fingerprint database indeed , many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems ;
The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrif@@ ice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security .
expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxili@@ aries , increasing the number of training institutions , improving the quality of training , and instituting a bursary system ;
In the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include :
continuing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various str@@ ains of TB , road accidents and violent crime .
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented .
This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common , administr@@ atively efficient social insurance system , while those ear@@ ning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes .
We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion , including the comprehensive and integrated anti-@@ poverty strategy we have mentioned , as well as address issues pertaining to national unity , value systems and identity .
For us it is not a mere cl@@ ich to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society .
In addition , Telkom will apply a special low rate for international band@@ width to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the B@@ PO sector . These centres will be established in areas identified by government .
take further practical action to improve access to micro-@@ finance including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-@@ credit fund ; ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency , SE@@ DA ;
having sur@@ passed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , en@@ rol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings ;
This is that the contribut@@ ory ear@@ ning@@ s-@@ related pill@@ ar of our social security system is missing or un@@ reliable for large numbers of working people .
In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever .
We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organis@@ ing Committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing .
With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a State Diam@@ ond Tr@@ ader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cut@@ ters and producers .
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods .
Qu@@ ite clearly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy .
intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work , including a youth cooperatives programme , and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , big and small , which have responded in a splend@@ id and practical manner to this initiative ;
In this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Ac@@ quisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training instit@@ utes and others .
start implementing the Commun@@ al Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , se@@ eds and impl@@ ements to small and cooperative farmers .
We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the Regul@@ atory Imp@@ act Assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broad@@ band capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities .
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that art@@ isan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification .
process the Companies Bill , adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday , as part of the bat@@ tery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ;
We are happy that De@@ Be@@ ers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ;
St@@ ar@@ ting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions .
Because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things :
The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries .
A critical part of this reform will be the task of rep@@ air@@ ing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of In@@ quir@@ y into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa .
develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes , including capital goods in ICT , transport and energy : with regard to energy , we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation , natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy .
As the Honourable Members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-@@ fee paying schools .
With regard to communications , I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers .
The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available art@@ is@@ ans .
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible .
The principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an ear@@ ning@@ s-@@ related contribut@@ ory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity .
After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided .
At the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system .
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Out@@ sourcing , tourism , bio-@@ fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ;
develop an overarching strategy to priorit@@ ise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation , agriculture and ag@@ ro-@@ processing , the white goods sector , creative industries , community and social services and pharmac@@ euticals .
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society .
What she expects as her birthday present is the truth .
further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and ,
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term , the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities on which it must focus in a special way , using these as catal@@ ysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue .
This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the ap@@ ologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to cont@@ end with the consequences of load sh@@ ed@@ ding .
They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrif@@ ices .
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not dis@@ appoint her .
My answer to this question is a definite No !
And so I quote these words :
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP ;
We acknowledge , both among the Honourable Members and our guests , the many found@@ ers of the United Democratic Fr@@ ont , 25 years ago .
I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela , one of the pre-@@ eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90@@ th birthday on 18 July this year .
More than at any other time , the situation that confron@@ ts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands !
All these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a rel@@ ay race of continuous re@@ birth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans .
As we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is Business Unusual !
Indeed , they represent a celebration of the ind@@ om@@ itable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not be@@ tr@@ ay or dis@@ appoint the expectations of the people .
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to norm@@ alise the situation .
In this situation , we have to curtail the un@@ planned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve marg@@ in .
I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 .
I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and for@@ bearing in the face of the current difficulties .
The main categories of these priorities are :
While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , non@@ racial , nons@@ exist and prosperous South Africa .
Chairperson of SALGA , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ;
There are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take .
Allow me on this occasion of the pen@@ ultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year .
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ;
They are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impover@@ ish especially the poor .
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations .
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections .
This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but sur@@ moun@@ table challenges .
On the supply side Eskom is working fur@@ iously to ensure the introduction of co-@@ generation projects as a matter of urgency .
The national emergency represented by the current power out@@ ages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course .
To make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities .
He suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , I should recall the well-known words with which Charles D@@ ick@@ ens opened his novel , A T@@ ale of Two C@@ ities .
You will ask whether I agree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , un@@ sure of our steps , un@@ steady on our feet , fear@@ ful of the future !
the further accel@@ eration of our economic growth and development
In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has out@@ stripped the new capacity we have brought on stream .
But if all of us can for@@ ge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through I hope relatively un@@ sc@@ athed This is not a time for fing@@ er pointing , but for working together in finding solutions .
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people .
Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters .
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008
I say this because , in our own estim@@ ation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream .
As the Honourable Members know , she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil .
S@@ ure , the problems here are serious ; overcoming them will require ingen@@ uity , especially in energy efficiency and energy saving , as well as the development of alternative power supplies .
The details of other voluntary and mand@@ atory actions in the Power Conserv@@ ation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published .
The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energ@@ ise our advance towards the realisation of the all-@@ important goal of a better life for all our people .
We welcome to this occasion Mr Ar@@ thur Marg@@ eman , representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boy@@ c@@ ott of fifty years ago , who include Nelson Mandela .
These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our comp@@ atriots , may give to us and share with one another .
As I was preparing this Address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buff@@ eted by strong cros@@ sw@@ inds that made it especially difficult to for@@ es@@ ee where our country will be tomorrow .
We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jan@@ n Tur@@ ner , the daughter of R@@ ick Tur@@ ner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago .
Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the creation of the South Africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our Constitution .
Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting , solar water heating and g@@ ey@@ ser load management in households , including housing standards for all new houses and developments .
The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy .
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy , and poverty eradication
And such is the inj@@ unction that history has imposed on us today .
rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge .
The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conv@@ eys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest , that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people , but also to many others outside our borders .
In this regard , I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Carr@@ ol@@ l , when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week , on Tuesday , February 5 .
It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wis@@ dom , it was the age of fool@@ ish@@ ness , it was the ep@@ oc@@ h of belief , it was the ep@@ oc@@ h of incred@@ ul@@ ity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Dar@@ kness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heav@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the super@@ la@@ tive degree of compar@@ ison only .
Among other things , we must use the current adv@@ ersity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient .
Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation .
And precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity !
We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-@@ saving measures .
I speak here today in the presence of my mother , E@@ pain@@ ette Mbeki , Ma@@ Mofokeng , who came to communicate an unequiv@@ ocal message from the rural masses of the Trans@@ kei , among whom she has lived for many decades .
They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the an@@ archy represented by the criminal tor@@ ching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month .
We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later .
She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today .
In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 92 years old .
This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police , the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes .
We are also pleased that we have among us Mr D@@ in@@ il@@ esizwe Sobukwe , son of the outstanding patri@@ ot and leader , Robert Sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , ban@@ ishment and other forms of repression .
Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundam@@ entals that have informed our countr@@ ys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place .
An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and sh@@ ame those who do not .
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative Business Unusual !
I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspir@@ ation of our people to attain a better life for all .
Some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States .
Mr Jacob Zuma , Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress ;
However , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard .
The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 .
However , like all the Honourable Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troub@@ led by a deep sense of un@@ ease about where our country will be tomorrow .
Happ@@ ily , this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which , the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week .
Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jer@@ emi@@ ads typical of the pro@@ ph@@ ets of d@@ oom .
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves .
The sense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-@@ round preparations , is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !
We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turb@@ ine projects .
This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very che@@ ap and abund@@ ant electricity has come to an end .
Further , after correc@@ ting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the Kh@@ a R@@ i G@@ ude mass literacy campaign .
We must therefore continue to support the mining industry .
Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the under@@ sea cables .
However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient .
I am certain that the South African Foot@@ ball Association , our coaches led by Car@@ los Alber@@ to Par@@ reira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud .
the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equ@@ alising the age of eligibility at 60 , thus benefiting about half a million men ;
Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Ac@@ quisition will be intensified .
This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-@@ owned Enterprises and over@@ laying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their tim@@ ing and geographic location .
Indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity .
At the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal pos@@ ture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability .
Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned .
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates , complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security , further give life to the Victims Charter , pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders , and continue the implementation of additional measures der@@ iving from recommendations of the Tr@@ uth and Reconciliation Commission .
We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud .
Madame Speaker and Chairperson
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women , with emphasis on providing training and markets , including linking them up with established outlets ;
We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the countr@@ ys war against poverty , in pursuit of socioeconomic inclusion .
Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elabor@@ ation of an integrated and comprehensive anti-@@ poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge .
Al@@ ong with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme .
Working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer d@@ ur@@ ables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and ag@@ ro-@@ processing .
We will launch this syn@@ chron@@ ised process soon , guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees .
Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment-@@ creation .
Madame Speaker and Chairperson , When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder buc@@ king the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy .
We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry .
However , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity .
The second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a syn@@ chron@@ ised process across all provinces so we can create a base sl@@ ate of changes we propose .
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all .
We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services .
Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-@@ creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors .
As the Honourable Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime .
Accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infr@@ ac@@ o .
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week .
N@@ ext week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country .
Accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system in its tot@@ ality .
At the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year .
Having noted that the t@@ ard@@ iness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of Business Unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes .
Coll@@ ective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency .
As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation .
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency .
I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24@@ th of January .
I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournam@@ ents successfully .
In this regard , R2 ,3 billion has been budg@@ eted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy .
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises .
The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be rec@@ ited by learners in their morning school assemb@@ lies , as well as a Youth Pl@@ edge ext@@ ol@@ ling the virt@@ ues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans .
Among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistr@@ acy , the police , prosecutors , correc@@ tional services and the Legal A@@ id Board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums .
We must ensure that we sustain this approach .
Once more we thank the Spring@@ b@@ oks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year .
The approach is one of common action rather than rec@@ rimin@@ ation .
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP ;
intensifying the Expanded Public Works Programme which , by sur@@ passing the set targets , has shown potential to absor@@ b more entrants : this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure , doubl@@ ing the number of children enrolled in Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed , and increasing the number of careg@@ ivers .
An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development .
Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan .
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can .
Task teams are currently working in many areas .
For this , we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nong@@ overn@@ mental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency .
C@@ utting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right .
In a meeting with the Chairman of General Elec@@ tric during the course of last week , G@@ E offered to assist by proc@@ uring scarce turb@@ ine equipment on our behalf .
As such , in the spirit of Business Unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to allev@@ iate their plight in those individual households .
In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol , Anglo and BH@@ P Bill@@ it@@ on are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constrain@@ t .
We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period .
We are taking steps to enhance Es@@ kom@@ s maintenance capacity .
introduc@@ ing the system of products for prefer@@ ential procurement by government from small , medium and micro-enterprises ; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rig@@ orous system to ensure that the 30@@ -@@ day payment period is observed .
We are a minerals resource economy .
Of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-@@ ab@@ iding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our Constitution enj@@ o@@ ins us to observe in our daily lives and pronounc@@ ements .
In@@ formed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Kh@@ amp@@ epe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing refl@@ ections on this matter , including the reform of the Criminal Justice System , we shall by the end of March this year , interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime .
The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters .
They will be supported by technical teams from E@@ DI Holdings , Eskom and the National Energy Eff@@ iciency Agency .
Indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CE@@ Os of 70 of the J@@ SE@@ -@@ listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills .
All these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve marg@@ in .
Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual !
Att@@ ached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set T@@ op B@@ ox@@ es , which should be finalised by the middle of the year .
I will also shortly announce a team of Energy Champions consisting of prominent and knowled@@ ge@@ able South Africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges .
These are :
Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the autom@@ o@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Mot@@ or Industry Development Programme is maintained .
I will convene a meeting of the Joint Presidential Working Groups to coordinate our overall actions .
In this regard , in the spirit of Business Unusual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system .
In addition to this work we will in the coming period priorit@@ ise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resour@@ cing schools in the lowest three quin@@ tiles , fre@@ eing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-@@ the-@@ job training for professional graduates .
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; and where possible , some projects will be accelerated .
In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated .
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly .
Al@@ ready , money has been allocated for Sentech to become a w@@ ir@@ eless internet wholes@@ al@@ er as well as finance its digit@@ isation .
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid .
What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies .
Of course , I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lov@@ ers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament .
Paral@@ le@@ l to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 .
It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry .
But we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and di@@ alogues and workshops important as these may be .
Among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment .
Accel@@ er@@ ating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS . We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-@@ drug res@@ istant and extreme drug res@@ istant TB patients receive treatment .
speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition , better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support , and improving the capital base and reach of the Mic@@ ro-@@ Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa to provide micro-@@ credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high ev@@ iction rates , and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5 per year , and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up ;
This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will k@@ ick off in our country 8@@ 54 days from today .
R7@@ 00 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme ;
This must inspire Bafana Bafana , as it must inspire our ath@@ letes who will comp@@ ete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year .
scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a grad@@ uated increase of the intake in the M@@ ilitary Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 .
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme .
This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 .
Two such issues deserve brief mention .
In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 2@@ 60 000 housing units per ann@@ um , and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a mor@@ ator@@ ium on the sale of land that can be avail@@ ed for the housing programme .
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29@@ th of March .
Over the past year , we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face .
At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop an@@ ticorruption strategies .
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified der@@ ive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning .
What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course !
What is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the tim@@ ing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution .
To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done .
We call on all African comp@@ atriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments .
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens .
As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations .
I say this with un@@ sh@@ ak@@ eable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history to strain every sinew of our being to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countr@@ ys progress over the last fourteen years has provided .
In the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the W@@ TO Doha Development Round .
Our mul@@ tif@@ ac@@ eted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme .
Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management .
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thr@@ ash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided .
The m@@ ush@@ ro@@ oming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the Chin@@ a-@@ South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength .
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in cont@@ ention for many years .
Further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement .
This includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ oting out corrupt elements and pil@@ oting the new ID card .
We will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council .
It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union , within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible , prem@@ ised on accelerating the development of our region .
Secondly , by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities .
Working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National an@@ ticorruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented .
A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration .
There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state .
This year we celebrate the t@@ ent@@ h anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China .
We are particularly concerned by the sens@@ eless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad , developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent .
Accordingly , we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratul@@ ating the parties to the Zimbabwe Di@@ alogue for their truly comm@@ end@@ able achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter .
Our focus , in promoting the African Ag@@ enda this year , will be on the strengthening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , N@@ ep@@ ad .
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments .
We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-@@ year Local Government Strategic Ag@@ enda .
Imp@@ elled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the Indi@@ a-@@ Brazil@@ -@@ South Africa forums , the New Africa-@@ Asia Strategic Partnership , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SAC@@ U-@@ Merc@@ us@@ or trade agreement .
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chair@@ person@@ ship of SADC in 2008@@ /@@ 2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard .
But we should not take this for granted .
The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Pe@@ er Review Mechanis@@ m .
We had an opportunity , on the fr@@ inges of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter .
Firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such open@@ ings emerging .
These global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup , bring out in even b@@ older relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity .
In short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address .
I am confident that , under the leadership of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Investment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010 .
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya , Chad , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western Sahara , C@@ te dIvoire , Somalia , the Com@@ oros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability .
Cr@@ itical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union .
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision .
Thus , as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government .
With all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels .
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard .
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment .
This we shall do , inspired by the common aspir@@ ation of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels .
Having said all that I have said , I come back to the question : what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008 !
We are confident that , informed by their abh@@ or@@ r@@ ence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achiev@@ es its objectives .
N@@ ext year , South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001 .
If anything , the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants .
Thirdly , recognising that the Department of Home Affairs tou@@ ches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turn@@ around strategy approved by Cabinet .
In this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , Sol@@ omon Kal@@ ushi Mahlangu who went to the g@@ allows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would n@@ our@@ ish the tree of freedom .
In the First Dec@@ ade of Freedom , economic growth aver@@ aged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 .
I have walked that long road to freedom .
Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings , appropriately deploy@@ ing resources from pension and provident funds , housing , financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment ;
In the end , the challenge is as much about regulation ;
Yet access to employment weigh@@ s heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability .
However , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of par@@ ity that we had set ourselves .
Indeed , it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003 , the economy created about one-@@ and-@@ half million net new jobs ;
and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient .
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ;
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services .
But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday , the 7@@ th and 8@@ th of February respectively .
This suggests that the poverty situation has improved remar@@ kab@@ ly , particularly among people experiencing the greatest degree of welfare deprivation .
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ;
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ;
However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the co@@ al-@@ face of direct interaction with the public .
and progressively encouraged the main@@ streaming of these concerns .
Madam Deputy President ;
We do have today a well-@@ functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy .
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition .
Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society .
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production ; the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retren@@ chment has become a reality .
Though some progress has been made , at 0 ,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves .
On a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe :
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans .
In this regard , some five years ago , we were h@@ over@@ ing around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product . Such has been the accel@@ eration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 .
Except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing .
This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime .
For instance , access to potable water has improved from 62 in 1996 to 88 in 2008 ;
This will be combined with promotion of the Pro@@ udly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports .
And so , 15 years into our democracy , we can assert that the fear , the insecurity and the lo@@ ath@@ ing that 100 years ago generated an exclusive and illus@@ ory peace among colonial masters , were not only un@@ founded ; but truly misplaced .
Ir@@ onically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive .
All these are as@@ signments for the coming period .
With regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves .
and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that exp@@ ands access to services and reduces the infl@@ ation@@ ary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability .
A hundred and thirty years on , we can only mar@@ v@@ el at the hope and the resilience that inf@@ used those st@@ out hearts .
These are the issues that the comprehensive rev@@ amp of the criminal justice system has started to address .
and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the 2004 democratic mandate !
Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legisl@@ atures ;
Thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pill@@ ar of all our economic considerations .
We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands .
This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds .
Indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African and Col@@ oured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants .
This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda .
Fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men .
In education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ra@@ ti@@ o ;
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress ;
It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bott@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gr@@ idl@@ ocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner .
Further , our anti@@ retroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world ;
In this regard , Honourable Members , I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society .
At the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas .
Com@@ r@@ ades and friends ;
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presid@@ ing Officers of Parliament ;
Secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes .
Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , Th@@ us@@ ong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm leadership .
On its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis .
Chief Justice Langa ;
and even more remarkable , about 500 000 jobs a year between 2004 and 2007 .
But ours is a journey of hope and resilience .
advancing equity , developing skills , creating economic opportunities and extending services ;
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year sur@@ pass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections .
The fact that the private sector l@@ ags behind in changing the demograph@@ ics of management and skilled occup@@ ations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a l@@ agg@@ ard in the high growth stak@@ es .
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-@@ million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate .
Sh@@ aring the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the f@@ isc@@ us as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods .
I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole .
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that inf@@ used the democratic struggle even when everything looked ble@@ ak ;
As Honourable Members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus .
Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage .
and crimes against women and children have not ab@@ ated in any significant measure , is a matter of great concern .
It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management .
Secondly , although the reduc@@ tions in poverty have been substantial , agg@@ reg@@ ate inequality increased during the 199@@ 0@@ s . Thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved .
That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the United Nations , on the approach to negotiations in South Africa .
Comb@@ ined , these developments bod@@ e ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects .
In a few months from now the people of our country will pron@@ ounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom figh@@ ter and other found@@ ers of our democracy .
These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Go@@ als .
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ;
It points to system@@ ic weaknesses in the criminal justice system , from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders .
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed .
It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the acc@@ ol@@ ade when we pron@@ ounce that whatever economic storms may p@@ ound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consci@@ ousness in a transition our nation is in a good state .
But let us not del@@ ude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nas@@ cent stages .
But I have discovered the secret that after climb@@ ing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more h@@ ills to climb .
Of course we do know that the drop@@ out rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is un@@ accept@@ ably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society .
We hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour !
Indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects appro@@ xim@@ ates the character of our society .
Your Excellencies , Ambassad@@ ors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ;
Indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting rec@@ essions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a slower rate .
In this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 .
HIV impacts most severely on young women .
In this regard , we wish to acknowledge On@@ kgopotse Ti@@ ro@@ s co@@ us@@ in , Pat T@@ l@@ h@@ ag@@ wana .
These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward .
While our approaches may differ , the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ uously set out in our Constitution : to create a united , non@@ racial , nons@@ exist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world .
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
This improvement is mir@@ r@@ ored in access to basic services a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in mon@@ ey@@ -@@ me@@ tric poverty .
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society ;
and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion :
Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staff@@ ing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity .
The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans .
I will however c@@ ite a few instances again to sket@@ ch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face .
but it is expanding all the time , with over 6@@ 90 000 patients having been initiated on anti@@ retroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme .
For inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them .
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ;
to provide efficient , decent and equitable health care ;
The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 on@@ wards .
almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level ;
That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continu@@ ity in the systems of government is thanks to the mat@@ urity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive old and new and the steady hand of our public sector managers .
In this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly .
Sh@@ aring the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirm@@ ative action , including Broad@@ -based Black Economic Empowerment .
We can condem@@ n the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rap@@ ac@@ ious licence of unregulated markets to wre@@ ak hav@@ oc on financial systems .
access to finance and inf@@ lows of capital have turned for the worse ; But we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ;
The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually hal@@ ved over four years .
It is ap@@ t therefore to remind ourselves of that instruc@@ tive observation of hope and resilience , continu@@ ity and change , by former President Nelson Mandela , in his bi@@ ography , L@@ ong Walk to Freedom :
Within this generation are the early leaders of SAS@@ O , which included : Str@@ ini Moodley , Professor Bar@@ ney P@@ ity@@ ana , Steve Biko , On@@ kgopotse Tir@@ o , Harry N@@ eng@@ we@@ khulu , Themba Sono , Map@@ etla Moh@@ api , M@@ osi@@ ou@@ a Lek@@ ota , Johnny Is@@ sel and Mth@@ uli ka Sh@@ ezi .
These then are some of the advances that democracy has brought ;
as it is about consistent enforcement .
A@@ bo@@ ve all , I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today wor@@ l@@ ds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago is a product of the lab@@ ours and to@@ ils of South African women and men from all walks of life .
but from the point of view of government systems , we can draw sol@@ ace from the fact that over 70 of cases of corruption reported in the media become public because government has detected the wrong@@ doing and is in fact acting against it .
I have made mis@@ steps along the way .
creating more jobs , better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment , public works programmes , sector partnerships and strategies , local procurement , small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives ;
And so , Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson , we should ask ourselves : how have our actions defined the path of South African societ@@ ys ev@@ olution in the fif@@ teen years since the birth of our democracy ;
We@@ alth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life .
What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-@@ cycl@@ ical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis .
The focus on micro-@@ economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact .
Alter@@ natives to lay@@ offs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-@@ sharing .
On the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue .
Of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrog@@ ating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy .
However , we should not under@@ estimate the challenges we face .
We can do all this ; and we will be perf@@ ec@@ tly justified .
On the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme .
Yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations .
I have tried not to fal@@ ter ;
Import@@ antly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-@@ absor@@ ption , ensuring that there is decent work .
It may as well be that the systems of preventing and pun@@ ishing corruption are still inadequate ;
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ;
that we should indeed , in the words of the Freedom Charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture !
Firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R6@@ 90@@ -@@ billion for the next three years .
In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Eph@@ ra@@ im Mogale , the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students , and his peers .
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ; State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town February 2009 Mr . Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
Our challenge is to translate these v@@ isions into programmes and projects for effective implementation .
While the consumer b@@ oom , imp@@ elled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canv@@ ass of opportunities for further expansion going forward .
Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities .
and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the elec@@ torate .
Allow me to acknowledge Luc@@ as Mahlangu , brother of Kal@@ ushi , representing the Mahlangu family .
We may even say that , in a strange quir@@ k of f@@ ate , many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past ;
and an improvement in the number of pupils passing mathematics , to quote a few examples .
A group of val@@ iant students broke away from N@@ U@@ SA@@ S to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago .
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ;
Allow me , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves .
Sol@@ omon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yester@@ year , among whom we coun@@ t those under King C@@ etsh@@ wayo who in 18@@ 79 def@@ e@@ ated the British army in Is@@ andl@@ wana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands .
These include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors .
While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2 ,@@ 5-@@ million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12 ,4@@ -@@ million .
Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports .
What , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit cr@@ un@@ ch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade .
and malaria cases have mas@@ sively declined .
It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Curr@@ ent Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth .
The same challenges confront the private sector .
In this regard , we should salute the late President of the African National Congress , Oliver Reg@@ inald Tambo , for initiating and pil@@ oting through continental and world bodies what became a comp@@ ass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country .
But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime .
In reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential .
Over@@ all , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes .
I stand before the people of South Africa with hum@@ ility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circum@@ stance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President .
They include Brian B@@ un@@ ting , B@@ illy N@@ air , N@@ cumisa K@@ ondlo , John G@@ om@@ omo , Joe N@@ hlanhla , C@@ as Sal@@ oojee , John Sch@@ ip@@ pers and Jan van Ec@@ k .
Nat@@ urally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers .
It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20@@ th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad@@ -@@ hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Qu@@ estion of South Africa adopted in August , 1989 commonly known as the Harare Declaration .
As such , we have been forced to t@@ one down our forec@@ asts in terms of growth and job-@@ creation .
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security ;
I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society .
Govern@@ ments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing with 2 ,@@ 6-@@ million subsidised houses provided .
We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-@@ settlement support could have been handled faster and better .
This has created the possibility mas@@ sively to expand this programme and improve its quality .
Within the gal@@ ax@@ y of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the mis@@ fortune since last February to bid the final farewell .
This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure .
Violence against women and children is much too high .
While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion .
We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries .
But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change .
to under@@ scor@@ e the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sac@@ r@@ ific@@ ed for , refusing to be c@@ owed by setbacks and hard@@ ships .
These difficulties have co@@ incid@@ ed with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high .
It is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a Constitution hardly equ@@ alled in the world .
There is no g@@ ain@@ saying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive .
And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postpon@@ ed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has eng@@ ul@@ fed the global village .
Government is pain@@ fully aware that ab@@ ject poverty is still too widespread in our society ; and the level of inequality is too high .
On both counts , the private sector is l@@ agg@@ ing far behind .
Indeed , the ro@@ bus@@ tness of our political engagement during this season of electoral cont@@ est which we all agree should be dign@@ ified and peaceful is the sur@@ est guarantee of the continued survival and deep@@ ening of our democracy .
As a consequence , some of us may be mes@@ mer@@ ised by the transi@@ ent wav@@ es of stor@@ my weather and hun@@ ch our shoulders in the face of these head@@ wind@@ s of economic tur@@ bul@@ ence and political t@@ um@@ ult .
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beginning of this last session of our Thir@@ d Democratic Parliament .
Be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption .
We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage .
But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain imm@@ ense .
Over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance .
To these , I would also like to add Ms Hel@@ en S@@ uzman , a truly distinguished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the ch@@ amb@@ ers of the old .
In this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds .
It is a matter of proud record that , for instance , femal@@ e-@@ headed households have received a bigg@@ er-@@ than@@ -@@ average share of the social wage including housing and health care ;
But I can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and I dare not ling@@ er , for my long walk is not yet ended .
95 of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility ; and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water .
These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that character@@ ise our nation .
On this we still have some way to go .
I c@@ ite these issues not because they are all-@@ encomp@@ ass@@ ing nor that by identifying them we would c@@ ure all the ills of our society .
Those fears and in@@ securities gave rise to decades of resistance .
and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come .
The global economic mel@@ t@@ down does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people .
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament , Traditional leaders ;
Within South Africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic F@@ ut@@ ure bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life .
To quote work conducted by a team of academ@@ ics at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Professor Serv@@ a@@ as van der Berg :
Among households that include children , the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically between 2002 and 2006 .
The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase ;
All kinds of statistics can be cited to att@@ est to this .
And because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes .
Within public and private institutions , the possibility of nef@@ arious schemes siph@@ oning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern
It is common cause that , after the economic stag@@ nation of the late 198@@ 0@@ s and early 199@@ 0@@ s , South Africa has experienced the long@@ est period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 19@@ 40 .
D@@ aily experience , in poor and aff@@ luent neighbourhoods alike , is one of appreh@@ ension at the possibility of violent attack .
That cour@@ ag@@ eous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 190@@ 9 of the National Convention which pres@@ aged the formation of the Union of South Africa .
Our democracy is healthy .
This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability .
Our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system .
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ;
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ;
This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant , which increased from 3@@ 4@@ -@@ thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8 ,@@ 1-@@ million in 2008 .
I have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the gl@@ or@@ ious v@@ ista that surro@@ unds me , to look back on the distance I have come .
As such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries .
All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 .
We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them .
R@@ ather , I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of v@@ isions .
In the centres of learning , the same resistance fu@@ elled the re@@ k@@ indl@@ ing of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership .
Six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to hal@@ ve unemployment and poverty by 2014 .
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement .
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections .
This is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-@@ corruption hot@@ lines .
As we look back over the past fif@@ teen years , I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in ste@@ ering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Jud@@ iciary ;
We can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the short-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ essness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis .
Of course , the overall crime rate , having pe@@ ak@@ ed in 2002 , has consistently declined .
We still have a long way to go .
Mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-@@ election administration to hit the ground running .
Firstly , mon@@ ey@@ -@@ me@@ tric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century .
Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanis@@ ed us all .
Yet , in being brut@@ ally self-@@ critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country .
And we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sover@@ eign territories .
These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-@@ cycl@@ ical fiscal policy .
and our under-@@ 20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment .
We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africas pursuit of excellence over the past year .
But beyond this , the true legacy of this spectac@@ le will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world .
In this regard , we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book .
At the same time we will improve SAD@@ Cs interaction with the Common Market of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community . These initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weak@@ en the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the Southern African Customs Union .
In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate .
We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the Kyoto Protocol and its success@@ ors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world .
but , hopefully , also with regard to political dialogue .
This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better .
In@@ forming these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ;
We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity .
There can be no justification for such acts of wan@@ ton destruction and sav@@ ag@@ ery .
In addition , we will more widely utilise the Social Distr@@ ess Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemploy@@ ment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits .
We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IB@@ SA ;
In our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path .
The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ;
G@@ in@@ iel de V@@ illiers and his team have won the Dakar R@@ ally ;
Cr@@ itically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not sc@@ aled down .
But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later .
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Ch@@ ildr@@ ens Rights F@@ ocal Po@@ ints beyond the current 60 .
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the mach@@ in@@ eries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50@@ /@@ 50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and ch@@ ildr@@ ens rights including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy , preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency ;
strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability ;
creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government , including national strategic planning ;
This rich heritage points to Africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of science and literature , philosophy and comm@@ erce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scr@@ amble for Africas wealth .
Al@@ ong with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations , the International Mon@@ etary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner .
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now .
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-@@ creation .
Now the work of reconstruction can start in ear@@ nest ;
In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country .
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , dare not ling@@ er , for long walk is not yet ended .
In this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance .
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anti@@ competitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations .
These and other programmes , including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February , form the bed@@ rock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future .
We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population .
Indeed , over the past 15 years we have spar@@ ed no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Cent@@ ury .
and to that we can attach no price !
implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country ;
We are of course Rugby World Champions ;
intensifying the campaign to save energy , so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour , while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change , resources such as fos@@ si@@ l fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing ;
and South Africa stands ready to assist wherever we can .
We are also encouraged that , whatever f@@ its and starts may seem to character@@ ise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inex@@ or@@ able .
The ab@@ iding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale , not only to st@@ em the impact of the crisis ; but also to put in place measures that would obvi@@ ate a recurr@@ ence .
We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership ; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region .
Just two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu .
Vir@@ tually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion from st@@ ad@@ ia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament .

We have on coun@@ t@@ less occasions expressed our concern at the pers@@ istence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular .
Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50@@ th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development .
We wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of Zambia , Ghana and the United States of America for elections the symbolism of which trans@@ c@@ ends the narrow boundaries of their nation@@ -@@ states .
The length of time towards att@@ aining a higher tr@@ aj@@ ec@@ tory may have been stretched somewhat .
submitting the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development to Parliament ;
The depth of our dis@@ appointment at the recent escal@@ ation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians including children , women and the elderly indeed def@@ ies description .
We are confident that , because it car@@ es , the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they bl@@ aze out along a new tr@@ ail .
It is steadily growing stronger .
We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ continent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face .
but beyond this , that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary .
Over these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership .
In the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western Sahara , C@@ te dIvoire , Somalia and elsewhere .
Ste@@ adily but surely , our continent is progressing towards her ren@@ aissance , with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders agenda , asser@@ ting her hope and her resilience on the world stage .
Both in the G@@ 20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argu@@ ed for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the crisis origin@@ ated and where it is most severe .
continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-@@ poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way ;
continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health Insurance ;
our Paralymp@@ ians continue to do us proud ;
This initiative should sp@@ ur us on to act in concer@@ t with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition .
Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilit@@ ator , former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion .
We are truly heart@@ ened that , yesterday , the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government .
This , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state .
And we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confid@@ ently gearing itself to perform above expectations !
and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays .
We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-@@ EU Summit later this year .
We are privileged that this year we conclude celebr@@ ations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China .
We believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system ;
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been for@@ ging with Russia , and countries in Asia , the Middle East , as well as L@@ atin and North America .
It is this , and this alone , that has informed our pers@@ istence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country .
Special acc@@ ol@@ ades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the ap@@ ex of global r@@ ank@@ ings .
As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action , we will pay particular attention to :
We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us .
However , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are pr@@ ud@@ ent and sustainable .

Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life the ideal of a democratic and free society , in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities . 
We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country , workers and school@@ children , can be part of the occasion . 
South African and foreign media ; 
As we celebrate Madib@@ a's release today , let us recomm@@ it ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans , black and white .

I stand before you , not as a pro@@ ph@@ et but as a humble serv@@ ant of you , the people . 
I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands . 
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full , the critical role played by the former President of the ANC , Com@@ r@@ ade Oliver Tambo , who laid the foundation for this country to become a sh@@ ining example of freedom and democracy . 
Many of those who lost their jobs were the b@@ read@@ winners in poor families . 
The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address , I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by December 2009 . 
These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation .

Comp@@ atriots and friends , 
You will off course recall that the masses of this country , in their different formations , responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid un@@ work@@ able . 
We know that these and other measures cannot fully mitigate the effects of the recession . 
Government introduced a training lay@@ -off scheme to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retren@@ chment .

Honourable Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa and all esteemed members of the Jud@@ iciary ; 
These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income , work experience and training opportunities . 
We recall the words of Madiba on his release , when he said and I qu@@ ot@@ e: 
We are pleased to announce that by the end of December , we had created more than 4@@ 80 000 public works job opportunities , which is 9@@ 7@@ % of the target we had set . 
Deputy President of the Republic , Honourable Kgalema Motlanthe ; 
In the two decades since the release of Madiba , our country has changed fundamentally . 
Harry Sch@@ war@@ z , who s@@ adly passed away last week . 
In the next three years , an additional two million children from poor families and households , aged 15 to 18 years , will benefit from the Child@@ -@@ Support Grant . 
They became a symbol of the sacrif@@ ices of many who b@@ ore the br@@ unt of apartheid . 
Your tirel@@ ess and heroic sacrif@@ ices have made it possible for me to be here today . 
They played a significant role in the process leading to the release of Madiba .

The Governor of the Reserve Bank ; 
Last year , we experienced our first recession in 17 years . 
We will also continue preparations for the establishment of a national health insurance system . 
In December 2009 , Cabinet approved a turn@@ around strategy for local government . 
Government must work faster , harder and smar@@ ter . 
Economic activity is rising in South Africa , and we expect growth going forward . 
Proposals will be tabled to subsid@@ ise the cost of h@@ iring younger workers , to encourage firms to take on in@@ experienced staff . 
We also need to integrate gender equity measures into the Government's Programme of Action . 
It will outline what is to be done , how , by whom , within what time period and using what measurements and resources . 
We are working with higher education institutions to ensure that eligible students obtain financial assistance , through the National Stud@@ ent Financial A@@ id Scheme . 
This will enable us to provide a second chance at education , for those who do not qualify for university . 
Eskom will continue to build additional generation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power stations . 
During this year of action , let us work together to make local government every@@ bod@@ y's business . 
The ministers who are responsible for a particular outcome , will sign a detailed delivery agreement with the President . 
We held a meeting with mayors and municipal managers last year . 
Unless we do this , we will not improve the quality of education . 
In addition , we will work to improve the effectiveness of local government , infrastructure development and human settlements . 
We will ensure that our rail network is reliable , competitive and better integrated with our sea ports . 
This year , 2010 , shall be a year of action . 
We will continue to improve our healthcare system . 
We are also collabor@@ ating with the D@@ B@@ SA and the Industrial Development Corporation , in a public-private partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects . 
Unemploy@@ ment rates for young people are substantially higher than the average . 
We want learners and teachers to be in school , in class , on time , learning and teaching for seven hours a day . 
A further expansion of public employment programmes is also underway . 
The defining feature of this administration will be that it knows where people live , understands their needs and responds faster . 
We need to invest in our youth to ensure a skilled and capable work@@ force to support growth and job creation . 
We will undertake a number of key activities towards the achievement of these outcomes . 
Local government must work . 
We will implement all the undertakings made on World AIDS Day relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures . 
Our education targets are simple but critical . 
Our education and skills programmes will increase our productivity and competitiveness . 
When this administration came into office last year , we undertook to work harder to build a strong developmental state . 
Our rural development programme will improve rural productivity , and the lives of people living in rural areas . 
We welcome last month@@ 's statement by the three teacher unions , NA@@ P@@ T@@ O@@ SA , SAD@@ TU and SA@@ O@@ U , re@@ affirming their commitment to the Quality Learning and Te@@ aching Campaign from the beginning of 2010 . 
We have part@@ nered with the Development Bank of Southern Africa to improve the functionality of public hospitals and their district offices .

This includes local infrastructure and tertiary projects and literacy projects , home-based care , school maintenance and early childhood development initiatives . 
Government will therefore not withdraw its support measures . 
Comp@@ atriots and esteemed guests , 
We will also reduce inf@@ ant mortality through the massive immunisation programme . 
Now is the time to lay the ground@@ work for stronger growth going forward , and for growth that gives rise to more jobs . 
This will ensure that local government has the correct management , administrative and technical skills . 
We therefore plan to increase the training of 16@@ -@@ 25 year ol@@ ds in further education and training facilities . 
We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government . 
We are working hard to ensure that everyone in South Africa feels safe and is safe . 
Over the next three years , government will spend R8@@ 46 billion on public infrastructure . 
We also visited various communities and municipalities , including Balfour in Mpumalanga and Th@@ embisa in Gauteng . 
The labour statistics released on Tuesday , show that the economy is now creating jobs rather than sh@@ ed@@ ding them . 
I have directed the ministers to attend to the outstanding matters . 
Another key outcome is to ensure a long and healthy life for all South Africans . 
We have directed law-enforcement agencies to take a t@@ ougher stance on lawlessness in Balfour and other areas .

Under@@ p@@ inning our strategy for economic recovery and growth , is our capital investment programme . 
We will expect the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this vision . 
We said it would be a state that responds to the needs and aspirations of the people , and which performs better and faster . 
We have also set amb@@ itious targets for skills development , to produce additional engineers and techn@@ icians , and to increase the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers . 
We will rein@@ state health programmes in schools . 
In addition , each of our 27 000 schools will be assessed by officials from the Department of Basic Education . 
We reiterate that there are no griev@@ ances that can justify violence and the destruction of property . 
Municipalities must improve the provision of housing , water , sanitation , electricity , waste management and roads . 
Among other things , this will look at the participation of independent power producers , and protecting the poor from rising electricity prices . 
The most urgent focus of policy change must be interventions to create jobs for young people . 
Our long-term infrastructure programme will help us grow faster . 
We all have a role to play . 
This action will ensure that women , children and persons with disabilities can access developmental opportunities . 
To students , we will provide eas@@ y-to-@@ use work@@ books in all 11 languages . 
This includes building and upgrading hospitals and clinics , and further improving the working conditions of healthcare workers . 
We will assist teachers by providing detailed daily lesson plans .

Economic indicators suggest that we are now turning the corner . 
To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy , to aid growth and development , we have established the Broad@@ -@@ Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council , chaired by the President . 
We must also increase the number of youth who enter learnerships in the private and public sectors . 
We must confront the fact that life expec@@ t@@ ancy at birth , has dropped from 60 years in 1994 to just below 50 years today . 
Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency . 
As you are aware , we are committed to five prioriti@@ es: 
Our Industrial Policy Action Plan and our new focus on green jobs , will build stronger and more labour-@@ absor@@ bing industries . 
Let us participate in community safety forums . 
We plan to set aside over 6 000 hect@@ ar@@ es of well-@@ located public land for low-income and affordable housing . 
This provided valuable insight into the challenges in local government . 
We aim to increase the pass rate for these tests from the current average of between 35 and 40@@ % to at least 60@@ % by 2014 . 
A key new initiative will be to accommodate people whose salaries are too high to get government subsidies , but who earn too little to qualify for a normal bank mortgage . 
It is too soon , though , to be certain of the pace of recovery . 
In our 2010 programme , we want to improve the ability of our children to read , write and coun@@ t in the foundation years . 
We will take further our work to reduce serious and violent crimes , and ensure that the justice system works efficiently . 
We are therefore making interventions to lower maternal mortality rates , to reduce new HIV infections and to effectively treat HIV and tuberculosis . 
From this year on@@ wards , all grade 3 , 6 and 9 students will write literacy and numeracy tests that are independently mod@@ erated . 
We aim to increase the number of matric students who are eligible for university admission to 1@@ 75 000 a year by 2014 . 
We have directed the agency to work faster to establish its structures , throughout the country , so that it can assist us to mainstream youth development programmes within government . 
We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incen@@ tiv@@ ise the private banking and housing sector , to develop new products to meet this housing demand . 
Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme , which will set the norms and standards for public servants in all spheres . 
Together with Brazil , India and China , and joined by the United States , which represented the developed world , we made a significant contribution to the accord adopted at the Cop@@ enh@@ agen Climate Change Summit in December last year . 
These are just two among many success stories . 
We therefore have to make the World Cup a huge success in his honour . 
N@@ kululeko C@@ ele , who was helped to obtain identity documents , which allowed him to en@@ rol at Tshwane University of Technology . 
As South Africa , we have voluntarily committed ourselves to specific emis@@ si@@ on-@@ reduction targets , and will continue working on our long-term climate change mitigation strategy . 
During my lif@@ etime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people . 
We need public servants who are dedicated , capable and who care for the needs of citizens . 
Ministers will provide the detail in their respective Budget V@@ ote speeches . 
It provides an opportunity to recognise the important contribution of the Indian community in the fields of labour , business , science , sport , religion , arts , culture and the achievement and consolidation of our democracy .

In@@ spir@@ ed by our ic@@ on Madiba , it is my honour to ded@@ icate this 2010 State of the Nation Address to all our heroes and heroines , sung and un@@ sung , known and unknown . 
We will support efforts to speed up the political and economic integration of the SADC region , and promote intra-@@ regional trade and investment . 
The hosting of the FIFA World Cup makes 2010 truly a year of action . 
South Africa continues to play a leading role in continental efforts to strengthen the African Union and its organs , and to work for unity . 
By 2014 , we aim to have sites in 1@@ 60 wards . 
In this regard , we launched the first pilot site of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme in G@@ iy@@ ani , Limpopo , in August last year . 
Our success in this area will be measured by the increase in the number of small-scale farmers that become economically viable . 
We require excellence and hard work . 
Since then , 2@@ 31 houses have been built . 
We have spent many years planning for this World Cup . 
We wish the LOC Chairperson , Ir@@ vin Kh@@ oza , CE@@ O D@@ anny Jordaan and Bafana Bafana coach , Car@@ los Alber@@ to Par@@ reira , all the best for the months ahead .

As we celebrate Madib@@ a's release today , we recomm@@ it ourselves to reconciliation , national unity , non-@@ rac@@ ialism and building a better future together as South Africans , black and white . 
Let us all buy tickets timeously to be able to attend the games . 
We are guided by what Madiba said in the doc@@ k , that and I qu@@ ot@@ e: 
I have cher@@ ished the ideal of a democratic and free society , in which all persons live together in harmony , and with equal opportunities . 
We only have three months to go . 
Comp@@ atriots , let us also stand behind the national team Bafana Bafana . 
We will intensify efforts to promote the interests of South Africa globally . 
And we are determined to make a success of it . 
Progress has also been made in providing infrastructure to support agricultural development , and training for community members . 
We will be putting in place measures to reduce our water loss by half by 2014 . 
In November this year , we will mark the 15@@ 0@@ th anniversary of the arrival of Indians in South Africa . 
From these and other examples , we identify weaknesses that should be rec@@ tified by various spheres of government . 
But if needs be , it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die . 
Access to health and education facilities has improved . 
Honourable members , fellow South Africans , 
Although it does not go as far as required , it is an important step forward as it commits all countries to respond to climate change .
