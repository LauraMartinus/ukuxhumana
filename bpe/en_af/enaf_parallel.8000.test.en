AN@@ TI@@ -@@ RE@@ TR@@ OV@@ IR@@ AL TR@@ E@@ A@@ T@@ MENT
The lar@@ ges@@ t treatment site is at Tygerberg Hospit@@ al, where 46@@ 4 patients are recei@@ ving treat@@ ment.
The Western Cape AR@@ V programme aims to establish 36 acc@@ redi@@ ted AR@@ V treatment sites by March 2005 and to provide da@@ ily AR@@ V treatment to 6@@ ,@@ 000 patients (@@ esti@@ m@@ ated to be hal@@ f of those in need of treat@@ ment@@ ) by March 200@@ 5.
P@@ ati@@ ents have to meet certain crit@@ eria - both medical and psy@@ cho@@ social - before they are given AR@@ V treat@@ ment.
Medi@@ cal@@ ly, the crit@@ eria are:
* World Health Organis@@ ation (@@ W@@ HO@@ ) st@@ age 4 disease (@@ except for t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ si@@ s) OR
* WH@@ O st@@ age 1, 2 and 3 and t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ sis patients with C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t WH@@ O st@@ age 1, 2 and 3 and t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ sis patients with C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t < 200 c@@ el@@ ls / m@@ m@@ Â@@ ³
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ soci@@ al@@ ly, the crit@@ eria are:
* De@@ mon@@ str@@ ated re@@ li@@ abili@@ ty, that is, atten@@ ded three or more sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led visi@@ ts to an HIV clinic@@ .
* No ac@@ tive al@@ cohol or sub@@ stance abus@@ e.
* No un@@ treated ac@@ tive de@@ pres@@ sion.
* Dis@@ clo@@ sure - it is high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded that patients either have dis@@ clo@@ sed their status to at least one f@@ ri@@ end or family member or have jo@@ in@@ ed a support group@@ .
* In@@ si@@ ght - patients need to have accep@@ ted their HIV positive stat@@ us, and have in@@ si@@ ght into the con@@ sequ@@ ences of HIV infec@@ tion and the role of AR@@ V treat@@ ment.
* A@@ bility to atten@@ d - patients must be able to atten@@ d the anti@@ -@@ retrovir@@ al centre on a regula@@ r basis (@@ transport can be arran@@ ged for patients living f@@ ar from the treatment si@@ te@@ ).
Each patient is treated in line with the standard Provincial Government of the Western Cape An@@ ti@@ -@@ retrovir@@ al Treatment Pro@@ to@@ col@@ .
The pro@@ to@@ co@@ l includes a first line of Sta@@ v@@ ud@@ ine (@@ d@@ 4@@ T@@ ), Lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine (@@ 3@@ T@@ C@@ ), E@@ fa@@ vir@@ en@@ z (@@ EF@@ Z@@ ) or Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine (N@@ V@@ P) and a second line of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine (@@ d@@ d@@ I@@ ), Z@@ id@@ o@@ v@@ ud@@ ine (@@ A@@ Z@@ T@@ ), L@@ op@@ in@@ a@@ vir / R@@ it@@ on@@ i@@ v@@ ar (L@@ P@@ V@@ /@@ r@@ ) AR@@ V treatment reg@@ i@@ men@@ .

Each tender has a number of associ@@ ated form@@ s, which must ac@@ company the tender you sub@@ mit@@ .
The specific forms you require for your tender should be listed in the tender docu@@ ment@@ ation.
You should consi@@ der very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly how you fill in these form@@ s.

1. N@@ ATION@@ AL AND PROVINCIAL TEN@@ DER FORM@@ S OR BI@@ D DO@@ C@@ U@@ MENTS
Each tender or bi@@ d has a number of associ@@ ated form@@ s, which must ac@@ company the tender or bi@@ d you sub@@ mit@@ .
These used to be kno@@ wn as '@@ tender form@@ s@@ ' and are now called '@@ bi@@ d docu@@ ments@@ '@@ .
These bi@@ d documents have the pre@@ fi@@ x S@@ B@@ D and WC@@ B@@ D for national and provincial bi@@ d documents respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
The forms usually required for national and provincial ten@@ ders (@@ except Provincial con@@ struction ten@@ der@@ s) are the follow@@ ing:
In this document you ag@@ ree to be b@@ ound by the tender or bi@@ d terms and condi@@ tions.
Your tax@@ es must be in order to be a success@@ ful with your tender or b@@ id@@ .
This document has an '@@ Application for tax clear@@ ance certific@@ ate@@ ' form att@@ ached to it.
You have to complete this form and hand it in at your nearest South Eng@@ ic@@ an Revenue Services (@@ SAR@@ S) offic@@ e, to get a tax clear@@ ance certific@@ ate.
You must then att@@ ach the origin@@ al tax clear@@ ance certificate that you get from SAR@@ S, to the tender or bi@@ d docu@@ ments.
This certificate serv@@ es as proof that you are not in ar@@ re@@ ars with your tax pay@@ ments.
Wh@@ ic@@ h of these documents you complete depend@@ s on the subject of the ten@@ der.
In this form@@ , you mo@@ tiv@@ ate your p@@ ric@@ e, by descri@@ b@@ ing the product you will supp@@ ly or the experi@@ ence of the person who will perform the servic@@ e.
This is the document in which you dec@@ l@@ are whether or not you have a rel@@ ation@@ ship (@@ f@@ ri@@ end@@ , fam@@ il@@ y, busin@@ ess@@ ) with anyone who works for government.
This is so that those people are not involved in awar@@ ding the tender in any wa@@ y, to a@@ vo@@ id cor@@ rup@@ tion.
Any contract having an im@@ ported content equi@@ val@@ ent to or ex@@ ce@@ eding US@@ $ 10 million has an indus@@ trial participation (I@@ P) oblig@@ ation, which must be addres@@ sed in the ten@@ der.
You must fill in the S@@ B@@ D 6@@ .@@ 1 form for provincial ten@@ ders even if you are not cla@@ im@@ ing any of the pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts.
If you are cla@@ im@@ ing pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts, you need to fill in those of 12 documents S@@ B@@ D /@@ WC@@ B@@ D 6@@ .@@ 1-@@ 6@@ .@@ 12 which rela@@ te to kin@@ ds of poin@@ ts you are cla@@ im@@ ing (@@ national and provin@@ ci@@ al@@ ) as ex@@ plain@@ ed abo@@ v@@ e.
This is the contract that bin@@ ds the parties should the tender be success@@ ful@@ .
There is a different form for pur@@ ch@@ ases (@@ 7@@ .@@ 1, services 7@@ .@@ 2 or sal@@ es 7@@ .@@ 3@@ )
There may be other forms to fill in for a specific tender or b@@ id@@ .
These should be inclu@@ ded with the tender or bi@@ d documents that you recei@@ v@@ e.
However, a ty@@ p@@ ical tender or bi@@ d p@@ ack@@ age will pro@@ bab@@ ly have the following docu@@ ments@@ :

2. WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL CON@@ STR@@ UC@@ TION TEN@@ DER FORM@@ S
For provincial con@@ struc@@ tion@@ -@@ related ten@@ ders the us@@ ual forms are a li@@ tt@@ le differ@@ ent@@ ; new con@@ struction "@@ b@@ id@@ " forms are also in the process of being developed in 2004@@ :

* Pre@@ fer@@ ence certificate WC@@ B@@ D@@ 6@@ .@@ 1.
Ag@@ ain@@ , there may be additional forms to comple@@ te, which will be inclu@@ ded with the tender docu@@ ments.
3. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TEN@@ DER OR BI@@ D FORM@@ S
At local level@@ , each council may have its own form@@ s, which you should en@@ qui@@ re about direc@@ t@@ ly.
HOW TEN@@ D@@ ERS OR B@@ ID@@ S ARE A@@ W@@ AR@@ DE@@ D
The document S@@ B@@ D / WC@@ B@@ D 6@@ .@@ 1 ex@@ plain@@ s how ten@@ ders or b@@ ids are deci@@ de@@ d.
WC@@ B@@ D sa@@ y@@ s:
* The b@@ id@@ der ob@@ taining the high@@ est number of poin@@ ts will be awar@@ ded the contrac@@ t.
* Pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts shall be cal@@ cu@@ lated after p@@ ric@@ es have been b@@ rou@@ ght to a com@@ par@@ ative basi@@ s.
* Po@@ in@@ ts s@@ cor@@ ed will be ro@@ un@@ ded off to 2 deci@@ mal pla@@ ces.
For example, if you have not indic@@ ated a p@@ ric@@ e, your tender will be dis@@ quali@@ fi@@ ed.
S@@ m@@ all@@ er mis@@ takes or om@@ is@@ sions may or may not dis@@ quali@@ fy you from the tender process@@ ; this is a ques@@ tion of inter@@ p@@ ret@@ ation of the tender r@@ ul@@ es.
For example, if the rules sa@@ y "@@ may dis@@ quali@@ f@@ y@@ " ra@@ ther than "@@ must dis@@ quali@@ f@@ y@@ " for a specific mis@@ tak@@ e, it is up to the official do@@ ing the check to decide whether the mis@@ take is important en@@ ough to this tender to dis@@ quali@@ fy you.
The next phase loo@@ ks at compli@@ ance of the product or services with the speci@@ fic@@ ations, and p@@ ric@@ e.
Th@@ o@@ se which do not comply with the speci@@ fic@@ ations are removed from the li@@ st@@ , while all the ten@@ ders which comply with the speci@@ fic@@ ations are listed in order of p@@ ric@@ e.
Th@@ o@@ se that f@@ all in the low@@ est p@@ ric@@ e group are then considered in a low@@ est p@@ ric@@ e tender li@@ st@@ .
It is in this phase that the pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts come into pla@@ y.
All the pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts cla@@ im@@ ed by those on the list of low@@ est p@@ ric@@ e ten@@ ders are first veri@@ fi@@ ed.
Th@@ en the form@@ ula is app@@ lied to determine who of those on the low@@ est p@@ ric@@ e list with veri@@ fi@@ able poin@@ ts come out with the best result on poin@@ ts, and therefore who should be awar@@ ded the contrac@@ t.
In other word@@ s, pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts only come into pla@@ y after the most exp@@ ensive ten@@ ders have first been exclu@@ de@@ d.
This is to ensure that the most exp@@ ensive op@@ tions do not w@@ in sol@@ ely on poin@@ ts, and also to spe@@ ed up the proc@@ ess, as only those on the low@@ est p@@ ric@@ e list have their pre@@ fer@@ ence poin@@ ts veri@@ fi@@ ed.
The Ten@@ der B@@ ul@@ le@@ ti@@ n sho@@ ws who has w@@ on previous ten@@ der@@ s, li@@ sting the p@@ ric@@ e and other fac@@ tors taken into account in awar@@ ding the ten@@ der.

How Do I Tel@@ l my D@@ au@@ gh@@ ter of my HIV Stat@@ us@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : M@@ y f@@ ri@@ end was diagno@@ sed with HIV 8@@ y@@ rs ag@@ o and is star@@ ting to get si@@ ck no@@ w@@ .
S@@ he@@ 's a single parent and is wor@@ ri@@ ed about who will take care of her 12 y@@ r old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter when she di@@ es.
S@@ he has asked me to take care of her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter, and I will do so@@ .
The proble@@ m is that she does not know how to tel@@ l her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter she is HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
Is there any@@ thing I can do to help her@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : The important thing for your f@@ ri@@ end to know is that there is pl@@ en@@ ty of time to th@@ ink about and plan what needs to be don@@ e.
One of the har@@ d@@ est th@@ ings HIV positive parents have to do is to tel@@ l their children they have the HIV vir@@ us.
O@@ f@@ ten they may be to@@ o af@@ r@@ aid to t@@ alk to their childr@@ en.
B@@ ut this si@@ l@@ ence can be b@@ ad for ever@@ y@@ on@@ e.
Children wor@@ ry when they see that s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing is w@@ r@@ ong and may bla@@ me them@@ sel@@ ves for their par@@ ent@@ 's si@@ ck@@ ness or wor@@ ri@@ es.
They need to make the most of their time toge@@ th@@ er.
It is not an e@@ as@@ y thing for parents to tel@@ l their children that they are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
Children may experi@@ ence the same fe@@ elings that the parents f@@ el@@ t when they first found out that they were HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
For example, they may have f@@ el@@ t s@@ car@@ ed, an@@ gr@@ y or s@@ ad@@ .
It should be re@@ m@@ em@@ ber@@ ed that these fe@@ elings are norm@@ al.
S@@ he needs to be given all the correc@@ t information about HIV and AID@@ S. (@@ c@@ ) Your f@@ ri@@ end needs to be s@@ ensi@@ tive to her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter@@ 's fe@@ elings and encour@@ age her to t@@ alk about how she fe@@ els and especially her f@@ ear@@ s about HIV and AID@@ S.
It would also be important for your f@@ ri@@ end to ask another family m@@ em@@ ber@@ /@@ s (@@ whom she had already to@@ ld previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ ) to be present after she dis@@ clo@@ ses her HIV status to her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter, to give her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter a s@@ ense of who she is.
Your being there to offer support at this time would be goo@@ d, as this would help to establish a b@@ ond between you and her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter.
Al@@ low@@ ing the young gi@@ r@@ l to share her fe@@ elings about her mo@@ ther@@ 's HIV status with you would help her to fe@@ el sup@@ por@@ ted.
This may make it e@@ asi@@ er for her to spe@@ ak to you and the other family members about her mother after she has di@@ ed.
S@@ he would need a lo@@ t of support now and especially at the time of her mo@@ ther@@ 's de@@ ath@@ .
Support for her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter would also give your f@@ ri@@ end pe@@ ace of min@@ d.
It may be us@@ ef@@ ul for your f@@ ri@@ end and her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter to establish a family tradi@@ tion, s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing that they would en@@ jo@@ y do@@ ing on a regula@@ r basi@@ s.
This could take place once a week per@@ h@@ ap@@ s.
A@@ no@@ ther way to create a record of important m@@ em@@ or@@ ies could be to for them to make a m@@ em@@ ory box@@ .
Your f@@ ri@@ end could also w@@ ri@@ te a letter to her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter telling her how much she lo@@ ves her and ad@@ ding this to the m@@ em@@ ory bo@@ x to be op@@ ened after her de@@ ath@@ .
The da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter would pro@@ bab@@ ly find much com@@ for@@ t in having s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing tan@@ gi@@ ble to re@@ min@@ d her of her mother and the lo@@ ve they shar@@ ed for each oth@@ er.
Bo@@ th your f@@ ri@@ end and her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter need a gre@@ at deal of support at this ti@@ me, they are for@@ t@@ un@@ ate that you are prepar@@ ed to be there as a support b@@ ase for them during this diffic@@ ult period in their li@@ v@@ es.

Can I In@@ si@@ st Th@@ at S@@ ome@@ one H@@ as an HIV T@@ est before O@@ ff@@ ering Th@@ em a J@@ ob@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I am going to start work next month and have arran@@ ged for a domestic worker to do the hou@@ se@@ work and l@@ ook after my children aged 2 and 4.
I want her to have a bl@@ ood test before she star@@ ts work because I am wor@@ ri@@ ed that she mi@@ ght have HIV and my children could get infec@@ ted.
How do I go about making sure she gets tes@@ te@@ d@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : E@@ ven if a person tes@@ ts HIV neg@@ ative before they start work@@ , it is possible that they mi@@ ght become infected some@@ time in the fu@@ ture.
In South Africa it is il@@ legal to in@@ si@@ st that someone have an HIV test before off@@ ering them a j@@ ob@@ .
It is also il@@ legal to dis@@ mis@@ s anyone j@@ ust because they are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
E@@ ven if a person who is employed deci@@ des to have an HIV tes@@ t, they are not leg@@ ally b@@ ound to inform their employer of the res@@ ult@@ .
S@@ hould they do so@@ , the employer is o@@ bli@@ ged to ke@@ ep this information conf@@ identi@@ al.
An@@ yone who deci@@ des to be tes@@ ted must receive counselling both before and after the test is don@@ e.
The person must also sign an inform@@ ed consent form before bl@@ ood can be taken for the test@@ .
In practi@@ cal terms this means that@@ , before the test is don@@ e, the person will receive education about HIV/@@ AID@@ S, disc@@ us@@ s the risk of testing positive and ex@@ pl@@ ore how they th@@ ink they mi@@ ght cop@@ e with either a positive or neg@@ ative res@@ ult@@ .
The counsel@@ l@@ or will determine wh@@ y the person needs to be tes@@ ted and inform hi@@ m@@ /@@ her of their legal righ@@ ts.
S@@ hould the person test HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e, the counsel@@ l@@ or will ex@@ pl@@ ore how they can prevent trans@@ mission or the virus to oth@@ ers.
Human rights ab@@ uses have happ@@ ened when employees were taken for bl@@ ood tes@@ ts, by their employ@@ ers and without inform@@ ed consent having been ob@@ tain@@ ed.
This constitu@@ tes an ass@@ a@@ ult@@ .
F@@ ur@@ th@@ er, any health care worker who inform@@ s an employer of the employ@@ ee@@ 's HIV stat@@ us, without that person@@ 's cons@@ ent, would be g@@ uil@@ ty of the serious off@@ ence of bre@@ ach@@ ing conf@@ identi@@ ali@@ ty.
M@@ any people are concerned about be@@ com@@ ing infected with HIV them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, or about possible ris@@ ks to their childr@@ en.
However, it is important to re@@ member that HIV is not spread through cas@@ ual contac@@ t.
If this were the case al@@ most all of us would be positive by now as we are con@@ stan@@ tly in contact with infected peop@@ le.
HIV is spread in three way@@ s:
* un@@ protec@@ ted se@@ x with an infected person
* an HIV positive mother mi@@ ght infec@@ t her child during pregn@@ anc@@ y, labour or bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding
* ex@@ pos@@ ure to bl@@ ood infected with HIV@@ .
South Africa has one of the saf@@ est bl@@ ood trans@@ fu@@ sion services in the wor@@ l@@ d.
F@@ ur@@ th@@ er, we sel@@ d@@ om come into contact with other peop@@ le@@ 's bloo@@ d.
The best way of preven@@ ting the spread of this disease is to arm y@@ our@@ self with knowledge and act accord@@ ing@@ ly.
Some domestic workers who have tes@@ ted HIV positive have been in the for@@ t@@ un@@ ate position of being able to con@@ fi@@ de in their employ@@ ers and receive sup@@ por@@ t.
These employ@@ ers recogn@@ ise that people with HIV are also bre@@ ad@@ win@@ ners and that it is the quality of their work@@ , ra@@ ther than their HIV status that is import@@ an@@ t.

How Do I C@@ ome To Ter@@ ms with an AIDS De@@ ath@@ ?
I fe@@ el so b@@ ad@@ ly about it all@@ .
Wh@@ y di@@ d she not tel@@ l me@@ ?
What can I do@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : Your s@@ ad@@ ness at the death of your best f@@ ri@@ end is evid@@ ent.
One of the har@@ d@@ est th@@ ings in life is to lo@@ se a de@@ ar f@@ ri@@ end@@ , especially when there is un@@ fin@@ is@@ hed business between you.
HIV Inf@@ ec@@ tion has cre@@ ated a situ@@ ation of distr@@ ust@@ , some@@ times even in the clo@@ s@@ est rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
One of the reasons for this has been the ter@@ ri@@ ble stig@@ ma associ@@ ated with this ill@@ n@@ ess.
It is this stig@@ ma that has caused people with HIV and AIDS not to share the knowledge of their status with oth@@ ers, even those nearest and de@@ ar@@ est@@ .
Rec@@ ei@@ ving an HIV positive result in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably ca@@ uses a cri@@ sis for the person being to@@ ld such new@@ s.
Reg@@ ard@@ less of how good the counselling is that one recei@@ v@@ es, we should ne@@ ver under@@ esti@@ mate the se@@ ver@@ ity of the sho@@ ck a person fe@@ els up@@ on being to@@ ld that the HIV test result is posi@@ tiv@@ e.
The Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or h@@ ers@@ el@@ f or hi@@ m@@ self is not un@@ affected by the result s@@ /@@ he has to gi@@ v@@ e.
The Coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ s one me@@ ets at the Community Health Centres have received very inten@@ sive and specific counselling training which en@@ ab@@ les them to do the work that they do@@ .
M@@ any of them have been counselling for a long time and are very experi@@ enc@@ ed.
They are able to provide the necessary comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate support and accur@@ ate information in order to ob@@ tain inform@@ ed consent from their clients pri@@ or to the test being don@@ e, and to cont@@ ain the person@@ 's emo@@ tions once the result is kno@@ wn@@ .
It is of the ut@@ most import@@ ance that people should ne@@ ver ag@@ ree to an HIV test without first recei@@ ving the necessary P@@ re and Po@@ st T@@ est Coun@@ selling from a train@@ ed counsel@@ lor@@ .
It is by way of the above ex@@ plan@@ ation that I h@@ ope to re@@ ass@@ ure you that while your f@@ ri@@ end may have ch@@ os@@ en not to con@@ fi@@ de her HIV positive status to you@@ , she would have received the best possible support during counselling and test@@ ing.
Whi@@ le I do not wish to minim@@ ise the inten@@ si@@ ty of your pa@@ in and bew@@ il@@ der@@ ment at the f@@ act that your f@@ ri@@ end di@@ ed of AIDS related comp@@ lic@@ ations without di@@ vul@@ ging her HIV status to you@@ , I would like to ex@@ pla@@ in what happ@@ ens to a person when s@@ /@@ he recei@@ ves an HIV positive res@@ ult@@ .
A positive diagno@@ sis gener@@ ates de@@ ep emo@@ tions within the person recei@@ ving the res@@ ult@@ .
The cri@@ sis gener@@ ated from this experi@@ ence could last for many weeks while the person concerned comes to terms with the ne@@ ws and works through the fe@@ elings and possible con@@ sequ@@ ences of what being HIV positive means in terms of on@@ e@@ 's self@@ , on@@ e@@ 's lo@@ ved on@@ es (@@ family and f@@ ri@@ end@@ s) and oth@@ ers.
When one is given a positive result one go@@ es into sho@@ ck because it can be the most de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating experi@@ ence ever@@ .
O@@ f@@ ten the sho@@ ck is so gre@@ at that af@@ ter@@ war@@ d@@ s, all the person re@@ members is that s@@ /@@ he is HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
A@@ no@@ ther de@@ ep emo@@ tion that comes to the fore is f@@ ear@@ .
Fe@@ ar of what mi@@ ght happ@@ en to on@@ e, fe@@ ar of the fu@@ ture@@ , fe@@ ar of re@@ jec@@ tion by fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ri@@ end@@ s, fe@@ ar of ca@@ using h@@ ur@@ t to on@@ e@@ 's lo@@ ved on@@ es by im@@ par@@ ting the ne@@ ws to them@@ .
Spe@@ ak@@ ing from many years of experi@@ ence as a Coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ , I have y@@ et to meet a cli@@ ent who at some st@@ age does not th@@ ink about the effect that bre@@ ak@@ ing the ne@@ ws of h@@ is@@ /@@ her HIV positive status will have on lo@@ ved on@@ es and what the con@@ sequ@@ ences mi@@ ght be@@ .
An@@ ger@@ , dis@@ appointment and some@@ times g@@ uil@@ t often pla@@ y maj@@ or ro@@ les in the kind of deci@@ sions people make around inform@@ ing lo@@ ved on@@ es.
These fe@@ elings are often direc@@ ted at self@@ .
A@@ ga@@ in it is important for the person to disc@@ us@@ s these fe@@ elings in a safe and sup@@ por@@ tive environ@@ ment.
The people living with HIV are vul@@ ner@@ ab@@ le, both physi@@ cally and emo@@ tion@@ al@@ ly.
They some@@ times choo@@ se to share their vul@@ ner@@ ability with a train@@ ed counsel@@ lor@@ , ra@@ ther than with close family or f@@ ri@@ ends because to do so would be to@@ o over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing.
It is h@@ ard to be str@@ ong for lo@@ ved on@@ es when one is fe@@ eling fr@@ ag@@ i@@ le.
S@@ o people may choo@@ se to share their concer@@ ns and issues with a counsel@@ lor@@ , where they are as@@ su@@ red of a safe pla@@ ce@@ ; the sp@@ ace to ven@@ ti@@ late fe@@ elings without reserv@@ ation@@ ; where neg@@ ative and positive fe@@ elings will be contain@@ ed with respec@@ t, a non-@@ jud@@ g@@ mental at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de and un@@ condi@@ tional comp@@ as@@ sion.
One of the gre@@ at@@ est f@@ ear@@ s people have is that they will lo@@ se the necessary support b@@ ase provided by family and f@@ ri@@ end@@ s.
The th@@ re@@ at of this support being je@@ o@@ par@@ d@@ -@@ is@@ ed, often d@@ riv@@ es people to ke@@ ep si@@ l@@ ent about their HIV stat@@ us.

S@@ he to@@ ld me that her Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or said that ever@@ y@@ body who takes these dr@@ ug@@ s al@@ ways have to use con@@ dom@@ s.
Wh@@ y@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : What your si@@ ster to@@ ld you is tr@@ u@@ e.
If you do not al@@ ways use a con@@ d@@ om correc@@ t@@ ly, you stand the ch@@ ance of developing dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant str@@ ain@@ s of HIV@@ .
This means that the dr@@ ug@@ s will not work any@@ more against the vir@@ us.
The vir@@ al load will increase and the C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ el@@ ls (@@ wh@@ i@@ te c@@ ell@@ s) which is our immun@@ e syste@@ m, will start to dro@@ p.
This situ@@ ation will le@@ ad to a dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant str@@ ain and the virus will manage to produce more of it@@ self@@ .
If this happ@@ en@@ ed, the dr@@ ug@@ s would be in@@ effec@@ tiv@@ e.
The res@@ is@@ tant str@@ ain would then become str@@ on@@ ger and multi@@ p@@ ly in the bo@@ d@@ y.
Res@@ is@@ t@@ ance to one dr@@ ug (@@ because of not using con@@ dom@@ s) could also prevent other cla@@ s@@ ses of dr@@ ug@@ s from work@@ ing.
If you do not comm@@ it y@@ our@@ self to use con@@ d@@ oms consist@@ ently and correc@@ t@@ ly, you could infec@@ t those peop@@ le, with whom you have un@@ protec@@ ted p@@ ene@@ tr@@ ative s@@ ex@@ , with this dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant str@@ ain of the vir@@ us.
Th@@ at means that those people whom you may have infec@@ ted, will not be able to take those dr@@ ug@@ s at the time that they are ready to do so@@ , even th@@ ough they have not taken AR@@ V@@ s be@@ for@@ e, because they star@@ ted out with dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant str@@ ain@@ s.
When someone is ready to start AR@@ V ther@@ ap@@ y, it is necessary for that person to go to the AR@@ V clinic to see the doc@@ tor@@ , who after assessment will decide whether the person@@ 's health war@@ ran@@ ts An@@ ti@@ retrovir@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y.
The doctor will then ref@@ er the person to the Coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ .
The Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or will sp@@ end time with that person in private and ex@@ pla@@ in ever@@ y@@ thing concerning the AR@@ V dr@@ ug@@ s, such as@@ , ad@@ her@@ ence, di@@ et, living a positive li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le et@@ c. The Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or will also an@@ sw@@ er all ques@@ tions that the cli@@ ent may have concerning AR@@ V ther@@ ap@@ y.
It will also be necess@@ ary, there@@ af@@ ter, for the person to atten@@ d group@@ s ses@@ sions as advis@@ ed by the Coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ .
This does not me@@ an that you will be required to disc@@ us@@ s your personal issues in the pres@@ ence of other peop@@ le, but it en@@ ab@@ les you to lear@@ n about many issues around AR@@ V@@ s in a safe environ@@ ment.
F@@ ol@@ low@@ ing the group ses@@ sion@@ s, there will also be other individual (@@ fac@@ e to fac@@ e) counselling opportunities with the Coun@@ sel@@ lor@@ , where personal issues and diffic@@ ul@@ ties regarding AR@@ V@@ s may be disc@@ uss@@ ed in priv@@ ate.
In between these various ses@@ sion@@ s, a cli@@ ent is free to contact the Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or should problems ar@@ is@@ e, whether those problems have to do with such issues as con@@ d@@ om use or any@@ thing el@@ se related to AR@@ V@@ s.
W@@ he@@ ther you are ready to be star@@ ted on AR@@ V dr@@ ug@@ s, or no@@ t, it is necessary for you to be commit@@ ted to the consistent use of con@@ dom@@ s.

What Advice and Coun@@ selling on HIV and AIDS are A@@ v@@ aila@@ ble for Small And Medium Si@@ z@@ ed B@@ usin@@ ess@@ es@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I r@@ un a s@@ mal@@ lis@@ h business with only eigh@@ teen employ@@ e@@ es.
I ke@@ ep he@@ aring about the effect of HIV/AIDS on business but I have no ide@@ a what I should be do@@ ing about it.
In any case all my staff appe@@ ar to be in good health@@ .
What advice can you give me@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : If you have eigh@@ teen employ@@ e@@ es, statisti@@ cs su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that there may be three or four infected with the H@@ I vir@@ us.
If infected employees are in an early st@@ age of the illness they are un@@ li@@ kel@@ y to be sho@@ wing any sign@@ s of infec@@ tion as y@@ et.
However, if they are i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant of their status and are therefore not acting appropri@@ ate@@ ly, you may find in a year or tw@@ o@@ , that se@@ veral of your key workers become ill at more or less the same time.
For this and other important reasons it is very desi@@ r@@ able that all your staff are provided with HIV information and are given the opportun@@ ity to be volun@@ tar@@ ily counsel@@ led and tes@@ ted to establish whether they are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
It is against the law for any company to test employees without volun@@ tary inform@@ ed consent (@@ 1) practice pre@@ -@@ employment testing or
(@@ 2) to test existing employees without their inform@@ ed consent (@@ volun@@ tary agreement to be tes@@ ted after appropriate pre@@ -@@ test counsel@@ ling@@ ).
H@@ av@@ ing said that@@ , you do need inform@@ ed advice as to how to go about encour@@ aging your staff to access volun@@ tary counselling and test@@ ing.
To begin with it must be rec@@ ogni@@ z@@ ed that staff have the right to full conf@@ identi@@ ality about their stat@@ us.
In other word@@ s, even if they test posi@@ tiv@@ e, they are not under any oblig@@ ation to dis@@ close this to you.
O@@ f@@ ten the best way to begin is to ask a quali@@ fied person to meet with you so that you can together ag@@ ree on a HIV Work@@ place Policy which includes an education strategy sui@@ ted to the particular needs of your busin@@ ess.
The Work@@ place policy needs to be form@@ ula@@ ted by a t@@ ask group which is fully represent@@ ative in terms of the man@@ age@@ ment, work@@ ers, sho@@ p ste@@ wards and uni@@ on represent@@ ativ@@ es.
The next ste@@ p mi@@ ght be for you to access ex@@ per@@ ts who could imple@@ ment your HIV/AIDS information education for your work@@ force out@@ lin@@ ing the main issues involved in HIV counselling and test@@ ing.
The purpose of this is to inform and to correc@@ t mis@@ information wh@@ il@@ st encour@@ aging individu@@ als to s@@ cr@@ ut@@ in@@ iz@@ e their own at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our in order to make an inform@@ ed decision as to whether or not they should take an HIV test@@ .
You need to be qui@@ te c@@ le@@ ar as to what your policy is with regard to HIV positive staff who are at all st@@ ages of the infec@@ tion and the imp@@ lic@@ ations for other staff members and the compan@@ y.
The aims of an HIV/AIDS programme should include minim@@ ising the risk of infec@@ tion as well as ke@@ eping already infected staff in a state of good health@@ .
Leg@@ al@@ ly, employees may not have their services termin@@ ated j@@ ust because they are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
As long as they are fit en@@ ough to car@@ ry out their duties they are entitled to remain in employ@@ ment.
On@@ ly if they are in an advan@@ ced st@@ age of illness which is affec@@ ting them se@@ ver@@ ely may it be j@@ usti@@ fied to bo@@ ard them on groun@@ ds of inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ ity and at that st@@ age they would be entitled to the normal agre@@ ed benefit@@ s.
Al@@ so staff may not ref@@ use to work together with staff members who have dis@@ clo@@ sed their HIV positive stat@@ us.
Sp@@ ace allow@@ s us to deal with only some of the issues invol@@ v@@ ed.
For fu@@ ture help we su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that you contact one of the organ@@ iz@@ ations which offer advice and counselling for small and medi@@ um siz@@ ed busin@@ ess@@ es.

An@@ s@@ wer@@ : If your sexual part@@ ner agre@@ es to ac@@ company you and also agre@@ es to be tes@@ ted, this is usually the best sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ .
One of the maj@@ or go@@ als of volun@@ tary counselling and testing (@@ V@@ C@@ T) is the pre@@ vention of HIV infec@@ tion through be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our chan@@ ge.
Wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de research has sho@@ wn that when both part@@ ners are tes@@ ted at the same ti@@ me, the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of main@@ taining an HIV neg@@ ative status is gre@@ at@@ ly increas@@ ed.
One of the reasons for this is that by testing together you are de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating to each other your commit@@ ment to each other@@ 's well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
E@@ ss@@ enti@@ ally you are br@@ ing@@ ing into the open the issue of trust and of being able to re@@ ly on each other not to je@@ o@@ par@@ di@@ z@@ e the health of the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p.
This does not me@@ an ho@@ wever, that the part@@ ners are counsel@@ led toge@@ th@@ er.
On the con@@ tr@@ ary it is important that people be counsel@@ led separ@@ ately before taking the test to en@@ able a com@@ prehensive assessment to be made of the uni@@ qu@@ e risk fac@@ tors applicable to each individu@@ al.
This disc@@ us@@ sion is k@@ ept tot@@ ally conf@@ identi@@ al .
Res@@ ults are also given individu@@ ally to en@@ able people who are found to be HIV positive to decide how best to handle this knowle@@ d@@ ge.
At ATI@@ CC people are given the opportun@@ ity, should they so wis@@ h@@ , to disc@@ us@@ s their results mu@@ tu@@ ally in the pres@@ ence of their counsel@@ lor@@ (@@ s@@ ).
This en@@ ab@@ les part@@ ners to ex@@ pl@@ ore fu@@ ture pre@@ vention strateg@@ ies and other important issues such as trust@@ .
S@@ ome@@ times only one part@@ ner tes@@ ts posi@@ tiv@@ e.
Su@@ ch rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps are referred to as HIV@@ - disc@@ ord@@ an@@ t.
In such cases additional tes@@ ts mi@@ ght be necessary to as@@ certain whether the part@@ ner testing neg@@ ative is in the period during which the infec@@ tion cannot y@@ et be de@@ tec@@ ted (@@ i@@ e. the "@@ win@@ do@@ w perio@@ d@@ "@@ ).
On@@ -@@ going c@@ ou@@ p@@ le counselling is hel@@ p@@ ful during this time of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty.
C@@ lear@@ ly when both part@@ ners test posi@@ tiv@@ e, on-@@ going c@@ ou@@ p@@ le counselling is also benef@@ ici@@ al in assi@@ sting the them to come to terms with their situ@@ ation.
There are a number of possible situ@@ ations ho@@ wever, in which it mi@@ ght be advis@@ able to come for V@@ C@@ T by y@@ our@@ self@@ .
These usually ar@@ ise from rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps in which there is a meas@@ ure of m@@ istr@@ ust@@ , poor communication and/or potential for abuse or viol@@ ence.
Of course there is also the situ@@ ation where a rel@@ ation@@ ship has j@@ ust en@@ de@@ d, but it should be re@@ m@@ em@@ ber@@ ed that it is necessary to w@@ ai@@ t for three months after the ac@@ tive sexual rel@@ ation@@ ship has en@@ ded before pres@@ enting for a test@@ .
A@@ no@@ ther one of the advan@@ t@@ ages of both part@@ ners pres@@ enting sim@@ ult@@ an@@ e@@ ously is that if they have had a mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous rel@@ ation@@ ship with each other for a minimum of three months the "@@ win@@ do@@ w perio@@ d@@ " proble@@ m f@@ al@@ ls a@@ way if they both test neg@@ ativ@@ e.

How W@@ ill the Govern@@ ment's AR@@ V Programme Wor@@ k and Where Can I G@@ et These Dr@@ ug@@ s@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I have he@@ ard that government will be providing HIV positive people with anti@@ retrovir@@ als (@@ AR@@ V@@ '@@ s) in the ne@@ ar fu@@ ture.
I would like to know about how the AR@@ V programme will work so that I can also get these dr@@ ug@@ s.
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : You are right in sa@@ ying that AR@@ V@@ 's will be public@@ ly availa@@ ble@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver not all HIV positive people will need to be on AR@@ V treat@@ ment.
AR@@ V ther@@ ap@@ y hel@@ ps people living with HIV to live a longer and health@@ ier life by low@@ ering the amount of virus in the body (@@ vir@@ al lo@@ ad@@ ) there@@ by en@@ ab@@ ling the immun@@ e system to get str@@ ong again@@ .
In South Africa about 5 million people have already been infected with the H@@ I virus (@@ 1 in every 9 peop@@ le@@ ) but only about 500 000 people need to take AR@@ V@@ 's because the rest are still health@@ y.
The only time HIV positive people will need to go on@@ to AR@@ V@@ 's is if they have a C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t below 200 (C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t is the test that sho@@ ws how str@@ ong the immun@@ e system is@@ ) or an AIDS defin@@ ing illness (@@ e.g. ex@@ tre@@ me weight los@@ s, men@@ ing@@ iti@@ s, p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ i@@ a, de@@ men@@ ti@@ a, ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ul@@ mon@@ y TB, canc@@ ers, fun@@ g@@ al and par@@ asi@@ tic infec@@ tion@@ s@@ ).
Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore you would need to have met one of these two crit@@ eria before you would quali@@ fy for AR@@ V ther@@ ap@@ y.
The Western Cape plan@@ ned to have 19 sites for the AR@@ V ro@@ ll out by April 2004 and a further 14 sites star@@ ting later in the year@@ , which gi@@ ves a total of 33 sites where one could become part of the AR@@ V programme.
The AR@@ V programme will work as follow@@ s:
C@@ li@@ ents will be referred to the programme when their C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ ts are below 200 or if they are diagno@@ sed with an AIDS defin@@ ing ill@@ n@@ ess.
F@@ ur@@ ther crit@@ eria to be met include:
The cli@@ ent must be commit@@ ted to taking AR@@ V tri@@ p@@ le ther@@ ap@@ y (@@ com@@ bin@@ ation of 3 dr@@ ug@@ s tak@@ en@@ ) for lif@@ e.
Dis@@ clo@@ sing to someone who will be a treatment "@@ bud@@ d@@ y@@ ' or assi@@ st@@ ant for the cli@@ ent to ensure ad@@ her@@ ence.
This is import@@ an@@ t, as having to take many dr@@ ug@@ s at the same time of da@@ y, every day of for the rest of your life is not e@@ as@@ y to ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ h without hel@@ p.
The cli@@ ent needs to be ad@@ her@@ ent to ensure that they have en@@ ough of the dr@@ ug in their body to make sure they do not become dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tan@@ t.
Mak@@ ing sure that the cli@@ ent does not abuse sub@@ st@@ anc@@ es, especially al@@ co@@ hol@@ .
The reas@@ on for this is to ensure that the person does not suff@@ er from li@@ ver tox@@ ic@@ ity.
In addi@@ tion to which it will be very diffic@@ ult to be compli@@ ant to treatment when under the inf@@ lu@@ ence of a sub@@ st@@ anc@@ e.
The cli@@ ent is also encour@@ aged to fol@@ low a health@@ y li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le and is made aw@@ are of the d@@ ang@@ ers of dr@@ ug inter@@ ac@@ tions.
ens@@ uring that the person will be able to atten@@ d 3 information ses@@ sions and 2 individual counselling ses@@ sion@@ s.
This process will take about 6 to 8 weeks to comple@@ te.
The purpose of this will be to educ@@ ate the cli@@ ent on various th@@ ings inclu@@ ding, information on what AR@@ V@@ s are, how they work@@ , the side effec@@ ts, the import@@ ance of ad@@ her@@ ence and dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ t@@ anc@@ e.
The counsel@@ lor@@ s would also need to do a social and psy@@ cho@@ logical assessment of the cli@@ ent in order for the medical te@@ am to decide if the cli@@ ent will quali@@ fy for AR@@ V treat@@ ment.
If the cli@@ ent does quali@@ fy then on@@ going counselling and clinic visi@@ ts will be nee@@ de@@ d.
If the cli@@ ent does not y@@ et quali@@ fy then the c@@ ou@@ sel@@ l@@ or and the cli@@ ent will work together on the proble@@ m so that the cli@@ ent will be able to quali@@ f@@ y.
The cli@@ ent has to ag@@ ree to take responsibility for their own health and treat@@ ment.
This means taking own@@ ership around p@@ ill tak@@ ing, atten@@ ding all ses@@ sions and ens@@ uring that they comply with the conditions of the programme.
In conclu@@ sion@@ , HIV positive people will be able to receive free AR@@ V ther@@ ap@@ y when their immun@@ e system is we@@ ak and needs to be streng@@ th@@ ened (C@@ D@@ 4 below 200@@ ) and when they have been able to s@@ how that they are ready for a lif@@ e-@@ long commit@@ ment to the ther@@ ap@@ y.
Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore you will need to go to your nearest clinic to be assess@@ ed as to whether you quali@@ fy for the programme.
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : H@@ oor@@ ay@@ !@@ !@@ !
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : I@@ '@@ m g@@ la@@ d to he@@ ar you are ex@@ ci@@ ted about the AR@@ V@@ 's being made fre@@ ely availa@@ ble.
It is diffic@@ ult for me to sa@@ y you will quali@@ fy to be on AR@@ V@@ '@@ s.
The best thing for you to do is to go to your nearest clinic or doctor and request that they ref@@ er you to an HIV clinic@@ .
At the clinic they are going to take bloo@@ ds from you to test your C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t, which hel@@ ps the doc@@ tors to determine how str@@ ong your immun@@ e system is or how high your vir@@ al load is.
R@@ em@@ em@@ ber@@ , to quali@@ fy to be on AR@@ V@@ 's you have to have a C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t of less than 200 or an AIDS defin@@ ing ill@@ n@@ ess.
O@@ ur immun@@ e system is like our bo@@ d@@ y's arm@@ y.
I@@ t@@ 's job is to ke@@ ep us health@@ y by fi@@ gh@@ ting any ger@@ ms or diseases that att@@ ac@@ k us.
The immun@@ e system is made up of special c@@ el@@ ls called C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s.
When a person has a str@@ ong immun@@ e system they have lo@@ ts of C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s.
If we want to know how str@@ ong a person@@ 's immun@@ e system is, we do a C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t.
To go back to how HIV att@@ ac@@ ks the immun@@ e syste@@ m@@ : When a person is infected with HIV@@ , it takes over the C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s.
The virus st@@ op@@ s the C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ el@@ ls from fi@@ gh@@ ting off diseases and for@@ ces them to make more vir@@ uses in@@ ste@@ ad@@ .
Af@@ ter many years the person has a lo@@ t of virus in their bl@@ ood and very few C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s.
When the immun@@ e system is low opportun@@ is@@ tic infec@@ tions may set in such as TB, which will low@@ er the immun@@ e system even mor@@ e, but as you know TB can be treated even if a person is HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
A re@@ min@@ der, there is no c@@ ure for HIV@@ .
An@@ ti@@ retrovir@@ al dr@@ ug@@ s are medic@@ ation that could help you to live a longer and health@@ ier lif@@ e, by s@@ low@@ ing down the effec@@ ts of the virus on your bo@@ d@@ y.
Act now so that you benefit from the available AR@@ V program@@ .

How Do I T@@ alk To M@@ y Children about HIV and AID@@ S@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I have two children under the age of 10 years and they often ask ques@@ tions about very comple@@ x issu@@ es.
Rec@@ ent@@ ly, their ques@@ tions about HIV and AIDS have become chall@@ en@@ ging to an@@ sw@@ er and I fe@@ el like I am not al@@ ways sure of what to sa@@ y or how I should appro@@ ach the t@@ op@@ ic@@ .
I am aw@@ are ho@@ we@@ ver that they need to have some inform@@ ation.
What do I do@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : T@@ al@@ king to children about diffic@@ ult th@@ ings could often leave parents w@@ onder@@ ing whether they have hand@@ led the ques@@ tions ade@@ qu@@ ately and appropri@@ ate@@ ly.
HIV and AIDS are such comple@@ x issues to t@@ alk about because they present a chall@@ en@@ ge to all of us.
Al@@ so when we start t@@ al@@ king about HIV and AIDS we re@@ ali@@ z@@ e that we mi@@ ght also have to t@@ alk about relating issues such as se@@ x and s@@ ex@@ u@@ ali@@ ty.
Your s@@ ense is ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te@@ ly spo@@ t-@@ on that children need to have information regarding HIV and AID@@ S.
J@@ ust as we would te@@ ach our children the rules of c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing the street in order to be safe and have a way of de@@ aling with a poten@@ ti@@ ally dan@@ ger@@ ous situ@@ ation so we need to te@@ ach our children about other poten@@ ti@@ ally ris@@ k@@ y situ@@ ations.
We are tr@@ ying to ra@@ ise children in an environment where viol@@ ence is comm@@ on, HIV infec@@ tion is gro@@ w@@ ing, dr@@ ug@@ s are wid@@ ely spread and e@@ asi@@ ly availa@@ ble@@ , and high@@ -@@ risk sexual activ@@ ity is the nor@@ m.
This all means that if we are to address and t@@ alk about any of these issu@@ es, we need to fir@@ st@@ ly be encour@@ aging open and effective communic@@ ation.
This would consi@@ st of both an@@ sw@@ ering ques@@ tions as well as li@@ st@@ ening car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly even when the t@@ op@@ ic@@ (@@ s) of disc@@ us@@ sion is not e@@ as@@ y to deal with@@ .
Wh@@ y is it important for parents to communic@@ ate with their children about HIV and AID@@ S@@ ?
* Children need to be able to protect them@@ sel@@ ves

* They also need to be prepar@@ ed for chall@@ eng@@ es that mi@@ ght fac@@ e them as teen@@ ag@@ ers or later as young ad@@ ults
When children ask you ques@@ tions it is because they trust that you are able to give them some inform@@ ation.
S@@ ome@@ times they will also ask so as to confir@@ m or veri@@ fy other s@@ our@@ ces of information that mi@@ ght not necess@@ ar@@ ily be accur@@ ate@@ !

Is Coun@@ selling N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary before H@@ av@@ ing an Aids T@@ est@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I want to have an AIDS test but I@@ '@@ m to@@ ld I have to be counsel@@ led before I can be tes@@ ted.
Is this necess@@ ary@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : The law do@@ es@@ n@@ 't al@@ low HIV testing to take place unless you are fully inform@@ ed be@@ for@@ ehand@@ .
The counselling is to provide you with ade@@ qu@@ ate information so that you can decide whether you are ready for the test and its possible con@@ sequ@@ enc@@ es.
This en@@ ab@@ les you to give what is kno@@ wn as "@@ inform@@ ed cons@@ ent@@ .@@ "
Pre@@ -@@ test counselling is also necessary to make sure that the ti@@ ming of the test is right in order to make certain you receive a re@@ li@@ able res@@ ult@@ .
If a test is conduc@@ ted to@@ o soon after risk be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our has taken pla@@ ce, the test may not give an accur@@ ate res@@ ult@@ .
For example, if you had had un@@ protec@@ ted se@@ x within the previous thir@@ teen weeks and were infec@@ ted, with HIV on one of those occ@@ asion@@ s, testing now would be to@@ o soon to be sure of the test indic@@ ating that you have been infec@@ ted.
This is kno@@ wn as "@@ being in the W@@ in@@ do@@ w Per@@ i@@ o@@ d.@@ "
The ob@@ ject of the test is to find out whether "@@ anti@@ bo@@ dies@@ " to HIV are present in the bloo@@ d.
If the body has produc@@ ed c@@ el@@ ls (@@ kno@@ wn as anti@@ bo@@ dies@@ ) to fi@@ ght the virus then this sho@@ ws that the virus has enter@@ ed the bo@@ d@@ y.
However, it takes up to thir@@ teen weeks from the infec@@ tion date for these anti@@ bo@@ dies to be de@@ tec@@ table and so it is necessary to w@@ ai@@ t for this period to el@@ ap@@ se in order to make sure that the test result is re@@ li@@ ab@@ le.
In order for you to determine when you have been at ris@@ k, you first of all need to know what are the various ways in which you could become infected and what are the relevant deg@@ re@@ es of ris@@ k.
For example, some people th@@ ink that '@@ d@@ ry@@ ' k@@ is@@ sing is a ris@@ k, wh@@ er@@ e@@ as it is no@@ t.
By ex@@ pla@@ ining what is and what is not risk be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our we en@@ able you to judge when you were last at risk and what is your over@@ all deg@@ ree of ris@@ k.
In some cases it tur@@ ns out that testing is pro@@ bab@@ ly not necess@@ ary.
In other cases testing should be del@@ ay@@ ed, e.g. if you are in the W@@ in@@ do@@ w Per@@ i@@ o@@ d.
We also make use of the counselling ses@@ sion to provide information about effective preven@@ t@@ ative meas@@ ur@@ es.
The tes@@ ts them@@ sel@@ ves are very re@@ li@@ ab@@ le.
However, it is ess@@ enti@@ al that they are conduc@@ ted at the right ti@@ me, so a gre@@ at deal depend@@ s on whether the information you provide about the ti@@ ming and nature of your risk be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our is accur@@ ate.
H@@ ol@@ ding back information can only under@@ min@@ e the re@@ li@@ ability of the test@@ .
If you are not in the W@@ in@@ do@@ w Per@@ i@@ o@@ d and you test "@@ N@@ eg@@ ati@@ ve@@ "@@ , the result is re@@ li@@ able and you are NO@@ T infected with HIV@@ .
I@@ f, ho@@ wever, your test sho@@ ws that you have been infected with HIV@@ , a sec@@ ond@@ , confir@@ mat@@ ory test will be conduc@@ ted to eli@@ min@@ ate any possible er@@ r@@ or, even th@@ ough our experi@@ ence to date is that the second test inv@@ ari@@ ably confir@@ ms the first test@@ .
Testing positive for the HIV does not necess@@ ar@@ ily me@@ an that you have AIDS but it does me@@ an that you can infec@@ t oth@@ ers.
Ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, many issues will be ra@@ ised by recei@@ ving a Po@@ si@@ tive res@@ ult@@ .
At ATI@@ CC we are able to offer up to six post@@ -@@ test ses@@ sions to support those who test positive and their part@@ ners@@ .
These ses@@ sions are provided by registered psy@@ cho@@ log@@ is@@ ts with consider@@ able experi@@ ence in this fiel@@ d.
There is no charge and all counselling is conduc@@ ted in the str@@ ic@@ test conf@@ id@@ ence.

Can M@@ y Children Con@@ tract HIV through C@@ as@@ ual Me@@ an@@ s@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : M@@ y h@@ us@@ b@@ and rec@@ ently tes@@ ted HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
We have been se@@ e@@ ing a counsel@@ l@@ or but I am still n@@ erv@@ ous about some of the th@@ ings I was tol@@ d.
We were to@@ ld that you can@@ 't get infected with HIV by sharing c@@ up@@ s and spo@@ ons and to@@ wel@@ s, but I have three children aged 12, 10 and 7 and my n@@ erv@@ ous@@ ness ste@@ ms from the f@@ act that I wor@@ ry that we mi@@ ght get it through cas@@ ual means any@@ wa@@ y.
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : To be able to prevent HIV infec@@ tion it is important that one under@@ stand@@ s the mo@@ des of trans@@ mission of the virus in order to prevent ge@@ tting infec@@ ted.
Your counsel@@ l@@ or was qui@@ te correc@@ t in sa@@ ying that you cannot contract HIV from cas@@ ual contact such as h@@ ug@@ g@@ ing, sharing f@@ ood, sharing e@@ ating u@@ ten@@ si@@ l@@ s, sh@@ ak@@ ing hand@@ s, using the same to@@ il@@ et as someone with HIV@@ , or by any other contact where bl@@ ood is not trans@@ fer@@ red from the open w@@ ound of an infected person to the open w@@ ound of another person@@ .
In@@ sec@@ ts such as mo@@ s@@ q@@ uit@@ o@@ es also do not spread HIV from person to person@@ .
There are four ways in which one can become infected with HIV@@ .
1. Un@@ protec@@ ted S@@ exual Inter@@ cour@@ se.
Mo@@ st people become infected through having un@@ protec@@ ted se@@ x (@@ not using a con@@ dom@@ ).
2. Mo@@ ther to Child Trans@@ mission
Women who are infected with HIV can pas@@ s the virus to their un@@ bor@@ n bab@@ ies during pregn@@ anc@@ y, during labour and deliver@@ y, or through bre@@ ast fe@@ ed@@ ing.
3. Rec@@ ei@@ ving Inf@@ ected Bl@@ ood into O@@ ne@@ 's Bl@@ ood@@ stre@@ am@@ .
One could become infected if HIV infected bl@@ ood comes into direct contact with that person@@ 's bloo@@ d.
This could happ@@ en through an open s@@ or@@ e, sharing ra@@ z@@ or bla@@ des or ne@@ ed@@ les that were used by someone already infected with HIV@@ , from recei@@ ving infected bl@@ ood during a bl@@ ood trans@@ fu@@ sion.
However, in South Africa all don@@ ated bl@@ ood is tes@@ ted for HIV before it is used in bl@@ ood trans@@ fu@@ sions to ensure that the bl@@ ood supp@@ ly is as safe as pos@@ si@@ ble.
How can HIV be preven@@ te@@ d@@ ?
Par@@ ents should disc@@ us@@ s s@@ ex@@ u@@ ality with their children from an early age.
Pe@@ op@@ le, especially young peop@@ le, should be encour@@ aged not to have se@@ x until they are ready and then they need to ag@@ ree with their part@@ ners to be f@@ ai@@ th@@ ful to each other in a st@@ able rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p.
C@@ ond@@ oms should al@@ ways be used during sexual contact outside of a st@@ ab@@ le, mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p.
When using sk@@ in pi@@ erc@@ ing instru@@ ments such as ra@@ z@@ or blad@@ es, ne@@ ed@@ les or sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es, these should be new or otherwise proper@@ ly s@@ teri@@ lis@@ ed.
These instru@@ ments should not be shar@@ ed with other people cas@@ u@@ al@@ ly.

I have he@@ ard so much about HIV and AID@@ S, the la@@ test being that more and more children are being infec@@ ted.
What are the chan@@ ces of my child contrac@@ ting HIV/AIDS at pla@@ y school@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : O@@ f@@ ten HIV/AIDS is associ@@ ated with and th@@ ou@@ ght of as an ad@@ ult concer@@ n and issu@@ e.
O@@ ver the p@@ ast dec@@ a@@ de, children have ho@@ we@@ ver received atten@@ tion with regard to HIV/@@ AID@@ S, not only ho@@ we@@ ver as those se@@ en as affected but also as those who at risk of infec@@ tion.
To al@@ la@@ y your f@@ ear@@ s, it is necessary to state that the high@@ est risk of trans@@ mission of HIV in children is through ver@@ tical infec@@ tion.
Other s@@ our@@ ces of HIV infec@@ tion in children are through child sexual abuse and car@@ ing for those infected (@@ this is usually the case in ol@@ der childr@@ en@@ ).
In@@ cre@@ ased research in the area of HIV/AIDS and children s@@ how that children who have been infected ver@@ tic@@ ally often live to p@@ uber@@ ty and that these children have become more vi@@ sible in certain sett@@ ings.
What you could pos@@ si@@ bly have come ac@@ ross regarding the increase in the number of infected children is what is referred to as l@@ ong@@ -@@ term progres@@ s@@ or@@ s.
These are children who have been ver@@ tic@@ ally infec@@ ted, and have li@@ ved with the virus for many years before be@@ com@@ ing ill and succ@@ um@@ b@@ ing to the diseas@@ e.
These are children infected with HIV who remain rel@@ ati@@ vely health@@ y and who manage to live through child@@ hoo@@ d.
They therefore are able to do most th@@ ings that "@@ nor@@ mal@@ " children do@@ , for example, going to school@@ , having f@@ ri@@ end@@ s, pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es@@ /@@ spor@@ t, et@@ c.
There are also those referred to as sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term progres@@ s@@ or@@ s.
These are HIV positive children who also through ver@@ tical trans@@ mission have become infec@@ ted, but because of se@@ ver@@ ely com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed immun@@ e syste@@ m@@ s, become ill soon after bir@@ th@@ .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in the first year they have usually experi@@ enc@@ ed many ill@@ nesses and often only live until appro@@ xim@@ ately age 5.
D@@ uring these few year@@ s, because of com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed health and func@@ tion@@ ing, they often require much more atten@@ tion, and are often not as able to develop with the same fre@@ edom as other children of si@@ mi@@ lar age.
O@@ f@@ ten it is un@@ li@@ kel@@ y that "@@ s@@ low@@ -@@ progres@@ s@@ or@@ s@@ " would be going to pla@@ y school@@ .
This sa@@ id@@ , it is important to state that while children eng@@ age in rough@@ -@@ and -@@ tu@@ m@@ ble g@@ am@@ es some@@ ti@@ m@@ es, the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of being infected at pla@@ y school is very minim@@ al.
HIV is trans@@ mitted via bo@@ di@@ ly f@@ l@@ uid@@ s, main@@ ly bloo@@ d.
HIV can be passed on through@@ :
* Un@@ protec@@ ted sexual inter@@ course
* In@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous dr@@ ug us@@ e, using infected ne@@ ed@@ les
* Ver@@ tical trans@@ mission (@@ as disc@@ uss@@ ed previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ )
The above se@@ em to be activities to which ad@@ ults are ex@@ posed and or experi@@ ence.
The main fac@@ tor ho@@ we@@ ver is ex@@ pos@@ ure to bloo@@ d, as this bo@@ di@@ ly f@@ lui@@ d is the most "@@ conc@@ entr@@ ate@@ d@@ " with HIV@@ .
Childr@@ en, while c@@ uri@@ ou@@ s, mi@@ ght be concerned about their f@@ ri@@ end or someone who has h@@ ur@@ t them@@ sel@@ ves and are ble@@ ed@@ ing, but are not that c@@ uri@@ ous to handle bloo@@ d.
The si@@ ght of bl@@ ood is en@@ ough for children nat@@ ur@@ ally to be c@@ au@@ ti@@ ou@@ s.
However, like we te@@ ach our children other important th@@ ings, like their addres@@ s, telephone num@@ b@@ ers, how to c@@ ross the stre@@ et, so as to be saf@@ e, we should also te@@ ach our children how to protect them@@ sel@@ ves in terms of HIV@@ .
Of cour@@ se, this like all comple@@ x th@@ ings we te@@ ach our children needs to be age@@ -@@ speci@@ fic@@ .
It would therefore at "@@ pla@@ y school@@ " age be us@@ ef@@ ul to te@@ ach children what to do when there is ex@@ pos@@ ure to bloo@@ d.
What is us@@ ef@@ ul and in many schools this is what is being ta@@ u@@ gh@@ t, is the follow@@ ing:
* Do not t@@ ou@@ ch the bl@@ ood
* Call a teach@@ er or another ad@@ ult immedi@@ ately
* T@@ ry to remain cal@@ m and not to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d the in@@ j@@ ured person
It is ir@@ on@@ ic ho@@ we@@ ver that it is the infected chil@@ d, ra@@ ther than the un@@ infected child who is more at risk of be@@ com@@ ing ill from shar@@ ed contac@@ t.
Pla@@ y@@ schools are often pla@@ ces where there are num@@ er@@ ous b@@ ug@@ s af@@ lo@@ at@@ .
The infected child's com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed immun@@ ity pla@@ ces hi@@ m@@ /@@ her in a vul@@ ner@@ able position to become very ill from p@@ ic@@ king up a bu@@ g that the un@@ infected child's immun@@ e system would be able to fi@@ ght with rel@@ ative e@@ as@@ e.

An@@ s@@ wer@@ : It is under@@ stand@@ able that you fe@@ el wor@@ ri@@ ed about bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding your bab@@ y as you are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
It is important that you focus on what is best for your bab@@ y and to ensure that the chan@@ ces of your bab@@ y being infected are li@@ mi@@ ted.
S@@ har@@ ing the f@@ act of your HIV status with oth@@ ers is your cho@@ ice enti@@ re@@ ly.
As you were inform@@ ed by the Coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or at the MO@@ U concerning the Mo@@ ther to Child Trans@@ mission Program@@ me, it is important that you consi@@ der all the fe@@ eding op@@ tions and choo@@ se what is best sui@@ ted to your bab@@ y, according to your circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
I don@@ 't know how much you re@@ member from your first counselling ses@@ sion@@ , but you need to choo@@ se to either exclu@@ si@@ vely bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed or to form@@ ula fe@@ ed your bab@@ y.
Ex@@ c@@ lu@@ sive bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding means only bre@@ ast@@ mil@@ k and no@@ thing el@@ se but bre@@ ast@@ mil@@ k (@@ except per@@ h@@ ap@@ s for prescribed medic@@ ine from the clinic@@ ).
No water, form@@ ula@@ , ju@@ ic@@ es, gri@@ pe water or even a d@@ um@@ m@@ y.
All these th@@ ings together with bre@@ ast@@ mil@@ k constitu@@ tes MI@@ X@@ ED FE@@ ED@@ ING and this can be har@@ m@@ ful to the bab@@ y
Once you have chan@@ ged from bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding to form@@ ula fe@@ ed@@ ing, you should NE@@ VE@@ R put the bab@@ y back on@@ to the bre@@ ast@@ .
This would be mix@@ ed fe@@ eding and could c@@ ause the bab@@ y to become HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
The important thing about bre@@ ast mil@@ k is the first mil@@ k the mother produc@@ es, called Co@@ lo@@ str@@ um@@ .
This lin@@ es the bab@@ y's st@@ om@@ ach and gu@@ t, and this protec@@ ts the bab@@ y from infec@@ tions.
Bre@@ ast mil@@ k also contains all the nu@@ tri@@ ents the bab@@ y ne@@ ed@@ s.
It is al@@ ways at the right temper@@ at@@ ure@@ , is e@@ asi@@ ly available (@@ the more you bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed the more mil@@ k you produc@@ e@@ ), and it also sav@@ es time.
You need to re@@ member the basic hy@@ gi@@ ene principles of clean@@ ing your ni@@ p@@ ples before you bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed to prevent infec@@ tions.
You have to make sure that bab@@ y la@@ t@@ ches correc@@ tly on@@ to the ni@@ p@@ p@@ le so that you can a@@ vo@@ id having cr@@ ac@@ ked ni@@ p@@ pl@@ es, which ap@@ ar@@ t from being pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ , could ex@@ pose the bab@@ y to HIV infec@@ tion.
If you develop a cr@@ ac@@ ked ni@@ p@@ p@@ le stop fe@@ eding from that bre@@ ast@@ .
R@@ a@@ ther use the other bre@@ ast and se@@ ek medical treatment immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
For all ad@@ vic@@ e, please contact your MO@@ U or bab@@ y clinic immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
As f@@ ar as the bab@@ y is concer@@ n@@ ed, should the bab@@ y have an infec@@ tion (@@ or@@ al th@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ , ga@@ stro@@ -@@ en@@ teri@@ tis et@@ c@@ ), you need to take bab@@ y to the clinic immedi@@ ately sin@@ ce the bab@@ y is at risk of be@@ com@@ ing infected with HIV@@ .
F@@ ro@@ m six months of age the bab@@ y can be star@@ ted on certain so@@ lid f@@ oo@@ ds as advis@@ ed by the clinic@@ .
This br@@ ings me to the second fe@@ eding op@@ tion, For@@ m@@ ula Fe@@ ed@@ ing.
If you choo@@ se to form@@ ula fe@@ ed your bab@@ y, then he@@ /@@ she needs to be exclu@@ si@@ vely form@@ ula f@@ ed for 6 month@@ s.
You will need to con@@ nec@@ t with your MO@@ U so that it can be arran@@ ged for you to leave the MO@@ U after delivery with suff@@ icient form@@ ula to last until your first visit to the bab@@ y clinic@@ .
At the bab@@ y clinic you will be supp@@ lied regul@@ arly with form@@ ula for six month@@ .
The most important thing to re@@ member about form@@ ula is to prepar@@ e it ex@@ ac@@ tly as in@@ struc@@ ted according to the weight and age of your bab@@ y.
Any de@@ vi@@ ation could c@@ ause your bab@@ y to become ill@@ .
If you form@@ ula@@ -@@ fe@@ ed your bab@@ y, the recom@@ men@@ ded way to do this is by cu@@ p fe@@ ed@@ ing.
At the clinic you will be sho@@ wn how this is don@@ e.
Th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly clean@@ ing the cu@@ p and spo@@ on you use is ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te@@ ly necessary in order to prevent infec@@ tions to the bab@@ y.
You will need to decide which op@@ tion is best for you.
The risk of HIV trans@@ mission will be l@@ ess@@ ened if you exclu@@ si@@ vely bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed your bab@@ y for not longer than four month@@ s.
For@@ m@@ ula fe@@ eding means the bab@@ y will not be at risk of ge@@ tting infected with HIV@@ , but could be at risk for other infec@@ tions like g@@ as@@ tr@@ o en@@ teri@@ ti@@ s, p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ i@@ a, et@@ c.

In terms of ris@@ k, as f@@ ar as it is kno@@ wn@@ , there has been no research conduc@@ ted to establish ex@@ ac@@ tly what the rate of trans@@ mission is, through or@@ al s@@ ex@@ .
Some op@@ in@@ i@@ ons are that or@@ al se@@ x is Lo@@ w to Medium R@@ is@@ k, while other op@@ in@@ i@@ ons have r@@ ated it as Medium to High R@@ is@@ k.
It should be re@@ m@@ em@@ ber@@ ed that it is by being ex@@ posed to the high risk body f@@ l@@ uid@@ s of a person infected with HIV and by ge@@ tting these body f@@ l@@ uid@@ s into on@@ e@@ 's bl@@ ood@@ stre@@ am, that one could become infected with HIV al@@ so@@ .

If the m@@ uc@@ us m@@ em@@ bran@@ e lin@@ ing is in@@ t@@ act i@@ .e.@@ , un@@ dam@@ age@@ d, HIV cannot be trans@@ mit@@ ted.
This lin@@ ing is very de@@ lic@@ ate and can be e@@ asi@@ ly in@@ j@@ ure@@ d.
A practi@@ cal example of how fr@@ ag@@ ile this m@@ uc@@ us m@@ em@@ bran@@ e is: If one were to take a m@@ ou@@ th@@ ful of ho@@ t co@@ ff@@ e@@ e, the m@@ uc@@ us m@@ em@@ bran@@ e in the m@@ outh would be s@@ cal@@ de@@ d, become tender and inf@@ la@@ me@@ d.

Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : What is anti@@ retrovir@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y@@ ?
How does it work@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently there is no c@@ ure for AID@@ S.
However, there are dr@@ ug@@ s that can s@@ low down the progres@@ s of HIV and th@@ us s@@ low down the dam@@ age to your immun@@ e syste@@ m.
These dr@@ ug@@ s are called anti@@ retrovir@@ als (@@ AR@@ V@@ '@@ s@@ ).
AR@@ V@@ 's s@@ low down the re@@ production rate of HIV@@ .
Once the virus is re@@ produc@@ ing at a s@@ low@@ er r@@ ate, it is less able to har@@ m your immun@@ e syste@@ m.
If your immun@@ e system is func@@ tion@@ ing proper@@ ly, your body is less li@@ kel@@ y to become si@@ c@@ k.
Your immun@@ e system is your bo@@ d@@ y's def@@ ense system against infec@@ tion.
S@@ in@@ ce AR@@ V@@ 's s@@ low down the dam@@ age to your immun@@ e syste@@ m, if they are used proper@@ ly, they al@@ low you to live a lon@@ ger@@ , health@@ ier lif@@ e.
The go@@ als for AR@@ V treatment are:
1. to ensure maximum and la@@ sting control of the amount HIV in your bo@@ d@@ y@@ ;
2. to res@@ tore and protect the immun@@ e func@@ tion@@ ing of the body by allow@@ ing the C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ el@@ ls to re@@ pl@@ en@@ is@@ h their num@@ b@@ ers@@ ;
3. to re@@ duce HIV@@ -@@ related ill@@ nesses and de@@ ath@@ s and
4. in the long r@@ un to improve the quality of life for people living with AID@@ S.
In order to under@@ stand how AR@@ V@@ 's work we need to know about the lif@@ ec@@ yc@@ le of the H@@ I V@@ ir@@ us.
HIV infec@@ ts c@@ el@@ ls of the immun@@ e system and tur@@ ns the c@@ el@@ ls into virus fac@@ tor@@ ies@@ : one virus can create milli@@ ons more of it@@ self@@ , using our own c@@ el@@ ls for this purpos@@ e.
The c@@ el@@ ls that HIV tar@@ gets are called C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s, which form an important part of the immun@@ e syste@@ m.
Once HIV en@@ ters these c@@ el@@ ls it go@@ es through se@@ veral ste@@ ps before new H@@ I vir@@ uses are produc@@ ed.
Each type of AR@@ V works at a different ste@@ p of the HIV lif@@ ec@@ yc@@ le.
You medical doctor or health care worker can ex@@ pla@@ in to you in more det@@ ail how this work@@ s.
In order for AR@@ V treatment to be effective for a long time there is a need to take more than one AR@@ V at a time.
This is kno@@ wn as com@@ bin@@ ation ther@@ ap@@ y and ref@@ ers to the use of a com@@ bin@@ ation of AR@@ V dr@@ ug@@ s in tre@@ ating HIV infec@@ tion.
For AR@@ V@@ 's to be effec@@ tiv@@ e, they need to be taken str@@ ic@@ tly according to your medical doc@@ tor@@ 's in@@ struc@@ tions.
AR@@ V@@ 's can c@@ ause side effec@@ ts such as diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a, ti@@ red@@ ness and he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es et@@ c@@ .@@ , even if they are taken correc@@ t@@ ly.
This does not me@@ an that the dr@@ ug@@ s are not work@@ ing.
If you happ@@ en to experi@@ ence some of these side effec@@ ts, you will need to disc@@ us@@ s it with your doctor who will help to manage the si@@ de-@@ effec@@ ts.
Al@@ ways cons@@ ult your doctor before making any changes to your treat@@ ment.
You will not start AR@@ V treatment immedi@@ ately once you have been diagno@@ sed HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
AR@@ V treatment will start once your C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t is below 200 and/or once you have an AIDS defin@@ ing ill@@ n@@ ess.
In addi@@ tion you will need to receive special counselling to prepar@@ e you for the AR@@ V treatment before you start taking the dr@@ ug@@ s.
AR@@ V@@ 's will not get the H@@ I virus out of your bo@@ d@@ y.
However, the benefits of taking AR@@ V@@ 's include the f@@ act that the func@@ tion@@ ing of your immun@@ e system will be res@@ tor@@ ed and protec@@ te@@ d@@ ; the production of the virus will be able to be control@@ le@@ d@@ ; your health will improve and ulti@@ m@@ ately your life will be pro@@ lon@@ ge@@ d.
AR@@ V treatment is a comple@@ x process and it is advis@@ ed that you disc@@ us@@ s all your op@@ tions with your doctor and counsel@@ l@@ or who will be able to help you and support you during your treat@@ ment.
Un@@ like most medi@@ cations AR@@ V@@ 's need to be taken str@@ ic@@ tly as prescri@@ be@@ d, under medical su@@ per@@ vi@@ sion@@ , for the rest of your lif@@ e.

The soci@@ o-@@ economic status of black people mak@@ es them vul@@ ner@@ able to infec@@ tions like TB, s@@ exually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions (S@@ TI@@ '@@ s@@ ), and HIV/@@ AID@@ S.
E@@ specially vul@@ ner@@ able are those who live in inform@@ al sett@@ le@@ ments as they are most li@@ kel@@ y to be poor and un@@ employ@@ ed.
They live in conditions character@@ ised by poor infrastr@@ uc@@ ture@@ , i@@ .e.@@ . with no sanit@@ ation, no c@@ le@@ an r@@ un@@ ning water, or elec@@ tricity in pla@@ ce.
Over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ding and in some areas@@ , no ven@@ ti@@ l@@ ation promo@@ tes diseas@@ e.
W@@ i@@ th@@ in the black communities the status of women is low@@ , which mak@@ es them vul@@ ner@@ able to s@@ exually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions, as they often fe@@ el the lo@@ ss of power to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate saf@@ er se@@ x (@@ the use of con@@ dom@@ s) with their part@@ n@@ ers, due to a str@@ ong cultural be@@ li@@ ef that a man is the initi@@ ator around sexual mat@@ ter@@ s.
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, their financial depend@@ ency on their part@@ ners mak@@ es them vul@@ ner@@ ab@@ le.
Women living in rural areas and those working on the f@@ arms are even more vul@@ ner@@ able to s@@ exually trans@@ mis@@ sible infec@@ tions including HIV/@@ AID@@ S, as access to health care facilities is diffic@@ ult because services are minim@@ al.
In some situ@@ ations such resources are non-@@ exis@@ ten@@ t.
Ad@@ ded to these circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es, women are dep@@ riv@@ ed of fin@@ anc@@ es.
In other situ@@ ations the fe@@ ar of stig@@ ma may result in women not dis@@ clo@@ sing the f@@ act that they are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
In addi@@ tion, biological fac@@ tors increase a w@@ om@@ an@@ 's vul@@ ner@@ ability due to un@@ de@@ tec@@ ted STI@@ 's and the f@@ act that sexual f@@ lui@@ d remain@@ s within her body for two or three days and can enter the bl@@ ood stre@@ am if there are any l@@ esi@@ ons due to STI@@ 's or for@@ c@@ ef@@ ul inter@@ cour@@ se.
Mo@@ vement of people se@@ ek@@ ing a better lif@@ e, from one area to an@@ oth@@ er, (@@ migr@@ ant la@@ bour@@ ) mak@@ es them vul@@ ner@@ able to HIV as they are a@@ way from their fam@@ i@@ lies for long perio@@ ds of time.

E@@ very child has the right to basic nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties such as@@ :

3. clo@@ thing
4. medical care
5. schoo@@ ling
Children should get these basic needs from their parents or rel@@ ativ@@ es.

Par@@ ents or rel@@ atives maintain children indi@@ rec@@ t@@ ly, when the child li@@ ves with someone el@@ se, by pay@@ ing main@@ ten@@ ance, or money to support the child and provide his or her basic ne@@ ed@@ s.

Who H@@ as a D@@ u@@ ty to Main@@ tain@@ ?
The law requi@@ res a child to be sup@@ ported or main@@ tained by:
1. his or her paren@@ ts, whether marri@@ ed, living toge@@ th@@ er, separ@@ ated or divor@@ c@@ ed, including parents who have adopted the child@@ ; and
2. his or her gr@@ and@@ paren@@ ts, if the child's parents were married to each oth@@ er.
3. This legal du@@ ty is called "@@ the du@@ ty to main@@ tain@@ " or "@@ the du@@ ty to sup@@ port@@ "@@ .
Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e: Maintenance is in the B@@ est Inter@@ ests of the Child &gt What Is the Maintenance Sy@@ stem@@ ?
What Is the Maintenance Sy@@ stem@@ ?
Where parents separ@@ ate, many parents volun@@ tary pay maintenance to the parent living with the chil@@ d.
Other parents f@@ ail to hon@@ our their legal du@@ ty to maintain their chil@@ d.
The maintenance system is the system of courts which ens@@ ures that parents hon@@ our their du@@ ty to maintain their childr@@ en.
A maintenance court can order a parent who does not live with his or her child to pay maintenance for the support of his or her chil@@ d.
The maintenance system therefore ens@@ ures that parents not living with their children make a fair financial contribu@@ tion towards the support of their childr@@ en.

M@@ ust I still pay maintenance if the other par@@ ent@@ :
* re@@ marri@@ es@@ ?
* is involved in another rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ ?
* does not let me see the childr@@ en@@ ?
Your childr@@ en's right to their basic needs has no@@ thing to do with your view of the other par@@ ent@@ 's be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our@@ .
Your children still need main@@ ten@@ ance, and you must still pay main@@ ten@@ ance, even if the other parent re@@ marri@@ es or gets involved in another rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p.
Ag@@ ain@@ , your children are still entitled to maintenance even if you cannot see them@@ .
Your du@@ ty to maintain them is tot@@ ally separ@@ ate from their right to see you.
Your du@@ ty to pay does not dep@@ end on whether or not you can see them@@ .

How Is the A@@ m@@ ount of Maintenance Cal@@ cu@@ la@@ te@@ d@@ ?
The maintenance court or the maintenance officer at court will help in working out how much money should be paid as main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e.
U@@ su@@ al@@ ly, the court first works out how much the children need for their maintenance (@@ ie@@ .@@ , to provide them with f@@ ood, sh@@ el@@ ter, clo@@ th@@ es, and so on@@ ).
The court will then see that each parent mak@@ es a fair contribu@@ tion to those ne@@ ed@@ s, usually by requi@@ ring them to contribu@@ te in propor@@ tion to their respective in@@ com@@ es.

Ret@@ ur@@ n for payment of provi@@ sional tax â first payment
Where an individual ear@@ ns tax@@ able income that is not subject to SI@@ TE or PA@@ Y@@ E de@@ duc@@ tions , he or she has to pay provi@@ sional tax on this in@@ com@@ e.
Provi@@ sional tax pay@@ ments are made on a si@@ x@@ -@@ month@@ ly basi@@ s.
Provi@@ sional tax is inten@@ ded to help tax@@ pay@@ ers meet their tax li@@ abili@@ ties on an on-@@ going basis as op@@ posed to pay@@ ing a bi@@ g amount once a year on assess@@ ment.
The provi@@ sional tax paid will be off@@ set against the fin@@ al tax li@@ ability that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assess@@ ment.
A person who becomes li@@ able for the payment of provi@@ sional tax must@@ , within 30 days of be@@ com@@ ing li@@ ab@@ le, apply in writing for registration at the local bran@@ ch office of the South African Revenue Service .
F@@ ail@@ ure to do so will result in interest and pen@@ al@@ ties being le@@ vi@@ ed on late pay@@ ments and additional tax for the late sub@@ mission of retur@@ n@@ s.
The due date for the payment of provi@@ sional tax for the first period is within six months from the start of the year of assess@@ ment.
The first provi@@ sional tax payment must repres@@ ent hal@@ f of the tax li@@ ability for the full tax year.
Cal@@ cu@@ late provi@@ sional tax as follows for the first perio@@ d@@ :

C@@ li@@ ents pay@@ ing over the coun@@ ter at any A@@ B@@ SA@@ , F@@ N@@ B@@ , or N@@ ed@@ bank bran@@ ch will no longer need to supp@@ ly a bank account number and bank co@@ de when making pay@@ ments.
This applies equ@@ ally to all A@@ B@@ SA@@ , F@@ N@@ B@@ , N@@ ed@@ ban@@ k, and Stand@@ ard B@@ ank inter@@ net ban@@ king cli@@ en@@ ts.
All that will be required is:
the cli@@ ent@@ 's 19@@ -@@ di@@ gi@@ t payment reference num@@ ber@@ ; and
the benef@@ ici@@ ary ID / account number which is lin@@ ked to a specific type of tax to make pay@@ ments.
These details are reflec@@ ted on the payment advice of the IR@@ P 6 retur@@ n@@ .
P@@ ay@@ ments that do not comply with both the abo@@ v@@ e-@@ mentioned payment reference number and the benef@@ ici@@ ary ID will not be accep@@ ted.
If the last day for payment f@@ al@@ ls on a public ho@@ li@@ day or week@@ end@@ , the payment must be made on the last working day pri@@ or to the public ho@@ li@@ day or week@@ end@@ .
For more details ref@@ er to the SARS website www.@@ sar@@ s@@ .gov.za
If the first provi@@ sional tax payment is based on an esti@@ m@@ ated tax@@ able income that is less than the basic am@@ oun@@ t, a request and mo@@ tiv@@ ation should be inclu@@ de@@ d.
The IR@@ P 6 return for the first period now includes a sp@@ ace where you must mo@@ tiv@@ ate such a requ@@ est@@ .
If SARS is not s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed, a re@@ vis@@ ed esti@@ mate may be requ@@ es@@ ted.
To a@@ vo@@ id pen@@ al@@ ties and inter@@ es@@ t, make sure that IR@@ P 6 retur@@ ns are submitted to the relevant SARS bran@@ ch office well before the due date for pay@@ ment.
This will ensure that your request is received and process@@ ed in time.
The payment advice por@@ tion of the IR@@ P 6 return is now on a separ@@ ate pa@@ ge.
Your return can therefore be submitted separ@@ ately from your pay@@ ment.
