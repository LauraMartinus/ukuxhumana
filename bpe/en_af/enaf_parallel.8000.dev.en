Wh@@ y is meas@@ les a dan@@ ger@@ ous diseas@@ e?
Y@@ oung childr@@ en, who sur@@ vi@@ ve meas@@ les are we@@ ak@@ ened by the disease and may later die from mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion or other ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es.
Me@@ as@@ les is also an important c@@ ause of mental ret@@ ard@@ ation and b@@ lin@@ d@@ n@@ ess.
A qu@@ ar@@ ter of all de@@ ath@@ s from meas@@ les occ@@ ur before the age of one year.
Me@@ as@@ les in ol@@ der children usually occ@@ ur as out@@ bre@@ ak@@ s, when lar@@ ge group@@ s of children get meas@@ les at the same time.
The risk of a meas@@ les out@@ bre@@ ak is higher when group@@ s of children ga@@ ther together for example in cr@@ Ã¨@@ ches day care centres and at school@@ s.
Is it important to immun@@ ise children during the meas@@ les c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ ?
Y@@ es - It is IM@@ POR@@ T@@ AN@@ T to bring children for the E@@ X@@ TR@@ A meas@@ les in@@ jec@@ tion during the c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ .
Children who mis@@ s the immunis@@ ation c@@ ampaign mi@@ ght not be fully protec@@ ted against the meas@@ les vir@@ us.
I he@@ ard that the parents or guardi@@ ans of children must sign a consent form before a child can receive the ex@@ tr@@ a meas@@ les immunis@@ ation.
Is it tr@@ u@@ e?
If a child is to be immun@@ ised at a school or cr@@ Ã¨@@ ch@@ e where the parent is not present when the immunis@@ ation is gi@@ ven@@ , a consent form will be given to parents or guardi@@ ans of children in cr@@ Ã¨@@ ch@@ es, day care centres and at schools in advan@@ ce.
It provides and opportun@@ ity to inform parents or guardi@@ ans about the ex@@ tr@@ a meas@@ les in@@ jec@@ tion.
In this cas@@ e, if you ag@@ ree to this immunis@@ ation, please complete and sign the form and send it back to the school or cr@@ Ã¨@@ ch@@ e.
Your child will then receive the immunis@@ ation if consent forms are signed and retur@@ ned on ti@@ me@@ !
If you bring the child to an immunis@@ ation centre during the c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ , it is not necessary for you to fill in a consent form@@ .
PO@@ LI@@ O
What is Poli@@ o@@ ?
Poli@@ o is a cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing diseas@@ e.
It is caused by a very small ger@@ m called the poli@@ o vir@@ us.
Poli@@ o can le@@ ad to permanent la@@ men@@ ess, de@@ form@@ ity and even de@@ ath@@ .
D@@ ue to rou@@ t@@ ine immunis@@ ations in child@@ hoo@@ d, poli@@ o has not been se@@ en in South Africa sin@@ ce 198@@ 9.
However, there have been out@@ bre@@ ak@@ s of poli@@ o in n@@ eighbour@@ ing coun@@ tri@@ es.
How will I rec@@ ogni@@ z@@ e poli@@ o in a child@@ ?
Poli@@ o can be suspec@@ ted when there is su@@ d@@ den we@@ ak@@ ness of the leg or arm or both or other parts of the bo@@ d@@ y.
This we@@ ak@@ ness should not have been present at bir@@ th@@ .
If the person was in@@ j@@ ured j@@ ust before the we@@ ak@@ ness of the person has a histor@@ y of being ment@@ ally ret@@ ar@@ de@@ d, then poli@@ o is not li@@ kel@@ y to be the c@@ ause of the we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess.
Please report any su@@ d@@ den we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ /@@ par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s in a child under 15 years (@@ not caused by injur@@ y@@ ), to the nearest clinic@@ , hospital or doctor for investig@@ ation.

This pre@@ vents the poli@@ o virus from ci@@ r@@ cu@@ lating among childr@@ en.
South Africa is taking part in an ef@@ for@@ t to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate poli@@ o wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de.
It means that the virus will be wi@@ p@@ ed out comple@@ te@@ ly from the fac@@ e of the ear@@ th@@ ,@@ .
Once the poli@@ o virus does not exis@@ t any mor@@ e, children will no longer need to receive poli@@ o immunis@@ ation.
Is it important to immun@@ ise children during the first and second ro@@ un@@ d of the poli@@ o c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ ?
Y@@ es - It is IM@@ POR@@ T@@ AN@@ T to bring children for the first AND the second ro@@ un@@ d of the poli@@ o c@@ ampaign - even if the child is up to date with the rou@@ t@@ ine immunis@@ ations.
To protect children against the poli@@ o vir@@ us, poli@@ o dro@@ ps need to be given T@@ W@@ IC@@ E@@ .

You can also get cre@@ dit from a bank or a micro@@ -@@ len@@ der.
In this cas@@ e, you are given a cas@@ h lo@@ an@@ .

When Can the C@@ redi@@ tor Re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess M@@ y Good@@ s@@ ?
If you bu@@ y on cre@@ di@@ t, the cre@@ di@@ tor usually remain@@ s the own@@ er of the th@@ ings you have bou@@ ght until you have fin@@ is@@ hed pay@@ ing all the inst@@ al@@ ments.
This means that if you can@@ 't pay your month@@ ly inst@@ al@@ men@@ ts, the cre@@ di@@ tor can re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess the items in ques@@ tion.
Un@@ less the cre@@ di@@ tor has a court or@@ der, they can only re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess the item if they have your per@@ mission (@@ this is called "@@ volun@@ tary sur@@ ren@@ der@@ "@@ ).
If the cre@@ di@@ tor wan@@ ts to force you to return the ite@@ m@@ s, then they will need a court or@@ der.
Be@@ fore they can get this or@@ der, the cre@@ di@@ tor must send a registered letter to you war@@ ning you that the pay@@ ments are over@@ due and that the out@@ standing amount must be paid within 30 da@@ ys.
If you have previously f@@ all@@ en be@@ hin@@ d in your pay@@ ments and received a letter of de@@ mand@@ , and you f@@ all be@@ hin@@ d again@@ , the cre@@ di@@ tor will send a letter of de@@ m@@ and gi@@ ving you 14 days to pay the out@@ standing inst@@ al@@ ments.
If you still do not pa@@ y, then the sel@@ ler can get a court order to re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess the g@@ ood@@ s.
If you are pres@@ ented with a court sum@@ mon@@ s, you will have to enter a written ple@@ a at the cour@@ t, or fi@@ le an op@@ pos@@ ing aff@@ id@@ av@@ it, ex@@ pla@@ ining wh@@ y you have not paid the amount (for example, the cre@@ di@@ tor may be cla@@ im@@ ing more from you than you ac@@ tu@@ ally o@@ we@@ ).
Mat@@ ters are usually sett@@ led without a tri@@ al, but if the matter is not sett@@ led and you want to go to court to def@@ end y@@ our@@ self@@ , you need to fi@@ le a No@@ tice of In@@ ten@@ tion to De@@ f@@ end@@ .
If the matter go@@ es to trial and you do not def@@ end y@@ our@@ self or if the court th@@ in@@ ks that you are not j@@ usti@@ fi@@ ed, the court can issue an order allow@@ ing the cre@@ di@@ tor to rec@@ la@@ im the g@@ ood@@ s.
The Sher@@ if@@ f of the court is responsible for re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ing the g@@ ood@@ s.
This official will s@@ how you the court order and can then take the goods a@@ wa@@ y.
If the s@@ her@@ if@@ f has a court or@@ der, then you (@@ or anyone el@@ se sta@@ ying in the hou@@ se at the ti@@ me@@ ) must al@@ low them into the hou@@ se to take the goods a@@ wa@@ y.
S@@ ome@@ ti@@ m@@ es, the cre@@ di@@ tor will not want the goods back and will issue a sum@@ m@@ ons against you to get the money bac@@ k.
In this cas@@ e, the cre@@ di@@ tor will have to ex@@ pla@@ in wh@@ y they can@@ 't rec@@ la@@ im the g@@ ood@@ s.
W@@ ill the inst@@ al@@ ments you have already paid be re@@ fun@@ ded if the goods are re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed@@ ?
The value of the goods is li@@ kel@@ y to have di@@ min@@ is@@ hed sin@@ ce you first bou@@ ght them because they are no longer br@@ and new@@ .
De@@ pen@@ ding on the value of the re@@ pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed g@@ ood@@ s, you may get a re@@ fund (@@ if the value of the goods plus the amount you have already paid is more than what you origin@@ ally ow@@ ed, then you will be paid the differ@@ enc@@ e@@ ).
B@@ ut if the goods are wor@@ th less then the amount that you still o@@ we, then you will still o@@ we the cre@@ di@@ tor mon@@ e@@ y.

M@@ any bar@@ ri@@ ers such as wid@@ es@@ pre@@ ad i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance, fe@@ ar and ster@@ e@@ o@@ types have caused people with dis@@ abili@@ ties to be un@@ fair@@ ly dis@@ crimin@@ ated against in soci@@ ety and in employ@@ ment.
For these reasons they are a designated group in terms of the Employ@@ ment E@@ qu@@ ity Act, 199@@ 8.
The Minister of Labour has therefore approved a Co@@ de of G@@ ood Pr@@ actice on the Employ@@ ment of People with Dis@@ abili@@ ties in terms of the Employ@@ ment E@@ qu@@ ity Act, 199@@ 8.
A@@ I@@ M OF THE CO@@ DE
The Co@@ de is a guide for employ@@ ers and workers to encour@@ age equal opportunities and fair treatment of people with dis@@ abili@@ ties as required by the Ac@@ t.
The Co@@ de is inten@@ ded to educ@@ ate and inform employ@@ ers and workers to under@@ stand their rights and oblig@@ ations to promote cer@@ tain@@ ty and to re@@ duce disp@@ u@@ tes so that people with dis@@ abili@@ ties can effecti@@ vely en@@ jo@@ y and exercise their rights at work.
The Co@@ de is inten@@ ded to help create awareness of the contribu@@ tions people with dis@@ abili@@ ties can make and to encour@@ age employ@@ ers to fully use the skills of such peop@@ le.
DE@@ F@@ IN@@ I@@ TION OF "@@ P@@ E@@ O@@ PL@@ E WIT@@ H DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TI@@ ES@@ "
In terms of the Act the focus is on the effect of a dis@@ ability on the person in rel@@ ation to the working environ@@ ment, and not on the diagno@@ sis or the im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment.
People are considered as "@@ People with Dis@@ abili@@ ti@@ es@@ " who s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy all the crit@@ eria in the defin@@ i@@ tion@@ :
* having a physical or mental im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment
* which is long term or rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ing, and
* which substan@@ ti@@ ally li@@ mits their pro@@ spec@@ ts of entry into or advan@@ cement in employ@@ ment.
RE@@ AS@@ ON@@ A@@ B@@ L@@ Y AC@@ COM@@ O@@ DA@@ TE THE NE@@ ED@@ S OF P@@ E@@ O@@ PL@@ E WIT@@ H DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TIES
Employ@@ ers should adop@@ t the most co@@ st@@ -@@ effective me@@ an that is consistent with effecti@@ vely remo@@ ving the bar@@ ri@@ ers to perform the j@@ ob@@ , and to en@@ jo@@ y equal access to the benefits and opportunities of employ@@ ment.
Re@@ as@@ on@@ able accommod@@ ation applies to applic@@ ants and staff members with dis@@ abili@@ ties who are s@@ uit@@ ably quali@@ fied for the job and may be requi@@ red@@ :
* during the rec@@ r@@ uit@@ ment and sel@@ ec@@ tion process
* in the working environment
* in the way work is usually don@@ e, evalu@@ ated and re@@ war@@ ded
* in the benefits and pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ es of employ@@ ment.
RE@@ C@@ R@@ U@@ IT@@ MENT AND SE@@ LE@@ C@@ TION OF P@@ E@@ O@@ PL@@ E WIT@@ H DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TIES
Employ@@ ers should make job adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments acces@@ sible to people with dis@@ abili@@ ties by identi@@ f@@ ying the in@@ her@@ ent requirements of the post@@ , clear@@ ly descri@@ b@@ ing the skills and cap@@ abili@@ ties required and s@@ etting reasonable crit@@ eria for sel@@ ec@@ tion.
ME@@ D@@ IC@@ AL AND P@@ S@@ Y@@ C@@ HO@@ LO@@ G@@ IC@@ AL TESTING
T@@ ests should comply with the requirements of the Act and must be relevant and appropriate to the work for which the person is being tes@@ ted.
Employ@@ ers should ensure that tes@@ ts do not un@@ fair@@ ly exclu@@ de conditions and should not be bi@@ ased on how or when they are app@@ li@@ ed, assess@@ ed or inter@@ pre@@ ted.
Testing to determine the health status of a person should only be car@@ ri@@ ed out after the employer has established that the person is in f@@ act compet@@ ent to perform the ess@@ enti@@ al job functions or duties and after a job offer has been ma@@ de.
TRA@@ IN@@ ING AND C@@ A@@ RE@@ ER AD@@ V@@ AN@@ C@@ E@@ MENT
People with dis@@ abili@@ ties should be cons@@ ul@@ ted on their c@@ are@@ er advan@@ cement and possible needs and so facilities and materials for training should be acces@@ sible to them@@ .
E@@ valu@@ ation of work performance should clear@@ ly identi@@ fy and fair@@ ly meas@@ ure and re@@ ward performance of the ess@@ enti@@ al functions of the j@@ ob@@ .
RE@@ TA@@ IN@@ ING P@@ E@@ O@@ PL@@ E WIT@@ H DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TIES
Wor@@ kers who become dis@@ abled during employment s@@ hou@@ l@@ d, where reason@@ ably pos@@ si@@ ble@@ , be re-@@ integrated into the work for@@ ce.
I@@ F reason@@ ab@@ le, employ@@ ers should ex@@ pl@@ ore the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of off@@ ering altern@@ ative work@@ , re@@ duced work or fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble work pla@@ ce@@ ment, so that workers are not comp@@ el@@ led or encour@@ aged to termin@@ ate their employ@@ ment.
COM@@ P@@ EN@@ SA@@ TION FOR P@@ E@@ O@@ PL@@ E WIT@@ H DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TIES
When workers become dis@@ abled because of work related ill@@ nesses or accid@@ en@@ ts, the employer should assist that worker to receive the relevant assistance in terms of the Comp@@ ensation for Occupational In@@ j@@ ures and Dis@@ e@@ ases Act from the Comp@@ ensation Fund and to receive the appropriate benefits in terms of the U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ment In@@ sur@@ ance Ac@@ t.
CON@@ F@@ ID@@ ENTI@@ A@@ LI@@ TY
Employ@@ ers must protect the conf@@ identi@@ ality of information that has been dis@@ clo@@ sed by a worker or job applicant with a dis@@ abili@@ ty.
They must take care to ke@@ ep records of private information relating to the dis@@ ability conf@@ identi@@ al and separ@@ ate from general personal rec@@ ord@@ s.
Employ@@ ers may not dis@@ close any information relating to a person@@ 's dis@@ ability without the written consent of the person concer@@ n@@ ed, unless required to do so by law@@ .
B@@ EN@@ EF@@ IT@@ S FOR ST@@ AF@@ F M@@ EM@@ BER@@ S
Employ@@ ers who provide or ar@@ range for occ@@ upational ins@@ ur@@ ance or other benefit plan@@ s for workers must ensure that the benefits do not un@@ fair@@ ly dis@@ crimin@@ ate, either directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly against people with dis@@ abili@@ ties.
EM@@ PL@@ O@@ Y@@ MENT E@@ QU@@ I@@ TY PLANNING
If people with dis@@ abili@@ ties are under@@ -@@ repres@@ ented in all occ@@ upational levels and categories in the work@@ pla@@ ce, the employer should se@@ ek guid@@ ance from organisations that repres@@ ent people with dis@@ abili@@ ties or relevant ex@@ per@@ ts, for example in vo@@ c@@ ational rehabilitation and occ@@ upational ther@@ ap@@ y to bring those vac@@ an@@ cies to the atten@@ tion of possible work se@@ ek@@ ers with dis@@ abili@@ ties.
ED@@ UC@@ ATION AND A@@ W@@ AR@@ EN@@ ESS
Employ@@ ers, employer organisations and trade uni@@ ons should include the Co@@ de in ori@@ ent@@ ation, education and training programmes of work@@ ers.

* This Lo@@ an has to be re@@ pa@@ id@@ .
What is a Burs@@ ary@@ ?
* A burs@@ ary is that por@@ tion of the a@@ ward that does not need to be re@@ pa@@ id@@ .
* The size of the burs@@ ary is dependent on your ac@@ ademi@@ c succ@@ ess.
Who Qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ es for a N@@ S@@ FA@@ S Lo@@ an@@ ?
To quali@@ fy for a lo@@ an you must be@@ :
* registered at a South African uni@@ versity or tech@@ ni@@ kon
* an under@@ gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate, stud@@ ying for a first tertiary educ@@ ational quali@@ fic@@ ation, or

How is the Burs@@ ary Comp@@ on@@ ent of your Lo@@ an Cal@@ cu@@ la@@ te@@ d@@ ?
U@@ p to 40@@ % of the a@@ ward may be con@@ ver@@ ted into a bur@@ sar@@ y, dependent on your end of year resul@@ ts.
* If you pas@@ s all the cour@@ ses for which you have register@@ ed, you quali@@ fy for a 40@@ % bur@@ sar@@ y.
* If you pas@@ s three qu@@ ar@@ ters of the cour@@ s@@ es, you quali@@ fy for a 30@@ % bur@@ sar@@ y.
* If you pas@@ s hal@@ f of the cour@@ s@@ es, you quali@@ fy for a 20@@ % bur@@ sar@@ y.
* If you pas@@ s one qu@@ ar@@ ter of the cour@@ s@@ es, you quali@@ fy for a 10@@ % bur@@ sar@@ y.
* If you pas@@ s n@@ one of the cour@@ s@@ es, you quali@@ fy for no burs@@ ary at all@@ .
What H@@ app@@ ens if You H@@ ave Mon@@ ey L@@ ef@@ t O@@ ver in Your Ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ?
* You can@@ 't receive more money from N@@ S@@ FA@@ S than you require@@ .
* If there is money le@@ f@@ t over in your fee account at the end of the year (for example, if you received a burs@@ ary or a mer@@ it a@@ ward after the N@@ S@@ FA@@ S a@@ ward was gran@@ te@@ d@@ ), the Financial Aid Bureau has to return the money to N@@ S@@ FA@@ S.
This will coun@@ t as your first lo@@ an re@@ pay@@ ment.
* Mon@@ ey le@@ f@@ t over in your account is ne@@ ver paid out to you.
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, it is in your interest to ensure that the money is retur@@ ned to N@@ S@@ FA@@ S to a@@ vo@@ id pay@@ ing interest on it.
What about Inter@@ est@@ ?
Inter@@ est on N@@ S@@ FA@@ S a@@ wards will be cal@@ cu@@ lated at 7@@ % for 2004 as of 1 April 200@@ 4.
What Is Inter@@ est and Wh@@ y does N@@ S@@ FA@@ S Char@@ ge I@@ t@@ ?
Inter@@ est is the cost of bor@@ ro@@ wing mon@@ e@@ y.
Mon@@ e@@ y, like any other com@@ modi@@ ty, has a p@@ ric@@ e att@@ ached to it.
If you deposi@@ t money into a bank accoun@@ t, you ear@@ n interest - in other word@@ s, the bank pa@@ ys you because it can make use of your money while it is deposi@@ ted with them@@ .
When you take back your mon@@ e@@ y, you stop ear@@ ning inter@@ est@@ .
If you bor@@ ro@@ w money from the ban@@ k, you have to pay the bank for the use of their mon@@ e@@ y.
In previous years comm@@ ercial ban@@ ks have char@@ ged as much as 23@@ % interest on stud@@ ent lo@@ an@@ s.
If you had received one of these lo@@ ans you would be required to pay back the lo@@ an within a specific period whether you are employed or no@@ t.
By com@@ par@@ is@@ on, N@@ S@@ FA@@ S@@ 's interest rate is equal to the rate of inf@@ l@@ ation (@@ ty@@ p@@ ically in the late 199@@ 0@@ s 9@@ %@@ ) plus 2@@ %@@ .
This 2@@ % hel@@ ps su@@ st@@ ain the lo@@ an schem@@ e.
It contribu@@ tes towards the administration costs and the sh@@ or@@ t@@ f@@ all resul@@ ting from death and l@@ ong@@ -@@ term non-@@ re@@ payment due to un@@ employ@@ ment.
What is Inf@@ l@@ ation@@ ?
* Each year money lo@@ ses value and can bu@@ y l@@ ess.
* The dec@@ line in the value of money from one year to the next is called inf@@ l@@ ation.
* An example of how inf@@ l@@ ation affec@@ ts your stu@@ dies is the increase in fees each year.
* In order for N@@ S@@ FA@@ S to be able to assist stud@@ ents in fu@@ ture@@ , N@@ S@@ FA@@ S has to try to make sure that the value of its money is re@@ tain@@ ed.
Th@@ at is wh@@ y its interest rate is ti@@ ed to the inf@@ l@@ ation r@@ ate.
* N@@ S@@ FA@@ S@@ 's interest rate is low because it is subsi@@ dis@@ ed by don@@ ations from govern@@ ment, private sector compan@@ ies and over@@ se@@ as don@@ or@@ s.

When Do You St@@ ar@@ t to P@@ ay B@@ ack@@ ?
Once you are employed and your annual sal@@ ary is R@@ 26@@ ,@@ 300 or mor@@ e.
How Mu@@ ch Do You P@@ ay B@@ ack@@ ?
* The re@@ pay@@ ments are work@@ ed out at a rate that will not place a gre@@ at bur@@ den on you.
* Th@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ e, re@@ pay@@ ments are based on the sal@@ ary that you ear@@ n@@ .
* And re@@ pay@@ ments only start once your sal@@ ary is R@@ 26@@ ,@@ 300 or more per year (@@ ie R@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 2 per month@@ ).
At this level your re@@ payment is 3@@ % of your annual salar@@ y.
The rate at which you re@@ pay your lo@@ an is reflec@@ ted in the Re@@ ad@@ y Rec@@ kon@@ er T@@ ab@@ le.
How Do You P@@ ay B@@ ack@@ ?
* N@@ S@@ FA@@ S s@@ ends qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly state@@ ments to all stud@@ ents and will later send a letter information you of your sett@@ lement terms once you become e@@ lig@@ i@@ ble to pay back your lo@@ an@@ .
This happ@@ ens once you start ear@@ ning over R@@ 26 300 a year.
* You are then exp@@ ected to make the necessary arran@@ gemen@@ ts.
These can include a de@@ bi@@ t order on your bank accoun@@ t, direct deposi@@ ts into the N@@ S@@ FA@@ S accoun@@ t, postal or@@ der@@ s, ch@@ equ@@ es or employer de@@ duc@@ tions.
* Whi@@ le N@@ S@@ FA@@ S will inform you how much you need to pa@@ y, it is your responsibility to ensure that you ke@@ ep in t@@ ou@@ ch with

10 Th@@ ings You Ne@@ ed to K@@ now about N@@ S@@ FA@@ S
1. N@@ S@@ FA@@ S was established by the South African Government in 199@@ 6.

3. It is fun@@ ded by the govern@@ ment, international don@@ ors and the private sec@@ tor.
4. TE@@ F@@ SA@@ , which was established in 199@@ 1, man@@ aged and admin@@ ister@@ ed the schem@@ e until 2000 when TE@@ F@@ SA bec@@ ame N@@ S@@ FA@@ S.
5. All of the financial assistance received by a success@@ ful applicant takes the form of a lo@@ an@@ .
6. U@@ p to 40@@ % of lo@@ ans can be con@@ ver@@ ted into burs@@ ari@@ es, dep@@ ending on stud@@ en@@ ts@@ ' pas@@ s r@@ at@@ es.
7. Lo@@ an re@@ pay@@ ments are rec@@ yc@@ led to help fu@@ ture gener@@ ations of stud@@ en@@ ts.

9. Lo@@ an re@@ pay@@ ments are based on individu@@ al@@ s@@ ' ear@@ n@@ ings.

The accident must be identified by its d@@ ate, time and place and must have happ@@ ened as a direct result of your employ@@ ment.
For temporary total dis@@ ab@@ le@@ ment, you can get comp@@ ensation equal to 75@@ % of your month@@ ly ear@@ n@@ ings, up to a maximum of R@@ 2 8@@ 68@@ ,@@ 00 per week@@ .
For permanent dis@@ ab@@ le@@ ment, where the deg@@ ree of dis@@ ab@@ lement is 30@@ % or les@@ s, you can get a l@@ um@@ p su@@ m (@@ one pay@@ ment@@ ) which is usually equal to 15 times your month@@ ly ear@@ n@@ ings.
However, the minimum l@@ um@@ p su@@ m is 15 times R@@ 13@@ 59@@ ,@@ 00 = R@@ 20 38@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00 (@@ if you ear@@ n less than R@@ 13@@ 59 you will get R@@ 20 38@@ 5@@ ).
The maximum l@@ um@@ p su@@ m 15 times R@@ 6 9@@ 63@@ ,@@ 00 = R@@ 10@@ 4 44@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00 (@@ if you ear@@ n more than R@@ 69@@ 63@@ ,@@ 00 you will get R@@ 10@@ 4 44@@ 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ ).
If the deg@@ ree of permanent dis@@ ab@@ lement is 3@@ 1@@ % or mor@@ e, you will not get a l@@ um@@ p sum@@ , you will get a month@@ ly pen@@ sion in@@ ste@@ ad@@ .
The pen@@ sion for total permanent dis@@ ab@@ lement (@@ deg@@ ree of dis@@ ab@@ lement 100@@ %@@ ) is equal to 75@@ % of your month@@ ly ear@@ n@@ ings.
If the deg@@ ree of dis@@ ab@@ lement is less than 100@@ %@@ , the pen@@ sion is propor@@ tion@@ ately l@@ ess.
If the employ@@ ee@@ 's ear@@ n@@ ings are R1 35@@ 9@@ ,@@ 00 per month or les@@ s, the pen@@ sion is cal@@ cu@@ lated on R1 35@@ 9@@ ,@@ 00@@ .
The minimum pen@@ sion in respect of 100@@ % permanent dis@@ ab@@ lement is therefore R1 0@@ 19@@ ,@@ 25 per month@@ .
Where an employ@@ ee di@@ es, the sur@@ vi@@ ving sp@@ ou@@ se is entitled to

Where the employ@@ ee di@@ es, each child under 18 years of age is entitled to a month@@ ly pen@@ sion equal to 20@@ % of the pen@@ sion which would have been pay@@ able to the employ@@ ee for 100@@ % dis@@ ab@@ le@@ ment, up to a maximum of three childr@@ en.
The maximum pen@@ sion pay@@ able to the sp@@ ou@@ se and children together is therefore R@@ 9 3@@ 2@@ 1,@@ 00 per month@@ .
All reasonable medical and transport costs ar@@ ising from the accident are also paid for by the Comp@@ ensation Fun@@ d.

The Road Accid@@ ent Fund (R@@ AF@@ ) was set up to pay comp@@ ensation in respect of people in@@ j@@ ured or kil@@ led in road accid@@ ents through the neg@@ lig@@ ent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.
The system was chan@@ ged so that in@@ stead of comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ins@@ ur@@ ance, there is now a fun@@ d, which gets its money from a lev@@ y on the s@@ ale of fu@@ el@@ .
People can make a claim for comp@@ ensation against the RA@@ F if they are in@@ j@@ ured in a motor vehicle accident as a result of neg@@ lig@@ ent d@@ riv@@ ing.
You must make your application to the RA@@ F within 2 years of the date of the accident in which you sustain@@ ed your in@@ j@@ uri@@ es.
You can make the claim y@@ our@@ self by com@@ pl@@ eting Form 1 and sub@@ mit@@ ting all the necessary docu@@ ments@@ ; or you can get an at@@ tor@@ ney to help with your cla@@ im@@ .
The ex@@ act amount (@@ "@@ qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m@@ "@@ ) paid out for a claim against the RA@@ F depend@@ s on your medical exp@@ ens@@ es, your lo@@ ss of income (@@ p@@ ast and fu@@ ture@@ ), your dis@@ ab@@ le@@ ment, and your pa@@ in and su@@ ffer@@ ing.

If you are a par@@ ent, make sure you contribu@@ te a fair amount towards up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing of your childr@@ en, whether you live with them or no@@ t.
If you are a rel@@ ative of someone who cannot af@@ ford to contribu@@ te, such as gr@@ and@@ paren@@ ts, try your best to help the childr@@ en@@ : after all, they still need sup@@ por@@ t.
You can also help the children by per@@ su@@ ading parents who are not pay@@ ing or who are not pay@@ ing en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , to pay a fair amount of main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e: their children need it.

If you do not live with your childr@@ en, you are not there day to day to provide their basic needs such as sh@@ el@@ ter, f@@ ood, clo@@ th@@ ing, medical care and school@@ ing.
So@@ , you must pay money as maintenance to help the parent living with the children to provide the children with these basic ne@@ ed@@ s.
If you do not pay main@@ ten@@ ance, your childr@@ en@@ :
1. may not have en@@ ough f@@ ood@@ ;
2. may not be able to see a doctor if they are si@@ ck@@ ;
3. if school fees cannot be pa@@ id@@ , may not be able to go to school@@ .
Maintenance ens@@ ures that your children ke@@ ep@@ , as much as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ , the same standard of living as before the parents separ@@ ate@@ d.

The maintenance court will tel@@ l the parent how much is to be pa@@ id@@ , when it is to be pa@@ id@@ , and where it should be pa@@ id@@ .

Each spher@@ e@@ 's responsibi@@ lities are out@@ lin@@ ed in the Con@@ stitu@@ tion.
Provincial government can make and admin@@ ister provincial laws in its areas of juris@@ dic@@ tion (@@ e.g. li@@ quor lic@@ enc@@ es, provincial plann@@ ing, cultural mat@@ ter@@ s, rec@@ re@@ ation, roads and tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ ).
It shar@@ es certain areas with national govern@@ ment, such as health@@ , education and social services.
Local govern@@ ments@@ ' role includes local service deliver@@ y, promo@@ ting a safe and health@@ y environ@@ ment, and promo@@ ting develop@@ ment.
Govern@@ ments have a political and an administrative ar@@ m.
The political arm cre@@ ates the laws and poli@@ ci@@ es.
C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens elec@@ t represent@@ atives to the national par@@ lia@@ ment, the provincial parliament and the local counci@@ l@@ s.
The Administr@@ ative arm is the part of government that imple@@ ments laws and provides services.
It consists of all the Departments (@@ e.g. Health@@ , Agriculture@@ ).

* The Government of South Africa

if you are an own@@ er of a property you are responsible for main@@ taining your pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing in good order and for re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing water le@@ ak@@ s on your property .
the people resid@@ ing on the property , whether it be the own@@ er or the tenant , are responsible for ens@@ uring that they use only the water they need and can af@@ ford .
ho@@ we@@ ver , during the course of this project all hou@@ se@@ hold water le@@ ak@@ s will be re@@ pai@@ red free of charge .
this will be a once off opportun@@ ity .
after the project you will ag@@ ain be responsible

by only using the amount of water you need and can af@@ ford and pay@@ ing your bill month@@ ly you will become a water@@ wise us@@ er .

every month you are supp@@ lied with 6 000 li@@ tre@@ s of c@@ le@@ an water and 4 200 li@@ tre@@ s of was@@ te water is removed free of charge in accordance with national policy n@@ dig@@ ent grant
where the municipal value of your property is less than r@@ 100@@ ,@@ 000 you also have a r@@ 20 indi@@ g@@ ent grant cre@@ di@@ ted to your account .
at current tari@@ ff@@ s the water and se@@ w@@ age bill for 11 kil@@ o@@ li@@ tre@@ s of water is r@@ 20@@ ,@@ 01 inc@@ l v@@ at .
if you live on a property with municipal value less than

how is this different from existing services ?
f@@ aster .
on tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ tes vehicles will have their own lan@@ e , and there will be a regula@@ r , f@@ requ@@ ent , sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led service on fe@@ ed@@ er rou@@ tes .
saf@@ er .
there will be security person@@ nel at the main st@@ ations and there will be cc@@ t@@ v c@@ am@@ er@@ as in the st@@ ations and the vehicles .
security will be a pri@@ ority .
dri@@ ver@@ s will be monit@@ or@@ ed and there will be vehicle trac@@ king to make sure there is no spe@@ eding or rec@@ k@@ less driving and that vehicles will be at the st@@ ations on time .
com@@ for@@ table and acces@@ sible .
the vehicles will be mo@@ der@@ n and c@@ le@@ an , with sp@@ ace for se@@ ated and standing p@@ assen@@ g@@ ers .
the vehicles are also ad@@ ap@@ ted to be acces@@ sible to the el@@ der@@ ly , children and people with dis@@ abili@@ ties and to provide sp@@ ace for wh@@ eel@@ chair@@ s .
sustainable .
low@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion vehicles and more people using public transport ra@@ ther than private car@@ s will offer environmental benefits .
af@@ for@@ d@@ able .
while establish@@ ing the system will cost b@@ illi@@ ons of r@@ and , the aim is to have f@@ ar@@ es that are com@@ par@@ able with those currently char@@ ged .
e@@ as@@ y to use .
a s@@ mar@@ t card system will be used that will al@@ low p@@ assen@@ g@@ ers to transfer from one tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ te to another on a single f@@ are .
these car@@ ds will be wid@@ ely available , at st@@ ations and through other re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers .
what does this me@@ an for p@@ assen@@ g@@ ers ?
the service will r@@ un for f@@ ar longer â during the day , into the even@@ ing and at week@@ ends and will be regula@@ r , f@@ requ@@ ent and re@@ li@@ able .
once the full system is in place , people will be able to tr@@ av@@ el around the c@@ ity to visit f@@ ri@@ ends and family , shop@@ ping centres and pla@@ ces of le@@ is@@ ure , and touris@@ ts will be able to get around e@@ asi@@ ly .
the aim is to have e@@ as@@ y access between the system and other ways of ge@@ tting around , such as w@@ al@@ king , c@@ yc@@ ling , met@@ er@@ ed tax@@ is , and par@@ k-@@ and@@ -@@ ri@@ de facilities .
a non-@@ motor@@ ised transport plan is being developed for each of the st@@ ations .
what does this me@@ an for people in private vehicles ?
where special b@@ us@@ ways are envisaged , some road sp@@ ace will be lo@@ st to private motor@@ is@@ ts , and traffic sign@@ als will pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ se public transport vehicles .
this will encour@@ age people using private car@@ s to s@@ wit@@ ch to using the new system .
the separ@@ ation of public transport from general traffic can be benef@@ ici@@ al to both public transport and car@@ s .
the b@@ us@@ -@@ min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i lan@@ e on the n@@ 2 has sav@@ ed private car@@ s over 20 min@@ u@@ tes in travel@@ ling time .
stre@@ ets where private motor@@ is@@ ts will lo@@ se road sp@@ ace to the new system are parts of the r@@ 27 and in the centre of town at her@@ tz@@ o@@ g bou@@ lev@@ ard , he@@ er@@ en@@ gr@@ ach@@ t , parts of ad@@ der@@ ley street , han@@ s str@@ i@@ j@@ d@@ om a@@ venue and parts of wes@@ tern bou@@ lev@@ ard .
who will r@@ un the system ?
the c@@ ity of cape town will build the special b@@ us@@ ways and speci@@ fy the levels of service , cost of the f@@ ar@@ es and the kin@@ ds of vehicles to be used .
private sector compan@@ ies will provide the ac@@ tual oper@@ ations and services .
the oper@@ ator will be paid on the basis of how many kil@@ om@@ et@@ res the vehicles tr@@ av@@ el and by me@@ eting other performance standards .
there will be a separ@@ ate tender process for an independent company to collec@@ t the f@@ ar@@ es .
there will also be an over@@ si@@ ght ag@@ ency established to monitor the quality of the service and to deal with complaints from the public .
what does this me@@ an for the current oper@@ ators ?
the c@@ ity of cape town is t@@ al@@ king to represent@@ atives of the b@@ us and min@@ i@@ b@@ us industry in order to ensure that they pla@@ y a c@@ entral role in the new system .
the objec@@ tive is to achi@@ eve a high quality of service while impro@@ ving pro@@ f@@ it@@ ability and working conditions in the industry .
what does this me@@ an for workers in the industry ?
the new system is exp@@ ected to create many j@@ ob@@ s , not j@@ ust in the con@@ struction phase but also in the oper@@ ations .
working for the new system will me@@ an permanent j@@ ob@@ s with all the benefits of form@@ al employment , such as job security , regula@@ r hours of work , pre@@ dic@@ table income , leave , si@@ ck leave and ma@@ ternity benefits .
the new system will have many benefits for workers in the industry .
where is the money for this project com@@ ing from ?
the system is being fin@@ anc@@ ed through support from national government and the c@@ ity of cape town .
all three spher@@ es of government , including the wes@@ tern cape provincial government , are commit@@ ted to transform@@ ing public transport in cape town .
much of the funding is being made available to meet the cape town@@ s requirements for ho@@ sting the 2010 world cu@@ p .
when will all this happ@@ en and how will it affec@@ t me ?
all the phase 1@@ a rou@@ tes are plan@@ ned to be oper@@ ating by mar@@ ch 2010 , which will al@@ low time to i@@ ro@@ n out the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able te@@ eth@@ ing problems by the time the world cu@@ p beg@@ ins in jun@@ e .
from the end of 2008 , con@@ struction work can be exp@@ ected on the main parts of the rou@@ te â especially in the c@@ ity centre and on the gre@@ en poin@@ t / se@@ a poin@@ t rou@@ te and between the c@@ ity and b@@ a@@ ysi@@ de mall , al@@ ong b@@ laa@@ uw@@ berg road and up to the d@@ u no@@ on area .
car@@ ef@@ ul planning is being done to minim@@ ise any traffic imp@@ acts during con@@ struction .
how can i get more information ?
er@@ m has been appointed by the c@@ ity to eng@@ age the communities that will be directly affected by phase 1@@ a .
in late 2008 they will be contac@@ ting represent@@ atives of these communities and hol@@ ding public events to ex@@ pla@@ in the pro@@ pos@@ als in more det@@ ail .
if you are inter@@ ested in being involved in these public processes , please contact lin@@ da sla@@ b@@ ber by ph@@ on@@ ing 021 70@@ 2 9@@ 100 or by em@@ ail@@ ing lin@@ da@@ .@@ sla@@ b@@ ber @ er@@ m@@ .com .
the ir@@ t is a way of ens@@ uring that all mo@@ des of public transport work together and have pri@@ ority over private transport .
a maj@@ or part of this is a b@@ us rap@@ id tran@@ sit system â a f@@ ast , mo@@ der@@ n road@@ -@@ based system .
cape town@@ s ir@@ t system will be based on exam@@ ples of rap@@ id tran@@ sit systems that are working well in many parts of the world , including l@@ ati@@ n am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , asi@@ a , nor@@ th am@@ er@@ ic@@ a and a@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ a .
it can work well here to@@ o , gi@@ ving cap@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ ans a regula@@ r , f@@ requ@@ ent , f@@ ast and re@@ li@@ able form of public transport .
how will the ir@@ t work ?
there will be two parts to the service :
tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ tes
fe@@ ed@@ er rou@@ tes
on the tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ tes there will be separ@@ ate , de@@ dic@@ ated b@@ us@@ ways for special 18@@ -@@ me@@ tr@@ e arti@@ cu@@ lated vehicles .
there will be we@@ a@@ ther@@ proof , enc@@ lo@@ sed st@@ ations in the centre of the road on these rou@@ tes , which will ensure that the vehicles can mo@@ ve qu@@ ick@@ ly p@@ ast other traffic and that people can w@@ ai@@ t in safety and com@@ for@@ t .
the fe@@ ed@@ er services , with sh@@ or@@ ter 8@@ m and 12@@ m vehicles , will car@@ ry people to the tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ tes in normal traffic with st@@ ations al@@ ong the side of the road .
each vehicle will have se@@ veral wi@@ de d@@ oor@@ s that open level with the station plat@@ form so that lo@@ ts of people can get in and out qu@@ ick@@ ly .
the service will oper@@ ate for 18 hours a day and vehicles will be f@@ requ@@ ent .
the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cies will range between a few min@@ u@@ tes in pe@@ ak hours and at least three times an h@@ our when there is less de@@ m@@ and .
f@@ ar@@ es will be af@@ for@@ d@@ able and com@@ par@@ able with those char@@ ged by b@@ uses and min@@ i@@ b@@ uses at the mo@@ ment .
where will the system go ?
the c@@ ity of cape town@@ s aim is to establish an ir@@ t net@@ work ac@@ ross the c@@ ity within 10 to 12 years .
the net@@ work will ensure that over 75 of the people are within 500 met@@ ers of a high@@ -@@ quality public transport system .
this can only be achiev@@ ed one ste@@ p at a time .
there are four ph@@ ases for rol@@ ling out the ir@@ t .
the first phase will be done in two ste@@ ps , one to be completed before the world cu@@ p in 2010 and the other soon after the ev@@ ent .
phase 1@@ a : this phase will provide a lin@@ k from the air@@ port to the c@@ ity centre and from the c@@ ity centre to gre@@ en poin@@ t , se@@ a poin@@ t and hou@@ t b@@ ay , and around the c@@ ity bo@@ w@@ l sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s .
phase 1@@ b : the pro@@ posed rou@@ tes will exten@@ d the first phase to include special b@@ us@@ ways to c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y c@@ ity and
m@@ ont@@ ag@@ ue g@@ ard@@ ens and b@@ us@@ ways from the air@@ port to bel@@ l@@ ville and d@@ ur@@ ban@@ ville , strand and g@@ ord@@ ons b@@ ay , c@@ lar@@ em@@ on@@ t and con@@ stan@@ ti@@ a , and table view via c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y c@@ ity .
phase 2 : this phase will lin@@ k the d@@ ens@@ ely pop@@ ula@@ ted south e@@ ast of the c@@ ity , which includes mit@@ ch@@ el@@ ls pla@@ in and k@@ ha@@ ye@@ lits@@ ha , to d@@ est@@ in@@ ations ac@@ ross the pen@@ insula .
ph@@ ases 3 and 4 : the fin@@ al ph@@ ases will exp@@ and and lin@@ k rou@@ tes to the complete net@@ work , including areas such as del@@ f@@ t , b@@ lu@@ e do@@ wn@@ s and stell@@ enbos@@ ch .
what ex@@ ac@@ tly will phase 1@@ a include ?
the ma@@ p has so@@ lid lin@@ es repres@@ enting tr@@ un@@ k rou@@ tes and do@@ t@@ ted lin@@ es sho@@ wing fe@@ ed@@ er rou@@ tes .

new opportunities for the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry
the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry has pla@@ y@@ ed an important role in ke@@ eping the people of cape town on the mo@@ ve .
tax@@ i oper@@ ators sa@@ w an opportun@@ ity in the lack of public transport in town@@ ship areas , and now oper@@ ate ac@@ ross the c@@ ity .
even th@@ ough they di@@ d not receive subsi@@ dies , min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i oper@@ ators have provided custom@@ ised services that other mo@@ des have not been able to offer .
to@@ day , the industry and the market are chan@@ ging .
the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry is fac@@ ed with many pres@@ su@@ res , including ris@@ ing fu@@ el p@@ ric@@ es , ris@@ ing labour costs and competi@@ tion from private car@@ s .
the system en@@ ta@@ il@@ s existing oper@@ ators jo@@ ining for@@ ces to become sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders in new oper@@ ator businesses .
these businesses will provide regula@@ r transport services on designated tr@@ un@@ k and fe@@ ed@@ er rou@@ tes by oper@@ ating and man@@ aging fle@@ ets of new vehicles .
there would be a number of advan@@ t@@ ages , including :
pre@@ dic@@ table income , because the state will pay the oper@@ ators per kil@@ om@@ et@@ res travel@@ led ra@@ ther than for the number of p@@ assen@@ g@@ ers car@@ ri@@ ed
de@@ dic@@ ated lan@@ es , en@@ ab@@ ling more r@@ un@@ s in the b@@ us@@ y pe@@ ak perio@@ ds good working conditions for employees , with better pay , training , sh@@ or@@ ter hours and more c@@ are@@ er opportunities
a bi@@ g@@ ger market for public transport as people s@@ wit@@ ch from private car@@ s to the new system
the new system offers existing oper@@ ators an opportun@@ ity to gro@@ w their businesses , and participate in a new system that will change our c@@ ity for the better .
the c@@ ity of cape town se@@ es those min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i and b@@ us oper@@ ators who@@ se services will be up@@ gra@@ ded by the ir@@ t , as pre@@ fer@@ red part@@ ners .
already , oper@@ ators in the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry have star@@ ted to gro@@ w and di@@ versi@@ fy their businesses , taking up opportunities in tourism , and lear@@ ner and stud@@ ent transport .
some have even exp@@ an@@ ded into related industr@@ ies , including fu@@ el st@@ ations , vehicle de@@ al@@ ers@@ hi@@ ps , parts and maintenance .
the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry is mat@@ uring , and the entrepreneurs who le@@ ad it have sho@@ wn that they can build and exp@@ and their businesses .
as the c@@ ity of cape town mo@@ ves a@@ head with integrated rap@@ id tran@@ sit , it is loo@@ king for a str@@ ong part@@ nership with existing oper@@ ators in planning and developing the system , and ulti@@ m@@ ately be@@ com@@ ing the oper@@ ators of the new service .
the existing min@@ i@@ b@@ us and b@@ us industr@@ ies must have a vo@@ ice in sh@@ ap@@ ing the new system .
their ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se will be important in deliver@@ ing a quality product to the custom@@ er .
increas@@ ed pro@@ f@@ it@@ ability
the new system will deli@@ ver increas@@ ed pro@@ f@@ it@@ ability for oper@@ ators .
this will be achiev@@ ed through de@@ dic@@ ated lan@@ es , a better fu@@ el econ@@ omy , bul@@ k bu@@ ying of new kin@@ ds of vehicles and parts , and coordin@@ ated marketing and adver@@ ti@@ sing to at@@ tract new custom@@ ers .
a level pla@@ ying field
the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry has ne@@ ver received oper@@ ating subsi@@ dies from government .
there has long been a s@@ ense of un@@ fair@@ ness , as some oper@@ ators are comp@@ ens@@ ated , while oth@@ ers are not .
in the new business mo@@ del , all oper@@ ators will be treated equ@@ ally on a level pla@@ ying field .
in addi@@ tion , government will provide capital subsi@@ dies to all .

a better way of mo@@ ving people transform@@ ing transport in cape town
the c@@ ity of cape town is pro@@ pos@@ ing to make f@@ ar@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing changes to the c@@ it@@ ys transport system with the intro@@ duction of the integrated rap@@ id tran@@ sit system .
the c@@ ity of cape town is eng@@ aging with min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i oper@@ ators to form a part@@ nership to make this a re@@ ality .
min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ is ke@@ ep cape town mo@@ ving
the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry has pla@@ y@@ ed an important and histor@@ ic role in mo@@ ving the people of cape town .
the industry is the cri@@ tical lin@@ k ens@@ uring that ordinary people and low@@ -@@ income communities access j@@ ob@@ s and other opportunities throughout the c@@ ity .
while the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry gre@@ w des@@ pi@@ te the diffic@@ ul@@ ties experi@@ enc@@ ed during the ap@@ ar@@ theid er@@ a , it has continu@@ ed to contribu@@ te to south african soci@@ ety up to the present day , and will no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t continue to do so .
in addi@@ tion to the v@@ ital transport services the industry provides , it is also a lar@@ ge employer , and many fam@@ i@@ lies and communities dep@@ end on the industry for their li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood .
with its important histor@@ y and contribu@@ tion to the local econ@@ omy , the c@@ ity of cape town wan@@ ts all existing oper@@ ators to participate in and benefit from the new system .
an example of a tr@@ un@@ k b@@ us .
phase 1@@ a : 2008 â mar@@ ch 2010
the first phase is a pil@@ ot or de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation phase for the rest of the project , and foc@@ uses on the areas of the c@@ ity that need special transport services for the 2010 fi@@ f@@ a world c@@ up@@ t@@ m .
this phase will serve as a way to test oper@@ ations , and make necessary ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments .
it will also give the industry ac@@ ross the c@@ ity an opportun@@ ity to see how the system will work , and the range of opportunities it offers for the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry as a who@@ le .
this will include a lin@@ k from the air@@ port to the c@@ ity centre , and from the c@@ ity centre to gre@@ en poin@@ t , se@@ a poin@@ t and hou@@ t b@@ ay , and around the c@@ ity bo@@ w@@ l sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s .
there will be a rou@@ te up the w@@ est co@@ ast to b@@ a@@ ysi@@ de mall , the full system .

chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing the industry
more con@@ ges@@ tion
more con@@ ges@@ tion means s@@ low@@ er spe@@ eds for public transport .
in tur@@ n , the s@@ low spe@@ eds increase costs , such as fu@@ el costs and we@@ ar and te@@ ar on the vehicles .
con@@ ges@@ tion also mak@@ es tr@@ av@@ el times longer for custom@@ ers , which dis@@ cour@@ ages public transport use .
be under th@@ re@@ at over the com@@ ing dec@@ ades as private vehicle own@@ ership increas@@ es .
unless the quality of public transport is dr@@ am@@ ati@@ cally increas@@ ed , cap@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ ans will continue f@@ loc@@ king to private car@@ s at an ever@@ -@@ f@@ aster rate .
already , there are more than a million car@@ s in cape town , appro@@ xim@@ ately one c@@ ar for every three people .
supp@@ ly .
this will continue to dri@@ ve up the p@@ ric@@ e of o@@ il .
also , south africa is a net im@@ por@@ ter of o@@ il , produc@@ ing only a li@@ mited amount of o@@ il our@@ sel@@ ves , making us dependent on o@@ il produc@@ ers in other parts of the world .
this will continue to place pres@@ sure on our econ@@ omy into the fu@@ ture , cal@@ ling for more efficient use of this li@@ mited natural resource .
more car@@ s , less public transport
each year , private c@@ ar own@@ ership is increas@@ ing in cape town .
as in@@ comes increase , more people are ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing public transport for private car@@ s .
if the current tr@@ end continu@@ es , the very exis@@ ten@@ ce of the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry will increas@@ ing private c@@ ar own@@ ership in cape town , between 2001 and 2007 .
un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table fu@@ el costs
over the last months , the cost of fu@@ el has increas@@ ed consider@@ ably as a result of increas@@ ing o@@ il p@@ ric@@ es and the we@@ ak r@@ and .
all indi@@ cations are that the p@@ ric@@ e of o@@ il and p@@ etro@@ l will continue to r@@ ise .
many anal@@ y@@ sts be@@ li@@ eve that the ex@@ trac@@ tion of o@@ il from the ear@@ th has re@@ ached its pe@@ ak , and that de@@ m@@ and for o@@ il will begin to ex@@ ce@@ ed
permit problems
the permit@@ ting system for the min@@ i@@ b@@ us tax@@ i industry is not working as well as it should .
currently , the per@@ c@@ ep@@ tion is that some rou@@ tes are over@@ tra@@ ded , with to@@ o many permits issued .
on the other hand , the wa@@ it@@ ing time for the process@@ ing of applications is very long .

the integrated co@@ ast@@ al
management bill
a brief guide to assist the public participation process environment & tourism department :
environmental af@@ fairs and tourism
parliament requi@@ res the public@@ ation for public com@@ ment of b@@ ills in the government ga@@ z@@ ette before such b@@ ills are intro@@ duced in parliament for the purpose of pro@@ m@@ ul@@ g@@ ating them as leg@@ ally bin@@ ding acts .
this is in line with the constitutional im@@ per@@ atives that government ens@@ ures accoun@@ t@@ ability , respon@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and op@@ enn@@ ess .
during the first week of dec@@ ember 2006 the cabinet approved the public@@ ation in the government ga@@ z@@ ette of the integrated co@@ ast@@ al management bill for public com@@ ment .
in a pres@@ s rele@@ ase issued on 8 dec@@ ember 2006 , mar@@ th@@ in@@ us van sch@@ alk@@ wy@@ k , the minister of environmental af@@ fairs & tourism , ann@@ oun@@ ced that the bill would be ga@@ z@@ et@@ ted on 15 dec@@ ember 2006 .
the minister poin@@ ted out that due to its comple@@ x@@ ity the bill would be available for public com@@ ment for a period of 90 days .
the text of the bill is available from the government prin@@ ter or can be do@@ wn@@ lo@@ a@@ ded from htt@@ p : / / www.@@ de@@ at@@ .gov.za / .
the purpose of this guide is to facilitate me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and inform@@ ed public participation during the 90 day com@@ ments period .
the guide se@@ eks to achi@@ eve this by first ex@@ pla@@ ining the histor@@ ical con@@ text le@@ ading to the public@@ ation in 2000 of the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er for sustainable co@@ ast@@ al development in south africa which provided a national policy for man@@ aging our co@@ ast@@ line .
this guide then bri@@ ef@@ ly ex@@ plain@@ s the purpose of each chapter of the bill and provides an out@@ line of its content .
when the bill becomes an act of parliament south africa will for the first time have a national co@@ ast@@ al management act in place for man@@ aging our co@@ ast@@ al z@@ one , a p@@ ric@@ el@@ ess national ass@@ et .
the public@@ ation of the bill for com@@ ment therefore repres@@ ents a histor@@ ical opportun@@ ity for co@@ ast@@ al stakeholders , inter@@ ested and affected parties and members of the general public to help sh@@ ap@@ e the content of the pro@@ posed integrated co@@ ast@@ al management act .
wh@@ y is there a need for a national co@@ ast@@ al management act ?
the ques@@ tions are often ra@@ ised â wh@@ y is there a need for de@@ dic@@ ated co@@ ast@@ al management legislation â is the co@@ ast not si@@ mp@@ ly part of the general environment and is it not already cover@@ ed by existing environmental legislation ?
an@@ sw@@ ers to these ques@@ tions are disc@@ uss@@ ed below .
the co@@ ast is a uni@@ qu@@ e part of the environment .
it is the me@@ eting place of the land and se@@ a â a li@@ mited sp@@ ati@@ al area that sup@@ ports many human activities .
the co@@ ast is a di@@ st@@ inc@@ tive system in which a range of consider@@ ations â bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cal , economic , social and in@@ stitutional â inter@@ con@@ nec@@ t , in a manner which requi@@ res a de@@ dic@@ ated and integrated management appro@@ ach .
the co@@ ast needs to be man@@ aged as a system in order to make op@@ ti@@ mal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides .
ho@@ we@@ ver , this system â ori@@ ent@@ ated appro@@ ach has f@@ ailed to materi@@ ali@@ z@@ e to date and various sec@@ tors of government continue to adop@@ t a management appro@@ ach foc@@ using on their specific sec@@ tors such as land@@ -@@ use planning , agric@@ ulture , water af@@ fairs , nature cons@@ erv@@ ation and oth@@ ers .
this bill promo@@ tes a ho@@ li@@ stic way of th@@ in@@ king by promo@@ ting coordin@@ ated and integrated co@@ ast@@ al management , which view@@ s the co@@ ast as a system and em@@ ph@@ asi@@ z@@ es the import@@ ance of man@@ aging it as such .
in the p@@ ast , the value of co@@ ast@@ al ec@@ o@@ systems as a cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one for development was not suff@@ ici@@ ently ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged in deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making in south africa .
the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er high@@ ligh@@ ts the import@@ ance of recogn@@ ising the value of the co@@ ast .
the value of the direct benefits obtained from co@@ ast@@ al goods and services was esti@@ m@@ ated in 1998 to be about r@@ 16@@ 8 b@@ illi@@ on an@@ nu@@ ally , which was equi@@ val@@ ent to about 35 of our annual gro@@ ss domestic product .
much of the we@@ alth loc@@ ked up in our co@@ ast continu@@ es to be was@@ ted due to environ@@ ment@@ ally ins@@ ensi@@ tive development and activities .
economic and social opportunities for we@@ alth cre@@ ation and equ@@ ity are being mis@@ sed and co@@ ast@@ al ec@@ o@@ systems are being deg@@ ra@@ ded .
pho@@ to : de@@ at
pho@@ to : c@@ si@@ r natural resources and the environment
how we manage our co@@ ast@@ al areas will determine whether they remain valu@@ able ass@@ ets or become deg@@ ra@@ ded li@@ abili@@ ties .
the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er also em@@ ph@@ asi@@ z@@ es the import@@ ance of facilit@@ ating co@@ ast@@ al development which is sustainable .
this requi@@ res development to be ec@@ o@@ log@@ ically , soci@@ ally and econom@@ ically sustainable .
for co@@ ast@@ al development to be ec@@ o@@ log@@ ically sustainable , it should invol@@ ve protection of co@@ ast@@ al ec@@ o@@ systems and sustainable use of mar@@ ine and co@@ ast@@ al resources .
for co@@ ast@@ al development to be soci@@ ally sustainable , it should em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se public awareness and shar@@ ed responsibility , em@@ pow@@ ering disadvantaged individu@@ als and communities , including women and the poor .
for co@@ ast@@ al development to be econom@@ ically sustainable it should di@@ versi@@ fy opportunities , provide j@@ ob@@ s and facilitate access to productive resources .
the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er di@@ d not mer@@ ely provide a vision , principles , go@@ als and objec@@ tives for co@@ ast@@ al management in south africa .
it took a ste@@ p further by providing a plan of action which out@@ lin@@ es in det@@ ail how the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er is to be implemen@@ ted .
one of the ele@@ ments of this plan of action is in@@ stitutional and legal development .
after the cabinet approved the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er a com@@ prehensive legal review was car@@ ri@@ ed out .
its purpose was to determine whether the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er could be implemen@@ ted in terms of existing laws .
the review conclu@@ ded that a de@@ dic@@ ated co@@ ast@@ al management act was required for implementing the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er .
the cont@@ ents of the bill
pre@@ am@@ ble
the pre@@ am@@ ble ex@@ plain@@ s the r@@ ation@@ ale or basis for pro@@ m@@ ul@@ g@@ ating the pro@@ posed integrated co@@ ast@@ al management act .
se@@ veral fac@@ tors form@@ ing part of this basis are disc@@ uss@@ ed above .
chapter 1 : inter@@ p@@ ret@@ ation , objec@@ tives and application of act
this chapter defin@@ es important word@@ s and terms , s@@ ets out the objec@@ tives of the pro@@ posed act in order to guide the inter@@ p@@ ret@@ ation and application of the act , c@@ l@@ ari@@ fi@@ es the role of the state in rel@@ ation to the co@@ ast@@ al environment , indic@@ ates to whom and where the act applies and ex@@ plain@@ s that the act must be re@@ ad in con@@ jun@@ c@@ tion with the national environmental management act and ex@@ plain@@ s how to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le conflic@@ ts with other legislation .
chapter 2 : the co@@ ast@@ al z@@ one
the bill foc@@ uses on regula@@ ting human activities within , or that affec@@ t the co@@ ast@@ al z@@ one .
the co@@ ast@@ al z@@ one is ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ated in fi@@ g@@ ure 1 and defined as the area com@@ pris@@ ing co@@ ast@@ al public property , the co@@ ast@@ al bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one , co@@ ast@@ al access land , specially protec@@ ted co@@ ast@@ al areas , and includes any a@@ spec@@ t of the environment on , in and above them .
at the he@@ ar@@ t of the co@@ ast@@ al z@@ one is an area of land and water defined as co@@ ast@@ al public property , which is the common property of the people of south africa .
this con@@ tra@@ sts with the current situ@@ ation under the se@@ as@@ h@@ ore act where the se@@ as@@ h@@ ore and se@@ a are own@@ ed by the president on behalf of the peop@@ le@@ .co@@ ast@@ al public property is made up pri@@ mar@@ ily of the se@@ as@@ h@@ ore and co@@ ast@@ al wa@@ ters .
die beper@@ king of beheer van ontwikkeling in hierdie areas is ook nood@@ saaklik ten einde die din@@ am@@ iese aard van die kus in ag te neem en om mense en eiendom te beskerm teen ska@@ de weens natuur@@ like oor@@ sake , soos k@@ us@@ ly@@ ner@@ o@@ sie en vlo@@ ede , of nuwe bed@@ re@@ i@@ gings soos die st@@ y@@ ging van se@@ ev@@ la@@ kke as gevolg van aar@@ d@@ ver@@ h@@ it@@ ting .
the bill provides that initi@@ ally the co@@ ast@@ al bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one would exten@@ d one h@@ un@@ d@@ red met@@ res in@@ land from the b@@ ound@@ ary of co@@ ast@@ al public property in areas that have already been z@@ on@@ ed for res@@ identi@@ al , comm@@ ercial , indus@@ trial or multi@@ ple@@ -@@ use purposes , and one kil@@ ome@@ tr@@ e in@@ land in other areas .
for example , in developed areas where the co@@ ast@@ al environment has been high@@ ly modified , such as d@@ ur@@ b@@ ans be@@ ach@@ f@@ ron@@ t and se@@ a poin@@ t in cape town , the wid@@ th of the co@@ ast@@ al bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one could be re@@ duced to less than 100 met@@ res .
in order to sec@@ ure public access to co@@ ast@@ al public property , the bill requi@@ res municipalities to design@@ ate co@@ ast@@ al access land .
certain land will be regar@@ ded as co@@ ast@@ al access land when the bill is enacted but the design@@ ation of co@@ ast@@ al access land may also be with@@ dra@@ wn or canc@@ el@@ led .
reasons for with@@ dra@@ wing such design@@ ation could include in@@ stan@@ ces where the use of co@@ ast@@ al access land is ca@@ using dam@@ age to the environment .
the process for design@@ ating or with@@ dra@@ wing the design@@ ation of co@@ ast@@ al access land is descri@@ bed in section 19 .
the responsibi@@ lities of municipalities with regard to co@@ ast@@ al access land are descri@@ bed in section 20 .
in the p@@ ast infrastructure for access to the se@@ a was often developed without suff@@ icient consider@@ ation of environmental fac@@ tors .
early dr@@ af@@ ts of the integrated co@@ ast@@ al management bill inclu@@ ded det@@ ailed provisions de@@ aling with co@@ ast@@ al protec@@ ted areas .
ho@@ we@@ ver , it was deci@@ ded that co@@ ast@@ al protec@@ ted areas would gener@@ ally be man@@ aged under the protec@@ ted areas act ra@@ ther than the pro@@ posed integrated co@@ ast@@ al management act .
protec@@ ted areas or parts there@@ of are automati@@ cally inclu@@ ded in the bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one in terms of section 16 .
the purpose of section 22 is to en@@ able the me@@ c to dec@@ l@@ are that protec@@ ted areas or parts there@@ of are not part of the bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one .
section 23 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 de@@ als with the management of such areas .
this is inten@@ ded to provide a mechanis@@ m for establish@@ ing special management arran@@ ge@@ ments in a particular area in order to give effect to the rec@@ ogni@@ tion in the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er that the diversity of the co@@ ast requi@@ res different management appro@@ ach@@ es in different areas .
a special management area could be declared for various co@@ ast@@ al management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established main@@ ly to encour@@ age sustainable development in particular areas , ra@@ ther than as cons@@ erv@@ ation areas .
for example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable har@@ v@@ esting of sh@@ ell@@ fish for subsi@@ st@@ ence purposes in areas where such har@@ v@@ esting is pres@@ ently de@@ pl@@ eting the sh@@ ell@@ fish resources .
section 25 author@@ is@@ es m@@ ec@@ s to establish co@@ ast@@ al s@@ et@@ back lin@@ es .
once such a line has been established in a z@@ on@@ ing schem@@ e , any person who wis@@ h@@ es to er@@ ec@@ t or al@@ ter a structure situ@@ ated se@@ a@@ ward of the line must ob@@ tain per@@ mission before do@@ ing so .
a co@@ ast@@ al s@@ et@@ back line may , for example , be established to ensure that the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ s from high buil@@ dings do not f@@ all on the be@@ ach or in order to take into account possible effec@@ ts of se@@ a level r@@ ise .
chapter 3 : b@@ ound@@ aries of co@@ ast@@ al areas
this chapter provides procedures for de@@ mar@@ c@@ ating and ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ing the b@@ ound@@ aries of co@@ ast@@ al public property , the co@@ ast@@ al bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one , special management areas and co@@ ast@@ al access land .
it also s@@ ets out the consider@@ ations which must apply in respect of such de@@ mar@@ cations and ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments .
de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation procedures to change the b@@ ound@@ aries of the co@@ ast@@ al bu@@ ff@@ er z@@ one are only li@@ kel@@ y to be institu@@ ted where the area designated by the act is in@@ appropriate and imp@@ ed@@ es effective co@@ ast@@ al management .

People of South Africa : 
When she di@@ ed , we k@@ new that M@@ ama Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de T@@ amb@@ o had been rec@@ ently dis@@ char@@ ged from hospital . 
B@@ ut because we also k@@ new that she had the ten@@ ac@@ ity of sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t and streng@@ th of will to sol@@ di@@ er on among the living , we had inten@@ ded to wel@@ come her and other members of her family as our gu@@ ests on this a@@ ug@@ ust occ@@ asi@@ on . 
B@@ ut that was not to be . 
T@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w we will pay her our last respec@@ ts as we in@@ ter her remain@@ s . 
Th@@ us she will only be with us in sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t when in October this year , we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the 90@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the birth of her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , the fa@@ ther of her children , her compan@@ ion , her com@@ rade , and an em@@ in@@ ent s@@ on of our people , O@@ li@@ ver Reg@@ in@@ al@@ d T@@ amb@@ o . 
Once more , we con@@ ve@@ y our con@@ do@@ l@@ ences to the T@@ amb@@ o family . 
H@@ is death was as sho@@ c@@ king and m@@ ys@@ teri@@ ous as his life was a lo@@ des@@ ta@@ r poin@@ ting us to the fre@@ edom we en@@ jo@@ y to@@ day . 
I fe@@ el im@@ men@@ sel@@ y pro@@ u@@ d that demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c South Africa has had the s@@ ense and s@@ ensi@@ tiv@@ ity to ac@@ knowledge what Albert L@@ u@@ th@@ ul@@ i and O@@ li@@ ver T@@ amb@@ o me@@ an to our n@@ ation by nam@@ ing two of our National Or@@ ders after them - the Or@@ der of L@@ u@@ th@@ ul@@ i , and the Or@@ der of the Comp@@ an@@ i@@ ons of O@@ .@@ R . 
I also know of the gre@@ at pri@@ de f@@ el@@ t by those who have been ad@@ mitted into the ran@@ ks of the em@@ in@@ ent National Or@@ ders . 
I am also ple@@ ased to wel@@ come to the Hou@@ se the acti@@ vis@@ ts of the 19@@ 5@@ 6 W@@ o@@ mens March and the 19@@ 76 So@@ wet@@ o U@@ pris@@ ing who are sitting in the Presid@@ ents bo@@ x , as well as the em@@ in@@ ent pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts from all our provinces , pro@@ posed by our Provincial Spe@@ ak@@ ers to jo@@ in the group of important gu@@ ests who have jo@@ in@@ ed us to@@ day . 
The government of the people of South Africa on who@@ se behalf I spe@@ ak here to@@ day , as I have been pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to do in previous years , was form@@ ed in 2004 , after the General Elec@@ tions of that year . 
At its annual January L@@ ek@@ go@@ t@@ l@@ a or Bos@@ ber@@ aad last month , the National Cabinet that stand@@ s at the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le of the system of govern@@ ance over which we are pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to pres@@ ide , reflec@@ ted on the f@@ act that its me@@ eting mark@@ ed the mid@@ -@@ term of the life of the government bor@@ n of our last , 2004 , elec@@ tions . 
H@@ av@@ ing under@@ st@@ ood this , it was natural that we should put the ques@@ tion to our@@ sel@@ ves â what progres@@ s have we made in the qu@@ est to achi@@ eve the objec@@ tives to which we hon@@ est@@ ly to@@ ld the n@@ ation we were commit@@ ted , as a result of which our people ga@@ ve us the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming authority to g@@ over@@ n our country from 2004 until the next elec@@ tions in 2009 ! 
Wit@@ h your ind@@ ul@@ gen@@ ce , I would like to ste@@ p further back , and rec@@ all what we said , in 2004 , as represent@@ atives of our people , in the pres@@ ence of our f@@ ri@@ ends from the rest of the world , con@@ ven@@ ed at our se@@ at of government the Uni@@ on Buil@@ dings in T@@ sh@@ wan@@ e on F@@ re@@ edom Day , the 10@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of our li@@ ber@@ ation , and particip@@ ated in the In@@ a@@ ug@@ ur@@ ation of the President of the Republic , whom our Parliament had ch@@ os@@ en , respec@@ ting the will of the people demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ cally de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated during the 2004 elec@@ tions . 
On that occ@@ asi@@ on we said in part : 
For to@@ o long our country contain@@ ed within it and repres@@ ented much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety 
It was a place in which to be bor@@ n black was to in@@ her@@ it a lif@@ el@@ ong cur@@ se . 
It was a place in which to be bor@@ n wh@@ i@@ te was to car@@ ry a permanent bur@@ den of fe@@ ar and h@@ id@@ den r@@ age 
It was a place in which s@@ qu@@ al@@ or , the st@@ en@@ ch of p@@ over@@ ty , the open se@@ w@@ ers , the dec@@ a@@ ying ro@@ t , the mil@@ ling c@@ ro@@ w@@ ds of w@@ ret@@ ch@@ ed@@ ness , the un@@ ending im@@ ages of a land@@ s@@ cape stre@@ wn with car@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed ref@@ use , assum@@ ed an a@@ spec@@ t that se@@ em@@ ed necessary to en@@ h@@ ance the be@@ au@@ ty of another world of ti@@ dy stre@@ ets , and w@@ oo@@ ded lan@@ es , and f@@ low@@ ers blo@@ ss@@ oms off@@ s@@ etting the gre@@ en and sing@@ ing gr@@ as@@ s , and bir@@ ds and hou@@ ses fit for kings and qu@@ een@@ s , and ly@@ ric@@ al musi@@ c , and lo@@ ve . 
It was a place in which to live in some pla@@ ces was to in@@ vi@@ te oth@@ ers to pre@@ y on you or to con@@ de@@ m@@ n on@@ es@@ el@@ f to pre@@ y on oth@@ ers , guar@@ ante@@ ed n@@ eighbour@@ s who could not but f@@ all vic@@ ti@@ m to al@@ cohol and dr@@ ug stu@@ por@@ s that would d@@ ul@@ l the pa@@ in of living , who k@@ new that their li@@ ves would not be normal without m@@ ur@@ der in their mid@@ st , and rap@@ e and bru@@ tal personal war@@ s without a c@@ ause . 
It was a place in which to live in other n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds was to en@@ jo@@ y safety and security because to be safe was to be protec@@ ted by high w@@ al@@ ls , elec@@ tri@@ fied f@@ ences , gu@@ ard do@@ gs , police pat@@ ro@@ ls and mi@@ li@@ tary reg@@ i@@ ments ready to def@@ end those who were our mas@@ ters , with gun@@ s and tan@@ ks and air@@ craft that would ra@@ in death on those who would di@@ st@@ ur@@ b the pe@@ ace of the mas@@ ters 
We have ga@@ ther@@ ed here to@@ day , on F@@ re@@ edom Day , because in time , our people , together with the b@@ illi@@ ons of human be@@ ings ac@@ ross the glo@@ be , who are our com@@ rad@@ es@@ -@@ in-@@ arms and whom our di@@ st@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed gu@@ ests repres@@ ent , deci@@ ded to sa@@ y â an end to all that ! 
We are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged that our General Elec@@ tions of a for@@ t@@ ni@@ ght ag@@ o confir@@ med the determin@@ ation of all our people , regar@@ d@@ less of r@@ ace , col@@ our and eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am 
N@@ one of the gre@@ at social problems we have to sol@@ ve is capable of resolution outside the con@@ text of the cre@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of p@@ over@@ ty . 
The work to create that South Africa has beg@@ un . 
Th@@ at work will continue during our Sec@@ ond De@@ ca@@ de of F@@ re@@ edom . 
F@@ if@@ ty years before , as they prepar@@ ed to con@@ ven@@ e the Con@@ gres@@ s of the People , which adopted the F@@ re@@ edom Char@@ ter , the pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts of the day had said , L@@ et us spe@@ ak together , all of us together â African and E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an , In@@ di@@ an and Col@@ ou@@ red all the people of South Africa L@@ et us spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom . 
And of the happ@@ in@@ ess that can come to m@@ en and women if they live in a land that is free . 
We must to@@ day r@@ ene@@ w our ple@@ dge , to spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom , to act in part@@ nership to re@@ ali@@ se the happ@@ in@@ ess for all that should come with li@@ ber@@ ty , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am , to sa@@ y , together , in action â en@@ ough of ever@@ y@@ thing that made our country to cont@@ ain within it and repres@@ ent much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety ! 
We must continue to respon@@ d to the per@@ spec@@ tive we spo@@ ke of as the present government beg@@ an its term of office , fully cons@@ ci@@ ous that n@@ one of the gre@@ at social problems we have to sol@@ ve is capable of resolution outside the con@@ text of the cre@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of p@@ over@@ ty , and therefore that the str@@ ug@@ g@@ le to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate p@@ over@@ ty has been and will continue to be a c@@ entral part of the national ef@@ for@@ t to build the new South Africa . 
Res@@ p@@ ond@@ ing to the im@@ per@@ ative to mo@@ ve for@@ ward as qu@@ ick@@ ly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dre@@ am , our government commit@@ ted it@@ self , working with all South Afric@@ ans , to imple@@ ment det@@ ailed programmes inten@@ ded : 
to ra@@ ise the rate of inves@@ tment in the Fir@@ st Economy ; 
to improve our export performance , foc@@ us@@ sing on services and manufac@@ tu@@ red goods ; 
to increase sp@@ ending on scientific research and development ; 
to imple@@ ment det@@ ailed programmes to respon@@ d to the chall@@ eng@@ es of the Sec@@ ond Economy ; 
to imple@@ ment programmes to ensure bro@@ ad@@ -@@ based black economic em@@ powerment ; 
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objec@@ tives of p@@ over@@ ty alle@@ vi@@ ation ; 
to exp@@ and access to such services as water , elec@@ tricity and sanit@@ ation ; 
to improve the health pro@@ fi@@ le of the n@@ ation as a who@@ le ; 
to inten@@ si@@ fy the housing programme ; 
to imple@@ ment additional measures to open wid@@ er the d@@ oor@@ s of learning and of culture ; 
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ; 
to ensure that the public sector dis@@ char@@ ges its responsibi@@ lities as a cri@@ tical pla@@ y@@ er in the growth , re@@ con@@ struction and development of our country ; 
to acceler@@ ate the process of renew@@ al of the African contin@@ ent ; 
increas@@ ing@@ ly to contribu@@ te to the resolution of maj@@ or ques@@ tions fac@@ ing pe@@ opl@@ es of the world . 
At an a@@ ver@@ age of over 4@@ ,@@ 5 , the rate of growth of our econ@@ omy over the p@@ ast two and hal@@ f years has been at its high@@ est sin@@ ce we at@@ tained our demo@@ cracy in 1994 . 
Inv@@ es@@ tment in the econ@@ omy , by both the public and private sec@@ tors has been increas@@ ing at about 11 , with over@@ all public sector infrastructure sp@@ ending increas@@ ing by an annual a@@ ver@@ age of 15@@ ,@@ 8 . 
To@@ day , fix@@ ed inves@@ tment as a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of Gro@@ ss D@@ om@@ estic Pro@@ duc@@ t â at about 18@@ ,@@ 4 â is at its high@@ est sin@@ ce 199@@ 1 . 
The number of employed people has been increas@@ ing at about hal@@ f@@ -@@ a-@@ million a year in the p@@ ast three years . 
We have se@@ en ste@@ ad@@ y progres@@ s in the advan@@ cement of Black people in the econ@@ omy . 
F@@ ro@@ m ow@@ ning j@@ ust over 3 of the market cap@@ it@@ alisation of the J@@ SE in 2004 , this has increas@@ ed to close on to 5 ; 
and the propor@@ tion of B@@ la@@ c@@ ks in to@@ p management has gro@@ wn from 24 of the total to 27 . 
Y@@ et we must remain concerned that these fi@@ g@@ ures are still w@@ oef@@ ul@@ ly low . 
The advan@@ ces in the econ@@ omy have th@@ ro@@ wn up maj@@ or chall@@ eng@@ es for all of us . 
The m@@ assi@@ ve and sustain@@ ed increase in consum@@ er de@@ m@@ and reflec@@ ts a health@@ y growth in levels of pro@@ sper@@ ity ac@@ ross the pop@@ ulation ; 
and the maj@@ or infrastructure projects that we are emb@@ ar@@ king on de@@ m@@ and m@@ assi@@ ve in@@ put of supp@@ lies and mach@@ in@@ er@@ y . 
B@@ ut our international trade bal@@ ance sho@@ ws that we have not succ@@ ee@@ ded in building the capacity to produce the consum@@ er and capital goods that our country needs . 
Whi@@ le hou@@ se@@ hold deb@@ t has increas@@ ed bro@@ ad@@ ly at the same rate as growth in income , the f@@ act that South Afric@@ ans are sav@@ ing less means that we have to dep@@ end on sav@@ ings from other n@@ ations . 
The continu@@ ing occ@@ asion@@ al vol@@ ati@@ lity of our curr@@ ency has also not bo@@ ded well for our export industr@@ ies . 
O@@ ver the p@@ ast three years , the econ@@ omy has cre@@ ated some on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f million j@@ ob@@ s . 
It is encour@@ aging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 al@@ one , 300 000 of the j@@ ob@@ s cre@@ ated were in the form@@ al sector outside of agric@@ ulture , repres@@ enting a growth rate of about 4 . 
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities cre@@ ated through the Ex@@ pan@@ ded Public Works Programme . 
B@@ ut there is no ques@@ tion that this programme can and must be r@@ at@@ ch@@ e@@ ted up@@ wards qui@@ te sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly . 
There is also no ques@@ tion that we can do much better to create self@@ -@@ employment through small and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es . 
And given that a lar@@ ge majority of the un@@ employed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such inter@@ ven@@ tions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs . 
It is a matter of pri@@ de that , in line with our commit@@ ment to build a car@@ ing soci@@ ety , we have sin@@ ce 2004 impro@@ ved service provision and other a@@ spec@@ ts of the social w@@ age . 
Whi@@ le benef@@ ici@@ aries of social gr@@ ants num@@ ber@@ ed about 8 million in 2004 , to@@ day 11 million poor South Afric@@ ans have access to these gr@@ ants . 
It is encour@@ aging that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the rec@@ ent period , been within man@@ age@@ able ran@@ ges , as the programmes re@@ ach mat@@ urity . 
This will ensure sustain@@ ability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more j@@ ob@@ s and business opportunities . 
The housing programme has se@@ en close to 300 000 new subsi@@ dies allocated in the p@@ ast two years . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , as we s@@ ou@@ ght to improve quality and develop plan@@ s for those who are being mis@@ sed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the p@@ ace of ro@@ ll@@ -@@ out has been much s@@ low@@ er than we exp@@ ected . 
We must act to change this situ@@ ation . 
As H@@ on@@ our@@ able members are aw@@ are , we have over the p@@ ast few years developed and star@@ ted implementing various programmes aimed at impro@@ ving p@@ assen@@ ger transport . 
These include the tax@@ i rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation programme and provincial initi@@ atives such as the Mo@@ lo@@ to R@@ ail Cor@@ rid@@ or in M@@ p@@ um@@ al@@ anga around which fe@@ asi@@ bility work has star@@ ted , the Kli@@ p@@ fontein Cor@@ rid@@ or in Cape Town and the G@@ au@@ tra@@ in project with its lin@@ k@@ ages to the rest of the public transport system . 
These and many other initi@@ atives form part of a com@@ prehensive p@@ assen@@ ger transport strategy , com@@ bin@@ ing both road and r@@ ail . 
We will atten@@ d to the ur@@ g@@ ent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
Access to elec@@ tricity , water and sanit@@ ation has impro@@ ved . 
By 2005 , South Africa had already achiev@@ ed the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ al in respect of basic water supp@@ ly , with impro@@ vement of access from 59 in 1994 to 8@@ 3 in 2006 . 
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that sp@@ end less on mi@@ li@@ tary bud@@ gets than on water and sanit@@ ation . 
In the word@@ s of the UN@@ D@@ P Human Development Report of 2006 : 
South Africa has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanis@@ m for em@@ powerment and a guide to policy Righ@@ ts@@ -@@ based water re@@ form has en@@ abled it to exp@@ and access and over@@ come the leg@@ acy of ra@@ cial in@@ equ@@ ality in@@ her@@ i@@ ted from ap@@ ar@@ theid , part@@ ly through righ@@ ts@@ -@@ based entit@@ le@@ ments . 
We should in@@ de@@ ed c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate this gre@@ at achiev@@ e@@ ment . 
B@@ ut it is a f@@ act that 8 million people are still without po@@ table water . 
M@@ any more are without elec@@ tricity and sanit@@ ation . 
We are pro@@ u@@ d that within one year , we have been able to re@@ duce the bac@@ k@@ lo@@ g in the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of the b@@ uc@@ k@@ et system in established sett@@ le@@ ments by al@@ most hal@@ f . 
We are on course to put an end to this de@@ h@@ um@@ anis@@ ing system in these areas by the end of this year . 
We will continue to conf@@ ron@@ t these chall@@ eng@@ es so as to er@@ ase in our country that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive so that together we can spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom and the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with li@@ ber@@ ty . 
An examin@@ ation of education and skills ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion sho@@ ws impro@@ vement of qui@@ te a high b@@ ase by 2004 , th@@ ough at a s@@ low p@@ ace . 
This applies to liter@@ acy levels , gro@@ ss school en@@ rol@@ ment and tertiary participation rates . 
The flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating Ma@@ tric pas@@ s rates do indic@@ ate that much more needs to be done to st@@ abili@@ se the system and ensure ste@@ ad@@ y impro@@ vement . 
At the same time , the number of Ma@@ tric stud@@ ents who pas@@ s Ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs at the higher gr@@ ade is only s@@ ligh@@ tly better than in 1995 . 
We also continue to s@@ how we@@ ak@@ nesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme . 
Whi@@ le the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion programme has resul@@ ted in more sett@@ le@@ ments in the rec@@ ent period , we still need to put in ex@@ tr@@ a ef@@ for@@ t in de@@ aling with remain@@ ing cases , many of which are much more comple@@ x . 
On the other hand , very li@@ tt@@ le progres@@ s has been made in terms of land re@@ distribu@@ tion . 
We will under@@ take a car@@ ef@@ ul review of the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ing fac@@ tors so that this programme is ur@@ gen@@ tly spe@@ e@@ ded up . 
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strateg@@ ies to re@@ duce and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the p@@ over@@ ty that continu@@ es to aff@@ lic@@ t many of our people . 
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African Women in Di@@ al@@ og@@ ue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as T@@ un@@ isi@@ a and Chi@@ le where gre@@ at progres@@ s has been made in de@@ aling with p@@ over@@ ty , does poin@@ t to some def@@ ec@@ ts in our systems in this regard . 
F@@ ro@@ m the experi@@ ence of this deleg@@ ation it is c@@ le@@ ar that we must among other th@@ ings : 
De@@ fine clear@@ ly the p@@ over@@ ty ma@@ tri@@ x of our country ; 
De@@ vel@@ op a pro@@ per database of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds living in p@@ over@@ ty ; 
Identi@@ fy and imple@@ ment specific inter@@ ven@@ tions relevant to these hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ; 
Mon@@ it@@ or progres@@ s in these hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds as the programmes take effect in gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ating them out of p@@ over@@ ty ; 
In this con@@ text , address all indigen@@ ce , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
Co@@ -@@ ordin@@ ate and a@@ lig@@ n all anti@@ -@@ p@@ over@@ ty programmes to maxim@@ ise impact and a@@ vo@@ id wa@@ st@@ age and du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation ; 
Acc@@ eler@@ ate the training of Family Social Wor@@ kers at professional and au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary levels to ensure that identified hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds are proper@@ ly sup@@ ported and monit@@ or@@ ed . 
This will ensure the syste@@ mati@@ c lin@@ k@@ age of benef@@ ici@@ aries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continu@@ ously foc@@ used on the t@@ ask to ensure that as many of our people as possible gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate out of depend@@ ence on social gr@@ ants and enter the labour market . 
In the me@@ an@@ time , we will continue to ex@@ pl@@ ore new initi@@ atives which will progres@@ si@@ vely improve the social w@@ age . 
A cri@@ tical leg of these social inter@@ ven@@ tions should be the inten@@ si@@ fication of jo@@ int ef@@ for@@ ts among all South Afric@@ ans to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on . 
In this year of the 60@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the Do@@ c@@ tors P@@ act of lea@@ ders of African and In@@ di@@ an communities , the 30@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the m@@ ur@@ der of Ste@@ ve B@@ ik@@ o and the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the visit to D@@ ak@@ ar by Afrik@@ an@@ er intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als to meet the AN@@ C , the issue of our variety of identi@@ ties and the over@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing s@@ ense of bel@@ on@@ ging to South Africa needs to be better can@@ v@@ ass@@ ed ac@@ ross soci@@ ety , in a manner that streng@@ th@@ ens our un@@ ity as a n@@ ation . 
F@@ ur@@ ther , on this the 30@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the ban@@ ning of The World and The We@@ ek@@ end World new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , we are du@@ ty@@ -@@ b@@ ound to ask the ques@@ tion - have we all fully inter@@ na@@ lis@@ ed our responsibility in building social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and promo@@ ting a common s@@ ense of bel@@ on@@ ging , re@@ in@@ for@@ cing the g@@ lu@@ e that hol@@ ds our n@@ ation together ! 
In other word@@ s , measures required to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on cannot be under@@ taken by government al@@ one . 
We must together as South Afric@@ ans spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom from want and from mor@@ al dec@@ ay , and work to at@@ tain the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with it . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person ; 
I am certain that we shall all ag@@ ree that working together to achi@@ eve the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with fre@@ edom applies equ@@ ally to the chall@@ en@@ ge of de@@ aling with crime . 
In the 1994 R@@ D@@ P Whi@@ te Pap@@ er we said : 
Promo@@ ting pe@@ ace and security will invol@@ ve all people . 
It will build on and exp@@ and the national dri@@ ve for pe@@ ace and com@@ b@@ at the en@@ de@@ mi@@ c viol@@ ence fac@@ ed by communities with special atten@@ tion to the various forms of viol@@ ence to which women are sub@@ jec@@ ted 
Pe@@ ace and political st@@ ability are also c@@ entral to the govern@@ ments ef@@ for@@ ts to create an en@@ ab@@ ling environment to encour@@ age inves@@ tment De@@ ci@@ sive action will be taken to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate law@@ l@@ ess@@ ness , dr@@ ug tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ king , g@@ un r@@ un@@ ning , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , we cannot er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive and claim the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with fre@@ edom if communities live in fe@@ ar , clo@@ se@@ ted be@@ hin@@ d w@@ al@@ ls and bar@@ bed wi@@ re , ever an@@ x@@ ious in their hou@@ ses , on the stre@@ ets and on our roads , unable fre@@ ely to en@@ jo@@ y our public sp@@ ac@@ es . 
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , we must continue and further inten@@ si@@ fy the str@@ ug@@ g@@ le against crime . 
Whi@@ le we have already sur@@ passed that tar@@ ge@@ ted fi@@ g@@ ure of 15@@ 2 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , and while we have impro@@ ved the training programme , we recogn@@ ise the f@@ act that the impact of this is not y@@ et high en@@ ough for ever@@ y@@ body to fe@@ el a better s@@ ense of safety and security . 
Whi@@ le we have re@@ duced the incid@@ ence of most contact cri@@ mes , the annual re@@ duction rate with regard to such categories as ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y , ass@@ a@@ ult and m@@ ur@@ der is still below the 7-@@ 10 that we had tar@@ ge@@ ted . 
And the abuse of women and children continu@@ es at an un@@ accep@@ table level . 
The increase in the incid@@ ence of particular cri@@ mes during the security workers str@@ i@@ ke should have b@@ rou@@ ght home to all of us the f@@ act that the security industry cannot be hand@@ led si@@ mp@@ ly as a private aff@@ air of the private sector . 
Q@@ ui@@ te clear@@ ly the regula@@ tory system that we have in place is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate . 
This applies to such issues as w@@ age levels , person@@ nel v@@ etting systems , en@@ for@@ cement of guidel@@ ines on cas@@ h@@ -@@ delivery vehicles , and so on . 
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addi@@ tion to impro@@ ving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the public , in which hu@@ ge resources are exp@@ en@@ ded , are ac@@ tu@@ ally met . 
We will also continue to put more ef@@ for@@ t into impro@@ ving the func@@ tion@@ ing of our courts , to increase the rate of re@@ duction in case bac@@ k@@ log@@ s . 
And we will ensure that deci@@ sions to exp@@ and the Correctional Services infrastructure , improve the management of B@@ order Cont@@ rol as well as the im@@ migr@@ ation and docu@@ mentation services , among oth@@ ers , are implemen@@ ted . 
M@@ any of the we@@ ak@@ nesses in impro@@ ving services to the pop@@ ulation deri@@ ve in part from in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
As such , in the period le@@ ading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our ag@@ end@@ a . 
What has emer@@ ged , among oth@@ ers , as a cri@@ tical area for strategi@@ c intervention is the content of training that public serv@@ ants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in ac@@ tual f@@ act should be the maj@@ or service provi@@ der including in the mass in@@ duction of public serv@@ ants . 
Comp@@ li@@ ance levels within departments , in rel@@ ation to public service and fin@@ ance management legislation , have been some@@ what mix@@ ed . 
Ob@@ vi@@ ously this cannot be allow@@ ed to continue , even if we take into account the correc@@ t ob@@ serv@@ ation that audi@@ ting requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent . 
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particul@@ arly for senior management is cr@@ u@@ cial . 
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue ap@@ ace . 
Im@@ medi@@ ately after the March 2006 local government elec@@ tions , in@@ duction programmes were conduc@@ ted , taking into account that 62 of the may@@ ors are new . 
What is of concer@@ n , th@@ ough , is that in many of these municipalities , many vac@@ an@@ cies remain or have emer@@ ged in senior management and the profes@@ sions . 
The programme to a@@ lig@@ n planning instru@@ ments ac@@ ross the spher@@ es of government is continu@@ ing , with pil@@ ot projects for complete a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment being r@@ un in 13 of our distr@@ ic@@ ts and metro@@ s . 
These pil@@ ot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
It is a matter of pro@@ u@@ d record that over hal@@ f of the distr@@ ic@@ ts and metro@@ s have held their Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mits , and the rest inten@@ d to complete this process by the end of February . 
This will la@@ y the basis for coo@@ per@@ ation among all social part@@ ners in spe@@ eding up local economic development . 
I would like to take advan@@ t@@ age of this occ@@ asi@@ on to ex@@ pres@@ s my gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de to Deputy President Ph@@ um@@ z@@ ile M@@ lam@@ bo@@ -@@ N@@ g@@ cu@@ ka for the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing lea@@ ders@@ hip she has given to the implementation of the Acc@@ eler@@ ated and S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth Ini@@ ti@@ ative , working with the Ministers and Premi@@ ers who constitu@@ te the T@@ ask Te@@ am , con@@ cre@@ te@@ ly addres@@ sing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of inves@@ tment and la@@ bour@@ -@@ ab@@ s@@ or@@ ption , as well as matters per@@ taining to skills development and the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the state system . 
We high@@ ly app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the contribu@@ tion of all M@@ emb@@ ers of the Executive and our public service man@@ ag@@ ers , ac@@ ross the three spher@@ es of government , in le@@ ading this process and in implementing the government programme as a who@@ le . 
This is c@@ entral to our ef@@ for@@ ts to er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in our soci@@ ety so that we can spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom and the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with li@@ ber@@ ty . 
In this regard , in order further to spe@@ ed up the implementation of As@@ gi@@ SA , over and above the multi@@ -@@ year programmes ann@@ oun@@ ced in the rec@@ ent p@@ ast , government will this year : 
complete the process of re@@ view@@ ing the countr@@ ys experi@@ ence in the arti@@ cul@@ ation among such m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic indic@@ ators as the Ex@@ change R@@ ate , inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industr@@ ies which produce tr@@ ad@@ ab@@ les for both the domestic and export mark@@ ets , and have the potential to ab@@ s@@ or@@ b lar@@ ge p@@ ools of sem@@ i@@ -@@ sk@@ il@@ led workers ; 
in line with the National Indus@@ trial Policy Fr@@ amework which has now been completed , we will : 
inten@@ si@@ fy implementation of custom@@ ised sector measures to facilitate inv@@ est@@ ments in Business Pro@@ c@@ ess Ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing , tourism , bio@@ -@@ fu@@ els and chemicals , and fin@@ ali@@ se practi@@ cal programmes for for@@ es@@ try and pap@@ er , clo@@ thing and tex@@ ti@@ les , met@@ als and eng@@ ine@@ ering ; 
develop an over@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing strategy to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ se key inter@@ ven@@ tions in min@@ ing and min@@ er@@ al benef@@ ici@@ ation , agric@@ ulture and ag@@ ro@@ -@@ process@@ ing , the wh@@ i@@ te goods sector , cre@@ ative industr@@ ies , community and social services and ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ e@@ u@@ tic@@ als . 
This must include a determined dri@@ ve to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
Wit@@ h regard to min@@ er@@ al benef@@ ici@@ ation for in@@ stance , we will set up a State Di@@ am@@ ond Tr@@ ader that will pur@@ ch@@ ase 10 of di@@ am@@ onds from local produc@@ ers and sel@@ l them to local cu@@ t@@ ters and produc@@ ers . 
We are happ@@ y that De@@ Be@@ ers has agre@@ ed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and ass@@ et provision for a period of three years ; 
Wit@@ h regard to communic@@ ations , I am ple@@ ased to ann@@ oun@@ ce that the Department of Communications together with the mo@@ bi@@ le telephone compan@@ ies and Tel@@ kom are fin@@ alis@@ ing plan@@ s to address call termin@@ ation rates this year for the benefit of all consum@@ ers . 
In addi@@ tion , Tel@@ kom will apply a special low rate for international b@@ and@@ wid@@ th to 10 development call centres each employ@@ ing 1@@ 000 persons , as part of the ef@@ for@@ t to exp@@ and the B@@ PO sector . 
These centres will be established in areas identified by government . 
The special rate will be directly com@@ par@@ able to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the com@@ par@@ able countries . 
We will also take a variety of ste@@ ps to improve competi@@ tion in the econ@@ omy , among oth@@ ers to low@@ er the cost of do@@ ing business and promote inves@@ tment , including practi@@ cal intro@@ duction of the Reg@@ ula@@ tory I@@ mp@@ act Ass@@ ess@@ ment system , developing high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed national and international bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and capacity , fin@@ alis@@ ing the plan to improve the capacity of the r@@ ail and port oper@@ ators , and streng@@ th@@ ening the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of our competi@@ tion author@@ ities . 
The progres@@ s we have made with regard to the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of F@@ ur@@ ther Education and Training Col@@ leg@@ es has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibi@@ lity for us sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly to exp@@ and the number of available arti@@ s@@ ans . 
St@@ ar@@ ting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to train@@ ees in need , who enter these institutions . 
At the same time , we shall ur@@ gen@@ tly resol@@ ve the issue of responsibi@@ lities between the national and provincial spher@@ es in the management of the FE@@ T system . 
We do h@@ ope that our ef@@ for@@ ts to promote this area of opportun@@ ity will help send the m@@ ess@@ age especially to our young people , that arti@@ s@@ an skills are as cri@@ tical for economic growth as other levels of quali@@ fication . 
Af@@ ter inten@@ se inter@@ action between government and lea@@ ders of our uni@@ versi@@ ties , agreement has been re@@ ached and deci@@ sions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in sh@@ ort supp@@ ly are provided . 
In this regard , we wish to com@@ men@@ d the role pla@@ y@@ ed by the Jo@@ int Ini@@ ti@@ ative on Skills Ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , which br@@ ings together government , business , labour , training institu@@ tes and oth@@ ers . 
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers know , we have also sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly increas@@ ed the number of non-@@ fee pay@@ ing schools . 
In car@@ ry@@ ing out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be inform@@ ed by our commit@@ ment to ensure that the 2010 FI@@ F@@ A World C@@ up is the best ever . 
We wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te our Local Organis@@ ing Committee and other part@@ ners for the ster@@ ling work they are do@@ ing . 
Q@@ ui@@ te clear@@ ly , in order to ensure that all South Afric@@ ans en@@ jo@@ y the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with a gro@@ wing econ@@ omy , these and other measures will need to be ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by an inten@@ si@@ fied programme to address chall@@ eng@@ es in the Sec@@ ond Economy . 
B@@ ec@@ ause of this , during the course of this year , we will among other th@@ ings : 
take further practi@@ cal action to improve access to micro@@ -@@ fin@@ ance including the re@@ ach of the A@@ pe@@ x Fund and the agricultural micro@@ -@@ cre@@ dit fund ; 
ensure the pro@@ per func@@ tion@@ ing of the Small Enter@@ pris@@ es Development Agency , SE@@ D@@ A ; 
process the Comp@@ an@@ ies Bill , adopted for public com@@ ment by Cabinet last W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , as part of the bat@@ ter@@ y of measures to re@@ duce the regula@@ tory bur@@ den on small , medi@@ um and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es and to em@@ power min@@ ority sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders and employees ; 
having sur@@ passed the 10 000 tar@@ get we set our@@ sel@@ ves , we will increase the number of young people eng@@ aged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plan@@ s in this regard , en@@ rol 30 000 young volun@@ te@@ ers in community development initi@@ atives , and em@@ plo@@ y 5 000 young people as part of the Ex@@ pan@@ ded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buil@@ dings ; 
inten@@ si@@ fy ef@@ for@@ ts to integr@@ ate youth development into the main@@ stre@@ am of government work , including a youth coo@@ per@@ atives programme , and the on@@ going ef@@ for@@ ts to lin@@ k un@@ employed gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates with employment opportunities â and in this regard we wish to th@@ ank the many compan@@ ies , public and private , bi@@ g and small , which have respon@@ ded in a sp@@ len@@ di@@ d and practi@@ cal manner to this initi@@ ative ; 
start implementing the Commun@@ al Land Rights Act in order to improve economic u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of commun@@ al land , while at the same time exp@@ and@@ ing assistance such as ir@@ rig@@ ation , se@@ eds and imple@@ ments to small and coo@@ per@@ ative f@@ arm@@ ers . 
H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers ; 
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted dri@@ ve in which all of South Africa should eng@@ age in order to re@@ duce the levels of p@@ over@@ ty and in@@ equ@@ ality in our soci@@ ety . 
For us it is not a m@@ ere cli@@ ch@@ Ã© to ass@@ er@@ t that the succ@@ ess of our demo@@ cracy should and will be meas@@ ured by the con@@ cre@@ te ste@@ ps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vul@@ ner@@ able in our soci@@ ety . 
A cri@@ tical part of this re@@ form will be the t@@ ask of re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing a def@@ ec@@ t identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of In@@ qui@@ ry into a Com@@ prehensive Sy@@ stem of Social Security in South Africa . 
This is that the contribu@@ tory ear@@ n@@ ings@@ -@@ related pil@@ lar of our social security system is mis@@ sing or un@@ re@@ li@@ able for lar@@ ge numbers of working people . 
The prin@@ cip@@ le g@@ ui@@ ding this appro@@ ach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government bud@@ get , we need to ex@@ pl@@ ore the intro@@ duction of an ear@@ n@@ ings@@ -@@ related contribu@@ tory social security system that is inform@@ ed by the prin@@ cip@@ le of social soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity . 
This will me@@ an that all South Afric@@ ans will en@@ jo@@ y memb@@ ership of a common , administr@@ ati@@ vely efficient social ins@@ ur@@ ance system , while those ear@@ ning higher in@@ comes will be able to continue contribu@@ ting to private re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment and ins@@ ur@@ ance schem@@ es . 
In the disc@@ us@@ sions th@@ us f@@ ar conduc@@ ted within government , cons@@ ens@@ us is emer@@ ging that ele@@ ments of this system would need to include : 
continu@@ ation of the minimum benefits contain@@ ed in our social gr@@ ants system with the benefits paid through a mo@@ der@@ n administrative system ; 
a w@@ age subsi@@ dy for low@@ -@@ w@@ age employees , pos@@ si@@ bly direc@@ ted at first entr@@ ants into the job market , especially young people ; 
a social security tax to fin@@ ance basic re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings , death , dis@@ ability and un@@ employment benefits . 
The Minister of Finance will further el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on these issues in the Bud@@ get Spe@@ ec@@ h . 
What we should under@@ line th@@ ough is that in fin@@ is@@ hing the new social security disp@@ ensation , government will under@@ take a com@@ prehensive process of consult@@ ation with all social part@@ ners both individu@@ ally and through N@@ ED@@ LA@@ C . 
In addi@@ tion , we have also star@@ ted exam@@ ining measures to re@@ ach vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 years . 
O@@ ur programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
Ge@@ en po@@ gings om die openbare or@@ de ter wil@@ le van self@@ su@@ g@@ tige ei@@ e@@ belang om@@ ver te wer@@ p , sal ged@@ ul@@ d word nie . 
ens@@ uring the implementation , without further del@@ ay , of measures to re@@ duce the cost of medic@@ ines ; 
continu@@ ing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural ca@@ uses of death in our soci@@ ety as well as li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le diseases , mal@@ ari@@ a , the various str@@ ain@@ s of TB , road accid@@ ents and viol@@ ent crime . 
In this regard , government comm@@ its it@@ self to inten@@ si@@ fy the c@@ ampaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all ele@@ ments of the com@@ prehensive appro@@ ach such as pre@@ vention , hom@@ e-@@ based care and treatment . 
We shall ensure that the part@@ nershi@@ ps buil@@ t over the years are streng@@ th@@ ened , and that our impro@@ ved national com@@ prehensive strategy against AIDS and s@@ exually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions is fin@@ alised as soon as possible . 
This year we shall complete con@@ cre@@ te plan@@ s on implementation of the fin@@ al st@@ ages of our programmes to meet the tar@@ gets for uni@@ ver@@ sal access to water in 2008 , sanit@@ ation in 2010 and elec@@ tricity in 2@@ 012 . 
All these ef@@ for@@ ts , M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person , must go hand in hand with a sustain@@ ed dri@@ ve to improve community safety and security . 
In this regard , government will ensure that the deci@@ sions already taken about streng@@ th@@ ening our fi@@ ght against crime are effecti@@ vely implemen@@ ted . 
The chall@@ en@@ ge that we fac@@ e in addres@@ sing this issue has li@@ tt@@ le to do with policies . 
R@@ a@@ ther , what is required is effective organisation , mo@@ bi@@ lis@@ ation and lea@@ ders@@ hip of the mass of law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement , intelligen@@ ce and correc@@ tions officers , and func@@ tion@@ aries of the justice system . 
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of these public serv@@ ants have pro@@ ven over and over ag@@ ain in ac@@ tual practice that they are prepar@@ ed to put their li@@ ves on the line and to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ e even the li@@ tt@@ le quality time they could have with their fam@@ i@@ lies , in defence of our fre@@ edom and our security . 
In addi@@ tion to the many on@@ going programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : 
bring the oper@@ ations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by fil@@ ling vac@@ ant po@@ sts , impro@@ ving systems and implementing other recommend@@ ations of the T@@ ask Te@@ am that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this v@@ ital institution ; 
imple@@ ment the recommend@@ ations of the K@@ h@@ am@@ pe@@ pe Commission on the mand@@ ate and oper@@ ations of the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations ; 
u@@ ti@@ li@@ se to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and gener@@ ally improve management of the courts and the pro@@ sec@@ ution service , in order m@@ assi@@ vely to re@@ duce case bac@@ k@@ log@@ s ; 
fin@@ ali@@ se remain@@ ing ele@@ ments of measures to trans@@ form the judi@@ ci@@ ary and improve its func@@ tion@@ ing , in consult@@ ation with this em@@ in@@ ent institution of our demo@@ cracy ; 
imple@@ ment the programmes deci@@ ded up@@ on to build more correc@@ tions facilities and re@@ ali@@ se the objec@@ tives of the Whi@@ te Pap@@ er on Cor@@ rec@@ tions ; 
continue with the processes further to capac@@ it@@ ate our intelligen@@ ce ag@@ en@@ cies , and ensure that at all times they oper@@ ate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ; 
improve our anal@@ ysi@@ s of crime tr@@ ends to improve our performance with regard both to crime pre@@ vention and crime com@@ b@@ ating . 
In this regard , we must respon@@ d to the col@@ d re@@ ality that , as in other countries , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of viol@@ ent cri@@ mes against the person occ@@ ur in the most soci@@ o-@@ econom@@ ically dep@@ riv@@ ed areas of our country and require str@@ ong and sustain@@ ed community inter@@ ven@@ tions foc@@ used on crime pre@@ vention . 
As we have already said , these and other measures will succ@@ eed only if we build an end@@ uring part@@ nership in ac@@ tual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more diffic@@ ult for the crimin@@ als . 
In this regard , we are he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed by the resol@@ ve sho@@ wn by lea@@ ders of the business and relig@@ ious communities further to streng@@ then such part@@ nershi@@ ps on the groun@@ d , and to give of their time and resources to streng@@ then the fi@@ ght against crime . 
Government will pla@@ y its part to ensure that these part@@ nershi@@ ps ac@@ tu@@ ally work , and that we all act together to dis@@ charge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
I should men@@ tion in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on pro@@ pos@@ als further to improve the func@@ tion@@ ing and effecti@@ ven@@ ess of the v@@ it@@ ally important Community Police For@@ ums . 
F@@ ur@@ ther to improve its service to the people , government should op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e its capacity and organis@@ ational eff@@ ici@@ ency . 
To achi@@ eve these objec@@ tives , we will during the course of this year : 
streng@@ then monitoring and evalu@@ ation capacity ac@@ ross all the spher@@ es , including training of man@@ ag@@ ers responsible for the implementation of this system ; 
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant nor@@ ms and standards , re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation policy and matters per@@ taining to medical aid and p@@ ensi@@ ons ; 
inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach and awareness on issues of national sp@@ ati@@ al development , while increas@@ ing the number of municipalities involved in the har@@ mon@@ is@@ ation of planning instru@@ ments ac@@ ross the three spher@@ es ; 
conduct capacity assess@@ ments and imple@@ ment inter@@ ven@@ tions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premi@@ ers , while continu@@ ing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
while inten@@ si@@ f@@ ying the public sector and national anti@@ cor@@ ruption c@@ ampaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of our anti@@ cor@@ ruption strateg@@ ies for all spher@@ es of government ; 
ro@@ ll out the Ba@@ th@@ o P@@ ele c@@ ampaign at local government level , inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach activities including iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and set up more multi@@ purpose Community Centres be@@ y@@ ond the 90 currently operational ; 
further capac@@ it@@ ate and provide more support to the institution of traditional lea@@ ders@@ hip . 
Impro@@ ving govern@@ ance also means having a s@@ ound statisti@@ cal database about social d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics within our n@@ ation . 
In this regard , two maj@@ or sur@@ ve@@ ys will be under@@ taken in 2007 . 
As of two days ag@@ o 6 000 field workers from St@@ atisti@@ cs South Africa have g@@ one out ac@@ ross our country to collec@@ t information on 2@@ 80 000 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ch@@ os@@ en to participate in a Community Sur@@ ve@@ y , which will give government as accur@@ ate as possible a s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of the circum@@ stan@@ ces of citizens in every part of the country . 
In October another 30 000 individu@@ als in 8 000 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds will be sel@@ ected to participate in South Afric@@ as first national pan@@ el stud@@ y , the National In@@ come D@@ yn@@ am@@ ics Stu@@ dy . 
These 30 000 individu@@ als will be trac@@ ked over time , to further our under@@ standing of such issues such as migr@@ ation , labour market tran@@ si@@ tions , inter@@ -gener@@ ational mo@@ bility and hou@@ se@@ hold formation and dis@@ so@@ lution . 
I wish to take this opportun@@ ity to call on all those sel@@ ected to coo@@ per@@ ate fully in these important under@@ tak@@ ings . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person : 
A@@ mon@@ g the gre@@ at@@ est achiev@@ e@@ ments of the pe@@ opl@@ es of Africa in the p@@ ast tw@@ o-@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f years has been the res@@ tor@@ ation of pe@@ ace in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es Reg@@ ion . 
We are pro@@ u@@ d , as South Afric@@ ans , of the role that our people have pla@@ y@@ ed in hel@@ ping to bring this about â from the young m@@ en and women in our National De@@ f@@ ence For@@ ce to employees of public and private institutions who ga@@ ve of their time to ensure that the African dre@@ am fin@@ ds practi@@ cal re@@ alisation in the hom@@ el@@ and of Pa@@ tric@@ e L@@ um@@ um@@ b@@ a . 
We will continue to work with the si@@ ster people of the D@@ R@@ C , as well as Bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , the Com@@ or@@ os and S@@ ud@@ an in particular to ensure that the condi@@ tion of pe@@ ace and st@@ ability th@@ us f@@ ar at@@ tained trans@@ la@@ tes without pa@@ use into concer@@ ted action for economic re@@ con@@ struction and social development . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , while we are fully j@@ usti@@ fied in c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating the achiev@@ e@@ ments that Africa has made in her en@@ de@@ av@@ our to achi@@ eve pe@@ ace and development , we cannot under@@ pla@@ y the chall@@ eng@@ es that we fac@@ e in de@@ aling with the remain@@ ing areas of conflic@@ t , particul@@ arly the general pe@@ ace process in S@@ ud@@ an , including the situ@@ ation in Dar@@ f@@ ur , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ i@@ re and S@@ om@@ ali@@ a . 
O@@ ur government will respon@@ d appropri@@ ately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Uni@@ on for assistance to the people and government of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a . 
Cri@@ tical in this regard , are the initi@@ atives under way to ensure that the pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ is@@ ts within S@@ om@@ ali@@ a inter@@ act with one another to find a so@@ lution that is inclu@@ sive and practi@@ c@@ able , based on the need to achi@@ eve national re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation . 
This year the African P@@ eer Re@@ view Forum will complete its review of our country . 
I wish to take this opportun@@ ity to th@@ ank our legisla@@ tors , government Ministers and departments , our civil soci@@ ety organisations and soci@@ ety at lar@@ ge for the contribu@@ tion they made to an exercise that was as chall@@ en@@ ging as it was uni@@ qu@@ e for our young demo@@ cracy . 
We will also take the necessary ste@@ ps to imple@@ ment the required programme of action that will emer@@ ge as a result of the pe@@ er review process . 
Sim@@ il@@ arly , we will continue to work with the rest of our contin@@ ent and our development part@@ ners to spe@@ ed up the implementation of the NE@@ PA@@ D programmes . 
J@@ ust over a month ag@@ o , South Africa star@@ ted its t@@ our of du@@ ty as a non-@@ permanent member of the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations Security Council . 
We her@@ e@@ by wish to ple@@ dge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most es@@ te@@ em@@ ed of multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al bo@@ dies , do ever@@ y@@ thing necessary further to contribu@@ te to international pe@@ ace and security . 
In this regard we will also continue to eng@@ age the lea@@ ders of the pe@@ opl@@ es of P@@ al@@ est@@ ine , Is@@ ra@@ el , I@@ ra@@ q , I@@ r@@ an and other countries in the Mid@@ d@@ le East and the Per@@ si@@ an G@@ ul@@ f . 
We shall also continue to streng@@ then our relations with other countries on the contin@@ ent , our part@@ ners in In@@ di@@ a , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and the Pe@@ opl@@ es Republic of Ch@@ ina , other countries of the South , as well as J@@ ap@@ an , E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe and North A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a . 
One of the cri@@ tical ques@@ tions that we shall pur@@ su@@ e in this regard is the spe@@ ed@@ y res@@ um@@ ption of the Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound of W@@ TO neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations . 
We are con@@ vin@@ ced that so@@ lu@@ tions to the log@@ j@@ ams currently being experi@@ enc@@ ed can be found , and that it is in the l@@ ong@@ -@@ term interest of developed and developing countries a@@ like that these t@@ al@@ ks should re@@ ach fr@@ ui@@ tion . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker , C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person and H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers ; 
S@@ in@@ ce the pop@@ ula@@ r mand@@ ate of 2004 , we have made wel@@ come progres@@ s in further chan@@ ging South Africa for the better . 
We should not and do not under@@ pla@@ y the many diffic@@ ul@@ ties we still conf@@ ron@@ t . 
B@@ ut the m@@ ess@@ age that our collec@@ tive experi@@ ence communic@@ ates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succ@@ eed in me@@ eting the common objec@@ tive we have set our@@ sel@@ ves as a n@@ ation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and repres@@ ent much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety . 
We should to@@ day , even more conf@@ id@@ ently , spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom . 
We should d@@ are to act in concer@@ t to pur@@ su@@ e the happ@@ in@@ ess that can come to m@@ en and women if they live in a land that is free . 
We are not there y@@ et . 
B@@ ut no one , except our@@ sel@@ ves , shall ensure that this dre@@ am is re@@ alised . 
And so , let us ro@@ ll up our s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and get down to work , fully under@@ standing that the t@@ ask to build the South Africa for which we year@@ n is a common responsibility we all share . 
Th@@ ank you . 
Issu@@ ed by : The Presid@@ ency February 2007  
State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ d@@ res@@ s of the President of South Africa , Th@@ ab@@ o Mbek@@ i : Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament February 2008 
Mr J@@ ac@@ o@@ b Z@@ uma , For@@ mer Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Con@@ gres@@ s ; 
C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person of SA@@ L@@ G@@ A , may@@ ors and lea@@ ders in our system of local government ; 
C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person of the National hou@@ se of traditional lea@@ ders and our hon@@ ou@@ red traditional lea@@ ders ; 
Al@@ low me on this occ@@ asi@@ on of the pen@@ ulti@@ mate Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the third Parliament for the annual deb@@ ate on the state of our n@@ ation , to wish all the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers of Parliament a happ@@ y and productive New Y@@ e@@ ar . 
I am conf@@ ident that 2008 will be one of the most re@@ mark@@ able years of our demo@@ cracy , as we all work together to re@@ ali@@ se the c@@ ore asp@@ ir@@ ation of our people to at@@ tain a better life for all . 
I sa@@ y this because , in our own esti@@ m@@ ation , it is not often that a n@@ ation is called up@@ on to str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to at@@ tain a dre@@ am . 
And such is the in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion that histor@@ y has im@@ posed on us to@@ day . 
I spe@@ ak here to@@ day in the pres@@ ence of my mother , E@@ pa@@ in@@ ette Mbek@@ i , Ma@@ Mo@@ fo@@ ken@@ g , who c@@ ame to communic@@ ate an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal m@@ ess@@ age from the rural m@@ ass@@ es of the Tran@@ sk@@ ei , among whom she has li@@ ved for many dec@@ ades . 
S@@ he says these m@@ ass@@ es de@@ m@@ and of all of us who claim to be their lea@@ ders , that we tel@@ l them and oth@@ ers like them el@@ se@@ where in our country , whether we remain commit@@ ted to the under@@ taking we have made that t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w will be better than to@@ day . 
In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 9@@ 2 years old . 
What she exp@@ ec@@ ts as her bir@@ th@@ day present is the tr@@ u@@ th . 
I th@@ ank her for taking the tro@@ ub@@ le to be with us to@@ day , and trust that we will not dis@@ appoint her . 
I would also like to take this opportun@@ ity to s@@ alu@@ te President N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ ela , one of the pre@@ -@@ em@@ in@@ ent f@@ oun@@ ding f@@ ath@@ ers of our demo@@ cracy , who will mark his 90@@ th bir@@ th@@ day on 18 July this year . 
We wel@@ come to this occ@@ asi@@ on Mr Ar@@ th@@ ur Mar@@ ge@@ man , repres@@ enting the v@@ eter@@ ans of the A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra b@@ us bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t of fi@@ f@@ ty years ag@@ o , who include N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ ela . 
We are also pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to have among us Ms Jan@@ n T@@ ur@@ ner , the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter of R@@ ic@@ k T@@ ur@@ ner who was m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed by ap@@ ar@@ theid agents 30 years ag@@ o . 
We are also ple@@ ased that we have among us Mr D@@ in@@ il@@ esi@@ z@@ we So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , s@@ on of the out@@ standing pa@@ tri@@ ot and le@@ ader , Ro@@ ber@@ t So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , who also passed a@@ way 30 years back after end@@ uring many years of im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment , b@@ anis@@ h@@ ment and other forms of repres@@ sion . 
We ac@@ knowledge , both among the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers and our gu@@ ests , the many f@@ oun@@ ders of the Uni@@ ted Demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c F@@ ron@@ t , 25 years ag@@ o . 
All these hon@@ ou@@ red gu@@ ests , repres@@ enting both m@@ em@@ ory and h@@ ope , re@@ min@@ d us by their pres@@ ence that ours is a t@@ ask in a rela@@ y r@@ ace of continu@@ ous re@@ birth so that the dre@@ am of a better life becomes a re@@ ality for all South Afric@@ ans . 
In@@ de@@ ed , they repres@@ ent a c@@ ele@@ bration of the ind@@ om@@ it@@ able sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of our people , and pose a chall@@ en@@ ge to all of us to act in ways that do not be@@ tra@@ y or dis@@ appoint the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the people . 
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c parliament and government soon after which we will hold our f@@ our@@ th general elec@@ tions . 
The Government has therefore re@@ view@@ ed the di@@ stance we have travel@@ led in terms of implementing the mand@@ ate given by the people in 2004 . 
I am ple@@ ased to sa@@ y that we have in@@ de@@ ed done much to imple@@ ment the commit@@ ments we made to the people in 2004 . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , and not un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ly , it is ob@@ vi@@ ous that we still have out@@ standing work to do in this regard . 
H@@ app@@ ily , this State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ d@@ res@@ s has given me the pos@@ sibi@@ lity to report to Parliament and the N@@ ation on our 24 A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities which , the H@@ on M@@ emb@@ ers can find on the Government website during the course of next week . 
The identi@@ fication of the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities means that all three spher@@ es of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are her@@ e@@ by making the fir@@ m under@@ taking that we will use the sh@@ ort period a@@ head of us further to en@@ erg@@ ise our adv@@ ance towards the re@@ alisation of the all@@ -@@ important go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
The enti@@ re@@ ty of our system of govern@@ ance is therefore making the commit@@ ment that in the period a@@ head of us , it will do its best to live up to the im@@ per@@ ative â Business Un@@ us@@ ual !
We spe@@ ak of Business Un@@ us@@ ual not refer@@ ring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the spe@@ ed@@ y , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the li@@ ves of our people should change for the better , so@@ on@@ er ra@@ ther than later . 
To make certain that this happ@@ ens , we have taken the necessary ste@@ ps to ensure that the Annual Bud@@ get the Minister of Finance will present later this month mak@@ es the necessary allocations to give us the means to imple@@ ment the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities . 
The main categories of these pri@@ or@@ ities are : 
the further acceler@@ ation of our economic growth and development 
spe@@ eding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achi@@ eve our economic and social go@@ als 
impro@@ ving the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of our inter@@ ven@@ tions direc@@ ted at the Sec@@ ond Economy , and p@@ over@@ ty er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation 
en@@ han@@ cing the impact of our programmes tar@@ ge@@ ting the cri@@ tic@@ ally important area of education and training 
acceler@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ e@@ ment of the go@@ al of health for all 
re@@ v@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system to inten@@ si@@ fy our off@@ ensive against crime 
further streng@@ th@@ ening the mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respon@@ d to our development im@@ per@@ atives and , 
en@@ han@@ cing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and Sou@@ th@@ -@@ South relations . 
M@@ ore than at any other time , the situ@@ ation that conf@@ ron@@ ts our n@@ ation and country , and the ta@@ sk@@ s we have set our@@ sel@@ ves , de@@ m@@ and that we in@@ sp@@ i@@ re and organis@@ e all our people to act together as one , to do all the th@@ ings that have to be done , under@@ standing that in a very re@@ al s@@ ense , all of us , together , hold our own fu@@ ture in our hand@@ s ! 
As we act together ever@@ y@@ where in our country , this we must also under@@ stand that what we have to be about is â Business Un@@ us@@ ual ! 
As I was prepar@@ ing this Ad@@ d@@ res@@ s , one among us su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted to me that our country was being bu@@ ff@@ e@@ ted by str@@ ong c@@ ro@@ ss@@ win@@ ds that made it especially diffic@@ ult to for@@ es@@ ee where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . 
H@@ e su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted that this mor@@ ning , to cap@@ ture what he consi@@ ders the ess@@ ence of the re@@ ality conf@@ ron@@ ting us , I should rec@@ all the well@@ -@@ kno@@ wn word@@ s with which Char@@ les D@@ ick@@ ens op@@ ened his no@@ vel , A T@@ ale of T@@ w@@ o C@@ ities . 
And so I qu@@ o@@ te these word@@ s : 
It was the best of times , it was the wor@@ st of times , it was the age of wis@@ d@@ om , it was the age of f@@ oo@@ lis@@ h@@ ness , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of be@@ li@@ ef , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of inc@@ re@@ du@@ lity , it was the se@@ as@@ on of Li@@ ght , it was the se@@ as@@ on of Dar@@ k@@ ness , it was the sp@@ ring of h@@ ope , it was the win@@ ter of des@@ pai@@ r , we had ever@@ y@@ thing before us , we had no@@ thing before us , we were all going direct to He@@ av@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - in sh@@ ort , the period was so f@@ ar like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est author@@ ities in@@ si@@ sted on its being received , for good or for e@@ vi@@ l , in the su@@ per@@ l@@ ative deg@@ ree of com@@ par@@ ison only . 
You will ask whether I ag@@ ree with this assessment , whether I to@@ o be@@ li@@ eve that we have enter@@ ed an er@@ a of conf@@ u@@ sion , in which all of us cannot but lo@@ se our way , un@@ sure of our ste@@ ps , un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y on our fe@@ et , f@@ ear@@ ful of the fu@@ ture ! 
M@@ y an@@ sw@@ er to this ques@@ tion is a defin@@ i@@ te No !
Li@@ ke the rest of our Government I am con@@ vin@@ ced that the fun@@ da@@ ment@@ als that have inform@@ ed our countr@@ ys for@@ ward mar@@ ch in the last 14 years remain in place . 
They continue to provide us with the str@@ ong b@@ ase from which we must proc@@ eed as we ke@@ ep our e@@ y@@ es fir@@ m@@ ly foc@@ used on the continu@@ ed p@@ urs@@ uit of the go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
Th@@ us should we all re@@ affir@@ m that we remain on course as we continue to str@@ i@@ ve to make ours a win@@ ning n@@ ation . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , like all the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers , I am aw@@ are of the f@@ act that many in our soci@@ ety are tro@@ ub@@ led by a de@@ ep s@@ ense of un@@ e@@ ase about where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . 
They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been th@@ ro@@ wn by the un@@ exp@@ ected dis@@ rup@@ tions in the supp@@ ly of elec@@ tricity . 
They are concerned about some develop@@ ments in our econ@@ omy , especially the ste@@ ad@@ y increase in interest rates , food and fu@@ el p@@ ric@@ es which further imp@@ over@@ is@@ h especially the poor . 
Some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own econ@@ omy of the th@@ re@@ at of economic rec@@ es@@ sion in the Uni@@ ted St@@ ates . 
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether we have the capacity to def@@ end the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c rights and the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c Constitution which were bor@@ n of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . 
This is d@@ riv@@ en by such develop@@ ments as the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the National C@@ ommissioner of Police , the su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of the National Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions , f@@ ear@@ s about a th@@ re@@ at to the in@@ depend@@ ence of the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the r@@ ule of law , and the atten@@ d@@ ant al@@ leg@@ ations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether our country is th@@ reat@@ ened by the an@@ ar@@ ch@@ y repres@@ ented by the criminal tor@@ ch@@ ing of six p@@ assen@@ ger train@@ s in T@@ sh@@ wan@@ e last month . 
Whi@@ le they recogn@@ ise and respect the right of the r@@ ul@@ ing party to regula@@ te its own af@@ fairs , they are concerned that it must continue to pla@@ y its role as one of the princi@@ pal ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ts of a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , non@@ ra@@ cial , non@@ s@@ exis@@ t and pro@@ sper@@ ous South Africa . 
Mo@@ st ob@@ vi@@ ously it would be ir@@ responsible to i@@ gn@@ ore these and other concer@@ ns or dis@@ mis@@ s them as m@@ ere j@@ er@@ em@@ i@@ ads ty@@ p@@ ical of the pro@@ ph@@ ets of d@@ oo@@ m . 
L@@ et me therefore make b@@ old to sa@@ y that this histor@@ ical mo@@ ment de@@ mand@@ s that our n@@ ation should uni@@ te as ne@@ ver before and str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to address our common chall@@ eng@@ es and ke@@ ep ali@@ ve the dre@@ am that has sustain@@ ed all of us as we travel@@ led al@@ ong the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the cre@@ ation of the South Africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our Constitution . 
The national emergency repres@@ ented by the current power out@@ ages pos@@ es the chall@@ en@@ ge and pres@@ ents the opportun@@ ity to the enti@@ re@@ ty of our n@@ ation to give con@@ cre@@ te ex@@ pres@@ sion to the call we have j@@ ust made for all of us to uni@@ te in action and act in un@@ ity to ke@@ ep our country on course . 
This must sa@@ y to all of us that we are in@@ de@@ ed in a period of chall@@ eng@@ es , but sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table chall@@ eng@@ es . 
And prec@@ is@@ ely because it is a period of chall@@ eng@@ es , it is also an er@@ a of opportun@@ ity ! 
In this regard , I would like to ex@@ pres@@ s our app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation and full agreement with the com@@ ments made by the Chief Executive of An@@ g@@ l@@ o A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Car@@ ro@@ ll , when she addres@@ sed the Min@@ ing In@@ d@@ aba here in Cape Town ear@@ lier this week , on T@@ u@@ es@@ day , February 5 . 
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers know , she said : I don@@ t regard the problems of en@@ ergy supp@@ ly here as a dis@@ aster . 
And South Africa is not al@@ one : there are pres@@ su@@ res on supp@@ ly regarding our exp@@ an@@ sion projects in Chi@@ le and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il . 
S@@ ure , the problems here are serious ; 
over@@ com@@ ing them will require ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity , especially in en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency and en@@ ergy sav@@ ing , as well as the development of altern@@ ative power supp@@ lies . 
B@@ ut if all of us can for@@ ge str@@ ong part@@ nershi@@ ps to t@@ ack@@ le the situ@@ ation , we will all come through â I h@@ ope rel@@ ati@@ vely un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed This is not a time for f@@ ing@@ er poin@@ ting , but for working together in fin@@ ding so@@ lu@@ tions . 
This having been said , it is ho@@ we@@ ver also necessary that we take this opportun@@ ity to con@@ ve@@ y to the country the ap@@ o@@ log@@ ies of both the Government and E@@ sk@@ om for the national emergency which has resul@@ ted in all of us having to cont@@ end with the con@@ sequ@@ ences of load sh@@ ed@@ ding . 
I would also like to th@@ ank all citizens for their res@@ ili@@ ence and for@@ be@@ aring in the fac@@ e of the current diffic@@ ul@@ ties . 
In the p@@ ast two weeks , the Ministers of Min@@ er@@ als and En@@ ergy and Public Enter@@ pris@@ es have out@@ lin@@ ed the nature of the emergency we conf@@ ron@@ t and what each one of us can do to nor@@ ma@@ li@@ se the situ@@ ation . 
L@@ ast week the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers had an opportun@@ ity to reflec@@ t on these matters . 
In ess@@ ence the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant r@@ ise in elec@@ tricity de@@ m@@ and over the last two years has ou@@ ts@@ tri@@ p@@ p@@ ed the new capacity we have b@@ rou@@ ght on stre@@ am . 
The res@@ ult@@ ant ti@@ ght supp@@ ly situ@@ ation mak@@ es the over@@ all system vul@@ ner@@ able to any incid@@ ent affec@@ ting the availa@@ bility of en@@ ergy . 
In this situ@@ ation , we have to cur@@ t@@ ail the un@@ plan@@ ned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immedi@@ ately is re@@ duce de@@ m@@ and and th@@ us ensure a better res@@ erve mar@@ g@@ in . 
As government our t@@ ask is to now le@@ ad and uni@@ te the country be@@ hin@@ d a c@@ ampaign for en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency that will address this chall@@ en@@ ge . 
A@@ mon@@ g other th@@ ings , we must use the current ad@@ versity to ensure that our hom@@ es and econ@@ omy become more en@@ ergy efficient . 
There are con@@ cre@@ te ac@@ tions each individual , hou@@ se@@ hold and business can take . 
These are being dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ated by the Department of Min@@ er@@ als and En@@ ergy and we remain open to any other su@@ g@@ ges@@ tions that you , our com@@ pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts , may give to us and share with one another . 
Die Regering sal begin met die implementering van â@@ @@ n veldtog om doeltreffende be@@ ligting te verseker , asook water@@ v@@ eh@@ it@@ ting deur middel van son@@ krag , die beheer van die la@@ s van war@@ m@@ water@@ toes@@ tel@@ le in huis@@ houd@@ ings , insluit@@ end behuis@@ ing@@ standaarde vir alle nuwe huis@@ e en ontwikkel@@ ings . 
An in@@ struction has been issued for all government buil@@ dings to re@@ duce their consum@@ ption of elec@@ tricity and please fe@@ el free to name and sh@@ ame those who do not . 
On the supp@@ ly side E@@ sk@@ om is working f@@ uri@@ ously to ensure the intro@@ duction of co-@@ gener@@ ation projects as a matter of ur@@ gency . 
We are taking ste@@ ps to en@@ h@@ ance E@@ sk@@ oms maintenance capacity . 
We have emergency t@@ ask te@@ ams de@@ aling with the chall@@ en@@ ge of co@@ al quality and supp@@ ly with the co@@ al min@@ ing industry and we are working to f@@ ast trac@@ k the appro@@ val and con@@ struction of g@@ as tur@@ bin@@ e projects . 
All these ac@@ tions , taken together with the elec@@ tricity sav@@ ing measures , will improve cer@@ tain@@ ty and ra@@ ise the res@@ erve mar@@ g@@ in . 
The m@@ assi@@ ve E@@ sk@@ om build programme in new gener@@ ation , trans@@ mission and distribu@@ tion capacity will continue ; 
and where possible , some projects will be acceler@@ ated . 
In this regard , I would like to th@@ ank the private sector for being prepar@@ ed to assist in wh@@ ate@@ ver way they can . 
In a me@@ eting with the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ man of General Elec@@ tric during the course of last week , G@@ E offered to assist by proc@@ uring s@@ car@@ ce tur@@ bin@@ e equipment on our behalf . 
In South Africa our own lar@@ ge compan@@ ies such as S@@ as@@ o@@ l , An@@ g@@ l@@ o and B@@ H@@ P B@@ illi@@ ton are all in con@@ cre@@ te disc@@ us@@ sions with the Departments of Min@@ er@@ al and En@@ ergy and Public Enter@@ pris@@ es to find cost effective and sustainable so@@ lu@@ tions to the supp@@ ly con@@ str@@ ain@@ t . 
The appro@@ ach is one of common action ra@@ ther than rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation . 
I particul@@ arly want to pay tribu@@ te to the min@@ ing industry for the way in which they have assi@@ sted us and the econ@@ omy to resol@@ ve a re@@ al cri@@ sis that hi@@ t us on the 24@@ th of January . 
We will all work to minim@@ ise the adver@@ se impact these events had on the industry . 
Col@@ lec@@ tive ef@@ for@@ t and consult@@ ation are at the centre of our respon@@ se to the emergency . 
T@@ ask te@@ ams are currently working in many areas . 
N@@ ex@@ t week the Provincial Premi@@ ers will con@@ ven@@ e their for@@ a with may@@ ors to plan and imple@@ ment the en@@ ergy sav@@ ing measures in all the municipalities ac@@ ross the country . 
They will be sup@@ ported by technical te@@ ams from ED@@ I H@@ ol@@ dings , E@@ sk@@ om and the National En@@ ergy E@@ ff@@ ici@@ ency Agency . 
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordin@@ ate this activ@@ ity sup@@ ported by the line Departments of Min@@ er@@ al and En@@ ergy and Public Enter@@ pris@@ es . 
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Bud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h on the support that the government will provide for the en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency c@@ ampaign and to E@@ sk@@ om in its build programme . 
We fac@@ e an emergency but we can over@@ come the problems in a rel@@ ati@@ vely sh@@ ort period . 
This situ@@ ation has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able re@@ alisation that the er@@ a of very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p and ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant elec@@ tricity has come to an end . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , given our lar@@ ge b@@ ase of inst@@ al@@ led gener@@ ation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain am@@ ong@@ st the few econom@@ ies with af@@ for@@ d@@ able elec@@ tricity . 
We are a min@@ er@@ als resource econ@@ omy . 
We must therefore continue to support the min@@ ing industry . 
It is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that if we are to continue on our growth p@@ ath as a manufac@@ t@@ uring country , we will also have to continue supporting the process@@ ing industry . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver it is im@@ per@@ ative that all enterpris@@ es become more en@@ ergy efficient . 
In@@ de@@ ed , en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency it@@ self provides economic opportun@@ ity . 
L@@ et us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building b@@ loc@@ ks of the ess@@ enti@@ al en@@ ergy efficient fu@@ ture we d@@ are not a@@ vo@@ id . 
L@@ et us ensure that all hand@@ s are on de@@ ck to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has hi@@ t us , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the appro@@ ach that our circum@@ stan@@ ces call for Business Un@@ us@@ ual ! 
This is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same appro@@ ach we must adop@@ t as we continue to prepar@@ e to ho@@ st the FI@@ F@@ A Con@@ fe@@ der@@ ations C@@ up in 2009 and the 2010 FI@@ F@@ A So@@ cc@@ er World C@@ up which will k@@ ic@@ k off in our country 85@@ 4 days from to@@ day . 
I men@@ tion this important matter here because the current chall@@ eng@@ es we are fac@@ ing have led some el@@ se@@ where in the world once more to ques@@ tion whether we will be able to ho@@ st these t@@ our@@ na@@ ments success@@ fully . 
Of course , I have ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te@@ ly no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we will hon@@ our our under@@ taking to FI@@ F@@ A and the world community of so@@ cc@@ er pla@@ y@@ ers and l@@ over@@ s to create all the necessary conditions for the hol@@ ding of the best ever FI@@ F@@ A So@@ cc@@ er World C@@ up t@@ our@@ na@@ ment . 
The s@@ ense that we get , ac@@ ross all sec@@ tors of South African soci@@ ety and further af@@ i@@ eld , repres@@ ented by the ac@@ tual da@@ ily progres@@ s we are making in terms of our all@@ -@@ ro@@ un@@ d prepar@@ ations , is one of - Business Un@@ us@@ ual : all hand@@ s on de@@ ck for 2010 !
We must ensure that we su@@ st@@ ain this appro@@ ach . 
We are fully aw@@ are that a cri@@ tical ele@@ ment of our prepar@@ ations should be the building of a str@@ ong South African te@@ am which will do us and the who@@ le of the f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all f@@ ra@@ ternity pro@@ u@@ d . 
I am certain that the South African F@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all Associ@@ ation , our co@@ ach@@ es led by Car@@ lo@@ s Alber@@ to Par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , and the pla@@ y@@ ers are aw@@ are of the he@@ av@@ y responsibility they car@@ ry to prepar@@ e a national te@@ am of which both we and Africa should be pro@@ u@@ d . 
Once more we th@@ ank the S@@ pr@@ ing@@ bo@@ ks for sho@@ wing the way when they w@@ on the R@@ ug@@ by World C@@ up last year . 
This must in@@ sp@@ i@@ re B@@ af@@ ana B@@ af@@ ana , as it must in@@ sp@@ i@@ re our ath@@ le@@ tes who will com@@ pe@@ te in the B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic G@@ am@@ es later this year . 
L@@ et me now tur@@ n to the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities I mentioned . 
F@@ ur@@ ther to acceler@@ ate our economic growth and development we will imple@@ ment the Indus@@ trial Policy Ac@@ tion Plan . 
Government will continue our indus@@ tri@@ alisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
In this regard , R@@ 2,@@ 3 b@@ illi@@ on has been bud@@ ge@@ ted for indus@@ trial policy initi@@ atives and a further R@@ 5 b@@ illi@@ on in tax inc@@ enti@@ ves over three years will support indus@@ trial policy . 
Wor@@ king together with business and labour , we shall also develop as ur@@ gen@@ tly as possible , key action plan@@ s in sec@@ tors where such plan@@ s do not exis@@ t , such as min@@ ing and min@@ er@@ als benef@@ ici@@ ation , consum@@ er d@@ ur@@ ab@@ les , ret@@ ail with a focus on impro@@ ving support to small enterpris@@ es , con@@ struction , the cre@@ ative industr@@ ies , agric@@ ulture and ag@@ ro@@ -@@ process@@ ing . 
Once more I would like to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se that we remain determined to support the aut@@ om@@ o@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is main@@ tained . 
At the m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic level , we will continue to maintain a fis@@ cal post@@ ure that sup@@ ports continu@@ ed economic growth and development and re@@ duc@@ ing our ex@@ ternal vul@@ ner@@ ability . 
To spe@@ ed up the process of building infrastructure we will fin@@ ali@@ se the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific em@@ ph@@ asis on en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency . 
This en@@ ta@@ il@@ s coordin@@ ating the programmes of the State@@ -@@ own@@ ed Enter@@ pris@@ es and over@@ la@@ ying all the infrastructure plan@@ s , including fre@@ igh@@ t and other log@@ istics , en@@ ergy pi@@ p@@ el@@ ines , information and communic@@ ations technology , road infrastructure , water and elec@@ tricity , both in terms of their ti@@ ming and geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c loc@@ ation . 
C@@ ut@@ ting ac@@ ross these plan@@ s , and therefore a cri@@ tical pri@@ ority , is information and communic@@ ations technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right . 
Acc@@ ord@@ ing@@ ly , we will this year complete the lic@@ ens@@ ing and oper@@ ation@@ alisation of Inf@@ rac@@ o . 
Al@@ ready , money has been allocated for S@@ ente@@ ch to become a wi@@ re@@ less inter@@ net w@@ hol@@ es@@ al@@ er as well as fin@@ ance its di@@ gi@@ ti@@ s@@ ation . 
Wor@@ king with other govern@@ ments on the contin@@ ent and the private sector , we will complete the process to laun@@ ch the under@@ se@@ a c@@ ab@@ les . 
At the same time , we aim to provide dig@@ ital bro@@ ad@@ casting to 50 of the pop@@ ulation by the end of the year . 
A@@ tt@@ ached to this will be a manufac@@ t@@ uring strategy for the development in South Africa of S@@ et T@@ op Bo@@ x@@ es , which should be fin@@ alised by the mid@@ d@@ le of the year . 
H@@ av@@ ing no@@ ted that the tar@@ din@@ ess with which government processes applications for inves@@ tment in rel@@ ation to issues such as land ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , infrastructure and environmental impact assess@@ ments can at times make or bre@@ ak inves@@ tor deci@@ sions , we have deci@@ ded , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Business Un@@ us@@ ual , work is progres@@ sing ur@@ gen@@ tly to set up a call centre through which pro@@ spec@@ tive inves@@ tors and government can trac@@ k these processes . 
An ele@@ ment of govern@@ ments A@@ pe@@ x of Pri@@ or@@ ities will be deli@@ ber@@ ate focus on matters of skills development . 
Wor@@ k to review the National Human Resource Development Strateg@@ y will be completed this year , and the projects that the jo@@ int te@@ am of government , labour , business and ac@@ ademi@@ c institutions organis@@ ed under the Jo@@ int Ini@@ ti@@ ative on Pri@@ ority Skills Ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion will be inten@@ si@@ fied . 
In@@ de@@ ed , we are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged by the good respon@@ se from the private sector as de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated through the commit@@ ment by the C@@ E@@ O@@ s of 70 of the J@@ SE@@ -@@ listed compan@@ ies to work with government in addres@@ sing the chall@@ en@@ ge of s@@ car@@ ce skills . 
In addi@@ tion to this work we will in the com@@ ing period pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ se further inter@@ ven@@ tions in the further education and training col@@ leg@@ es , the sector education and training author@@ ities , resour@@ cing schools in the low@@ est three qu@@ in@@ ti@@ les , f@@ ree@@ ing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and spe@@ eding up on-@@ the@@ -@@ job training for professional gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates . 
F@@ ur@@ ther , after correc@@ ting we@@ ak@@ nesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month laun@@ ch the K@@ ha R@@ i G@@ u@@ de mass liter@@ acy c@@ ampaign . 
This will include the training of m@@ aster train@@ ers who will provide basic liter@@ acy cla@@ s@@ ses to 300 000 ad@@ ults and youth in 2008 . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person 
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should al@@ ways be , the consider@@ ation whether their succ@@ ess is hel@@ ping to improve the quality of life of all South Afric@@ ans , acting as an important weap@@ on in our W@@ ar on P@@ over@@ ty and acceler@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the at@@ tain@@ ment of such objec@@ tives as the re@@ duction of un@@ employment and advan@@ cing the go@@ al of health for all . 
In the programme to provide sustainable human sett@@ le@@ ments , we are now able to provide 2@@ 60 000 housing un@@ its per ann@@ um , and an agreement has been re@@ ached with the South African Local Government Associ@@ ation to place a mor@@ at@@ ori@@ um on the s@@ ale of land that can be av@@ ailed for the housing programme . 
Al@@ ong with the progres@@ s we are making in the variety of inter@@ ven@@ tions foc@@ used on p@@ over@@ ty re@@ duction , we continue to address a number many we@@ ak@@ nesses , including the process@@ ing of the Land U@@ se Management Bill , the fin@@ alisation of the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion cases , the support programme for those who ac@@ qui@@ re land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . 
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special atten@@ tion during this year , and ensure that we meet the tar@@ gets we have set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
Y@@ et another cri@@ tical A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ ority is the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of an integrated and com@@ prehensive anti@@ -@@ p@@ over@@ ty strategy that addres@@ ses especially sections of the pop@@ ulation most affected by this s@@ cour@@ ge . 
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and ur@@ ban inform@@ al sett@@ le@@ ments , people with dis@@ abili@@ ties or ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nesses and the el@@ der@@ ly . 
A@@ mon@@ g the key pro@@ posed inter@@ ven@@ tions are : exp@@ and@@ ing the public works programme , employment subsi@@ dies for direct j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation for tar@@ ge@@ ted group@@ s , en@@ han@@ cing employment search cap@@ ability , impro@@ ving education and training , impro@@ ving services and ass@@ ets among poor communities , specific inter@@ ven@@ tions in poor hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , and ens@@ uring effecti@@ ven@@ ess of institutions supporting women and other sec@@ tors . 
A@@ mon@@ g oth@@ ers , we will make an evalu@@ ation of the gen@@ der mach@@ in@@ er@@ y so as to improve all a@@ spec@@ ts related to women em@@ powerment . 
Par@@ alle@@ l to this initi@@ ative is a special project to exam@@ ine inter@@ ven@@ tions required to deal with vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 . 
B@@ ut we will all ag@@ ree that our soci@@ ety , and the poor speci@@ fic@@ ally , cannot w@@ ai@@ t for strateg@@ ies and di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ es and work@@ shop@@ s â important as these may be . 
In any case , most of the inter@@ ven@@ tions possible are th@@ ings that government is already do@@ ing th@@ ough not suff@@ ici@@ ently integrated . 
As such , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Business Un@@ us@@ ual , government inten@@ ds this year to inten@@ si@@ fy the c@@ ampaign to identi@@ fy specific hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds and individu@@ als in di@@ re need and to put in place inter@@ ven@@ tions that will help , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing period , to alle@@ vi@@ ate their p@@ light in those individual hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds . 
For this , we will require a National W@@ ar Roo@@ m for a W@@ ar Ag@@ ain@@ st P@@ over@@ ty br@@ ing@@ ing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administr@@ ations , which will work with non@@ govern@@ mental organisations and business to identi@@ fy the inter@@ ven@@ tions required in specific hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds and imple@@ ment them as a matter of ur@@ gency . 
Die ou@@ dit van grond@@ eien@@ aar@@ skap sal ook bes@@ po@@ e@@ dig word . 
inten@@ si@@ f@@ ying ef@@ for@@ ts already star@@ ted to sc@@ ale up assistance to coo@@ per@@ atives and small enterpris@@ es especially those invol@@ ving women , with em@@ ph@@ asis on providing training and mark@@ ets , including lin@@ king them up with established out@@ l@@ ets ; 
sc@@ aling up the National Youth Service programme including a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ated increase of the in@@ take in the M@@ ili@@ tary Skills Development programme of the South African National De@@ f@@ ence For@@ ce from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . 
R@@ 7@@ 00 million has already been given to the S@@ AND@@ F to start sc@@ aling up this programme ; 
Die uit@@ breiding van die openbare werk@@ e-@@ program , wat , deur die vas@@ gestelde doelwitte te oortre@@ f , die poten@@ siaal ge@@ toon het om meer nu@@ wel@@ inge te ab@@ s@@ or@@ ber . 
Ab@@ out R1 b@@ illi@@ on over the b@@ as@@ el@@ ine will be allocated to programmes that f@@ all within the E@@ P@@ W@@ P ; 
intro@@ duc@@ ing the system of products for pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ al proc@@ ure@@ ment by government from small , medi@@ um and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es ; 
and through the Small Enter@@ pris@@ es Development Agency s@@ etting up a rig@@ or@@ ous system to ensure that the 30@@ -@@ day payment period is ob@@ serv@@ ed . 
We will also integr@@ ate the programme to spe@@ ed up the development of sustainable human sett@@ le@@ ments , with inten@@ si@@ fied ef@@ for@@ ts , as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ent pri@@ ority , to acceler@@ ate uni@@ ver@@ sal access to water , sanit@@ ation and elec@@ tricity , so that by 201@@ 4 , we should have dec@@ ent human sett@@ le@@ ments and access by all hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds to these services . 
Acc@@ eler@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ e@@ ment of a go@@ al of health for all includes inten@@ si@@ fied implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS . 
We also aim during the course of this year to re@@ duce t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ sis de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , tra@@ in over 3 000 health person@@ nel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi@@ -@@ dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant and ex@@ tre@@ me dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant TB patients receive treatment . 
We aim to complete the work on the com@@ prehensive social security system , benefit@@ ing from the consult@@ ations that have star@@ ted with social part@@ ners . 
As we put all our hand@@ s on de@@ ck and ge@@ ar our@@ sel@@ ves for Business Un@@ us@@ ual we should also inten@@ si@@ fy national di@@ al@@ og@@ ue on the issues that defin@@ e us as a n@@ ation . 
T@@ w@@ o such issues des@@ erve brief men@@ tion . 
The first of these is a pro@@ po@@ sal that we should develop an o@@ ath that will be re@@ ci@@ ted by learners in their mor@@ ning school ass@@ emb@@ lies , as well as a Youth P@@ le@@ dge ex@@ tol@@ ling the vir@@ tu@@ es of h@@ um@@ ane conduct and human soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity among all South Afric@@ ans . 
The Minister of Education will next week el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the national deb@@ ate on these matters . 
The second issue is about geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c and place names , which requi@@ res a syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process ac@@ ross all provinces so we can create a b@@ ase sla@@ te of changes we pro@@ pose . 
We will laun@@ ch this syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process soon , g@@ ui@@ ded by the South African Ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ical N@@ am@@ es Council and its provincial committees . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person , When we reflec@@ ted on the issue of crime at last years Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament , we all ex@@ pres@@ sed gr@@ ave concer@@ n not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indic@@ ation that th@@ ings se@@ em@@ ed to be tur@@ ning for the wor@@ se especially in respect of m@@ ur@@ der â b@@ uc@@ king the tr@@ end of the impro@@ vement sin@@ ce the at@@ tain@@ ment of demo@@ cracy . 
Acc@@ ord@@ ing@@ ly , last year we eng@@ aged in syste@@ mati@@ c inter@@ action with business and other sec@@ tors of the pop@@ ulation , to develop a ho@@ li@@ stic appro@@ ach towards re@@ v@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system in its to@@ ta@@ lity . 
In this regard , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Business Un@@ us@@ ual , Cabinet has agre@@ ed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , mo@@ der@@ n@@ ised , efficient and transform@@ ed criminal justice system . 
A@@ mon@@ g other th@@ ings , this will ent@@ ail s@@ etting up a new coordin@@ ating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , br@@ ing@@ ing together the judi@@ ci@@ ary and mag@@ istr@@ acy , the police , prosecu@@ tors , cor@@ rectional services and the Legal Aid Board , as well as other inter@@ ven@@ tions , including the em@@ powerment of the Community Police For@@ ums . 
As the H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers are aw@@ are , some of these initi@@ atives are already under way ; 
but we are certain that , if they are all car@@ ri@@ ed out in an integrated and comple@@ mentary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fi@@ ght against crime . 
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security C@@ l@@ us@@ ter will el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the details of this and other initi@@ atives during the course of next week . 
Inform@@ ed by the im@@ per@@ ative to inten@@ si@@ fy the off@@ ensive against organis@@ ed crime , as well as the recommend@@ ations of the K@@ h@@ am@@ pe@@ pe Ju@@ di@@ cial Commission on the func@@ tion@@ ing and loc@@ ation of the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations and continu@@ ing reflec@@ tions on this matter , including the re@@ form of the Cri@@ min@@ al Justice Sy@@ stem , we shall by the end of March this year , inter@@ act with Parliament on legislation and other deci@@ sive measures required further to en@@ h@@ ance our capacity to fi@@ ght organis@@ ed crime . 
What will continue to inform us as we take this ste@@ p will be the ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te commit@@ ment of government to fi@@ ght organis@@ ed crime and improve the management , eff@@ ici@@ ency and coordin@@ ation of our law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement ag@@ en@@ cies . 
Of gre@@ at import@@ ance , our succ@@ ess in the fi@@ ght against crime depend@@ s on coo@@ per@@ ation among all of us as law@@ -@@ ab@@ iding citizens , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the principles of r@@ ule of law , respect for our judi@@ ci@@ ary and p@@ urs@@ uit of equal human rights , which our Constitution en@@ jo@@ ins us to ob@@ serve in our da@@ ily li@@ ves and pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce@@ ments . 
If any@@ thing , the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Business Un@@ us@@ ual should apply to all individu@@ als who car@@ ry the pri@@ vi@@ lege of being public serv@@ ants . 
There are si@@ mp@@ le but ur@@ g@@ ent and cri@@ tical pri@@ or@@ ities we will atten@@ d to , as part of the over@@ all ef@@ for@@ t to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
Fir@@ st@@ ly , it has been agre@@ ed ac@@ ross all spher@@ es of government that especially the cri@@ tical vac@@ an@@ cies should be fil@@ led within six months of such op@@ en@@ ings emer@@ ging . 
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to trac@@ k the implementation of this decision . 
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , by May of every year all senior man@@ ag@@ ers should have fi@@ led their K@@ ey Per@@ form@@ ance Ag@@ ree@@ ments with relevant author@@ ities . 
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . 
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , recogn@@ ising that the Department of Home Affairs t@@ ou@@ ches the c@@ ore of every citizens life , we will this year inten@@ si@@ fy the implementation of the tur@@ n@@ around strategy approved by Cabinet . 
This includes impro@@ ving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ o@@ ting out cor@@ rup@@ t ele@@ ments and pil@@ o@@ ting the new ID card . 
Impro@@ vement of performance in the public service also depend@@ s on the quality of lea@@ ders@@ hip provided by the executive and senior management . 
F@@ ur@@ ther , it is cri@@ tical to en@@ h@@ ance the commit@@ ment of public employees to their duties â a t@@ ask that bel@@ on@@ gs to the lea@@ ders@@ hip , the public serv@@ ants them@@ sel@@ ves and the trade uni@@ on mo@@ vement . 
In this regard , this year , in consult@@ ation with public sector uni@@ ons , we will con@@ ven@@ e a Public Sector S@@ um@@ mit to th@@ ras@@ h out these issues so that the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Ba@@ th@@ o P@@ ele can find con@@ cre@@ te ex@@ pres@@ sion wh@@ er@@ ever a government service is provided . 
Wor@@ king with other social part@@ ners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National anti@@ cor@@ ruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agre@@ ed with organis@@ ed business is implemen@@ ted . 
At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anti@@ cor@@ ruption strateg@@ ies . 
We shall continue this year to inten@@ si@@ fy ef@@ for@@ ts to streng@@ then local government capacity in line with the 5-@@ year Local Government Strategic A@@ gen@@ da . 
To ensure syste@@ mati@@ c monitoring in this regard , SA@@ L@@ G@@ A has agre@@ ed to provide qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly reports on the work being done . 
In order further to improve the service being provided to vul@@ ner@@ able sec@@ tors such as v@@ eter@@ ans , women and youth , we shall review the structures deleg@@ ated to car@@ ry out these functions and exam@@ ine the most appropriate arran@@ ge@@ ments , including the evalu@@ ation of the government structures speci@@ fic@@ ally established to focus on youth development and em@@ powerment . 
M@@ any of the chall@@ eng@@ es in our work which we have identified deri@@ ve from serious we@@ ak@@ nesses in terms of our planning . 
Th@@ us , as part of our A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities in the com@@ ing period we will complete the processes that will en@@ able us to en@@ h@@ ance govern@@ ments capacity to put in place re@@ ali@@ stic and integrated plan@@ s , cover@@ ing all spher@@ es of government . 
The programme that we have out@@ lin@@ ed incorpor@@ ates the commit@@ ments that our country has agre@@ ed with the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the contin@@ ent through the African P@@ eer Re@@ view M@@ echan@@ is@@ m . 
O@@ ur focus , in promo@@ ting the African A@@ gen@@ da this year , will be on the streng@@ th@@ ening of the African institutions , including the African Uni@@ on and its development programme , Ne@@ pa@@ d . 
This we shall do , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the common asp@@ ir@@ ation of the pe@@ opl@@ es of the contin@@ ent for greater integr@@ ation in p@@ urs@@ uit of contin@@ ental un@@ ity at all levels . 
A cri@@ tical ste@@ p in this regard is the con@@ soli@@ d@@ ation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achiev@@ ing regional integr@@ ation . 
We continue to be commit@@ ted to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and h@@ ope to use our C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person@@ ship of SA@@ D@@ C in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 2009 further to give imp@@ et@@ us to the regional en@@ de@@ av@@ ours in this regard . 
It is in this con@@ text , as well , that we shall continue our bi@@ la@@ ter@@ al and multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al inter@@ ac@@ tions with our n@@ eighbour@@ s and the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , within the con@@ text of the process led by the African Uni@@ on , to ensure that the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the Economic Par@@ t@@ nership Ag@@ ree@@ ment are completed as soon as possible , premis@@ ed on acceler@@ ating the development of our reg@@ ion . 
O@@ ver the p@@ ast year , we car@@ ri@@ ed out the mand@@ ate of SA@@ D@@ C to assist the political lea@@ ders@@ hip of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we to find a la@@ sting so@@ lution to the political chall@@ eng@@ es they fac@@ e . 
We had an opportun@@ ity , on the fr@@ ing@@ es of the A@@ U S@@ um@@ mit in Ad@@ di@@ s A@@ bab@@ a form@@ ally to present a com@@ prehensive report to the lea@@ ders@@ hip of SA@@ D@@ C on this matter . 
In sh@@ ort , the parties involved in the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue have re@@ ached full agreement on all matters relating to the substan@@ tive matters the parties had to address . 
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and elec@@ toral laws , and other matters that have been in cont@@ en@@ tion for many years . 
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amend@@ ments . 
What is out@@ standing , ho@@ we@@ ver , is a proced@@ ural matter relating to the ti@@ ming and the manner of enac@@ tment of the new agre@@ ed Draft Constitution . 
Acc@@ ord@@ ing@@ ly , we jo@@ in the SA@@ D@@ C He@@ ads of State and Government in con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ ting the parties to the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we Di@@ al@@ og@@ ue for their tr@@ uly com@@ mend@@ able achiev@@ e@@ ments and encour@@ age them to work together to resol@@ ve the remain@@ ing proced@@ ural matter . 
As requ@@ ested by the SA@@ D@@ C He@@ ads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations . 
At the same time , we wish the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we succ@@ ess in the elec@@ tions sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led for the 29@@ th of March . 
O@@ ur multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ted relations with the Demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c Republic of Con@@ go will continue , as we se@@ ek to contribu@@ te to the ef@@ for@@ ts of the si@@ ster people of that country to at@@ tain la@@ sting pe@@ ace , and imple@@ ment their re@@ con@@ struction and development programme . 
O@@ ur government will remain s@@ ei@@ z@@ ed of the processes under way in K@@ eny@@ a , C@@ had , Bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , Dar@@ f@@ ur in the S@@ ud@@ an , Western S@@ a@@ har@@ a , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ i@@ re , S@@ om@@ ali@@ a , the Com@@ or@@ os and the Central African Republic to find la@@ sting pe@@ ace and st@@ ability . 
We call on all African com@@ pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts to do wh@@ ate@@ ver we can , together to help bring a stop to all these neg@@ ative develop@@ ments . 
We will , of course , continue to car@@ ry out our ta@@ sk@@ s in the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations Security Council . 
Cri@@ tical in this regard , is the streng@@ th@@ ening of coo@@ per@@ ation between the U@@ N Security Council and the Pe@@ ace and Security Council of the African Uni@@ on . 
I@@ mp@@ el@@ led by the desi@@ re to promote the impro@@ vement in the quality of life of all pe@@ opl@@ es , particul@@ arly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further streng@@ th@@ ening our participation in the In@@ di@@ a-@@ B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ -@@ South Africa for@@ ums , the New Afric@@ a-@@ A@@ si@@ a Strategic Par@@ t@@ nership , the N@@ on-@@ A@@ lig@@ ned Mo@@ vement , the G@@ rou@@ p of 77 and neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to complete the SA@@ C@@ U@@ -@@ M@@ erc@@ us@@ or trade agreement . 
In the same meas@@ ure , we shall continue to contribu@@ te to the re@@ alisation of the objec@@ tives of the K@@ y@@ o@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on C@@ li@@ mate C@@ han@@ ge and on@@ going impro@@ ve@@ ments in this regard , and in gi@@ ving further imp@@ et@@ us to the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the W@@ TO Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound . 
This year we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the ten@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the establish@@ ment of dipl@@ omati@@ c relations between South Africa and the Pe@@ opl@@ es Republic of Ch@@ ina . 
The m@@ us@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ ing of relations in a variety of areas between our govern@@ ments and pe@@ opl@@ es confir@@ ms that the Ch@@ in@@ a-@@ South Africa Par@@ t@@ nership for Gro@@ wth and Development is a strategi@@ c rel@@ ation@@ ship of mu@@ tual benefit , which can only gro@@ w from streng@@ th to streng@@ th . 
N@@ ex@@ t year , South Africa will pla@@ y ho@@ st to the Re@@ view Con@@ fer@@ ence to evalu@@ ate the implementation of the deci@@ sions of the World Con@@ fer@@ ence Ag@@ ain@@ st R@@ ac@@ is@@ m which was held in our country in 2001 . 
We are conf@@ ident that , inform@@ ed by their ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ence of the s@@ cour@@ ge of rac@@ is@@ m and the de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating con@@ sequ@@ ences it continu@@ es to ex@@ act on h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , the govern@@ ments and pe@@ opl@@ es of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Re@@ view Con@@ fer@@ ence achiev@@ es its objec@@ tives . 
These glob@@ al responsibi@@ lities , including the ho@@ sting of the 2010 FI@@ F@@ A So@@ cc@@ er World C@@ up , bring out in even b@@ ol@@ der re@@ li@@ ef the conf@@ id@@ ence that h@@ um@@ an@@ ity has in our country as a strategi@@ c pla@@ y@@ er in the no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ ours of all h@@ um@@ an@@ ity . 
B@@ ut we should not take this for granted . 
I am conf@@ ident that , under the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Inv@@ es@@ tment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other ag@@ en@@ cies we shall all put our hand@@ s on de@@ ck to communic@@ ate to the rest of the world the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of Business Un@@ us@@ ual , and our continu@@ ing adv@@ ance towards the cre@@ ation of a soci@@ ety that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to ga@@ ther in our country to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate Afric@@ as h@@ um@@ an@@ ity in 2010 . 
What I do know and her@@ e@@ by make b@@ old to sa@@ y is : wh@@ ate@@ ver the chall@@ eng@@ es of the mo@@ ment , we are still on course ! 
I sa@@ y this with un@@ sh@@ ake@@ able con@@ vic@@ tion because I am certain that South Afric@@ ans are capable and ge@@ ar@@ ed to meet the chall@@ en@@ ge of histor@@ y â to str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of our being â to respon@@ d to the national chall@@ eng@@ es of the day , including those relating to our econ@@ omy , the political and economic situ@@ ation in Africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world , and s@@ ei@@ z@@ e the opportunities that our countr@@ ys progres@@ s over the last f@@ our@@ teen years has provided . 
Wit@@ h all hand@@ s on de@@ ck , and commit@@ ted to conduct our business in an un@@ us@@ ual and more effective f@@ as@@ hi@@ on , we shall su@@ st@@ ain the process of our re@@ con@@ struction and development and take it to even higher levels .

I stand before the people of South Africa with h@@ um@@ i@@ lity at the opportun@@ ity I have had to occ@@ up@@ y the high@@ est office in the land as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of the uni@@ qu@@ e circum@@ stance ar@@ ising out of the decision of the le@@ ading party in government to rec@@ all the form@@ er President . 
Min@@ e is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to le@@ ad the National Executive in com@@ pl@@ eting the mand@@ ate accor@@ ded the African National Con@@ gres@@ s in the 2004 elec@@ tions , and in la@@ ying the f@@ oundation for the post@@ -@@ election administration to hi@@ t the groun@@ d r@@ un@@ ning . 
Th@@ at we were able five months ag@@ o to ensure a se@@ am@@ less tran@@ si@@ tion and continu@@ ity in the systems of government is th@@ an@@ ks to the mat@@ urity of our constitutional system , reflec@@ ted in part in the coo@@ per@@ ation of members of the Executive â old and new â and the ste@@ ad@@ y hand of our public sector man@@ ag@@ ers . 
As we l@@ ook back over the p@@ ast fi@@ f@@ teen years , I wish to ac@@ knowledge the commit@@ ment and h@@ ard work of Presid@@ ents N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ ela and Th@@ ab@@ o Mbek@@ i and the many women and m@@ en who pla@@ y@@ ed their role in ste@@ ering the ship of state under demo@@ cracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures ac@@ ross the three spher@@ es of government and the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary ; 
d@@ riv@@ en by the desi@@ re to improve the quality of life of all South Afric@@ ans . 
A@@ bo@@ ve all , I stand before you with pri@@ de and conf@@ id@@ ence that the South Africa we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate to@@ day â wor@@ l@@ ds ap@@ ar@@ t from the di@@ visi@@ ons , conflic@@ t and exclu@@ sion of a m@@ ere 15 years ag@@ o â is a product of the la@@ bour@@ s and to@@ il@@ s of South African women and m@@ en from all w@@ al@@ ks of life . 
These South Afric@@ ans repres@@ ent the h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence that character@@ ise our n@@ ation . 
W@@ i@@ th@@ in the g@@ al@@ ax@@ y of out@@ standing South Afric@@ ans are M@@ emb@@ ers of our demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c Parliament to whom we had the mis@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ e sin@@ ce last February to bi@@ d the fin@@ al f@@ are@@ well . 
They include B@@ ri@@ an B@@ un@@ ting , B@@ il@@ ly N@@ air , N@@ c@@ um@@ is@@ a K@@ ond@@ l@@ o , Joh@@ n G@@ om@@ om@@ o , Jo@@ e N@@ h@@ lan@@ h@@ l@@ a , C@@ as Sal@@ oo@@ j@@ ee , Joh@@ n Sch@@ i@@ p@@ per@@ s and Jan van E@@ ck . 
To these , I would also like to ad@@ d Ms Hel@@ en Su@@ z@@ man , a tr@@ uly di@@ st@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed South African , who repres@@ ented the values of our new Parliament in the ch@@ amb@@ ers of the old . 
It is these and other pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts who should take the gre@@ at@@ est share of the ac@@ co@@ la@@ de when we pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce that â wh@@ ate@@ ver economic stor@@ ms may p@@ ound our sh@@ or@@ es , wh@@ ate@@ ver political un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties may visit our collec@@ tive cons@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness in a tran@@ si@@ tion â our n@@ ation is in a good state . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , we should not under@@ esti@@ mate the chall@@ eng@@ es we fac@@ e . 
The glob@@ al economic mel@@ t@@ down does pose serious d@@ ang@@ ers for our econ@@ omy in terms of job los@@ ses and the quality of life of our people . 
Nat@@ ur@@ ally , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties of a political tran@@ si@@ tion can pose more ques@@ tions than there are currently an@@ sw@@ ers . 
As a con@@ sequ@@ ence , some of us may be m@@ es@@ m@@ eris@@ ed by the tran@@ si@@ ent wa@@ ves of stor@@ my we@@ a@@ ther and h@@ un@@ ch our s@@ hou@@ l@@ ders in the fac@@ e of these he@@ ad@@ win@@ ds of economic tur@@ bul@@ ence and political tu@@ m@@ ult . 
B@@ ut ours is a j@@ our@@ ney of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence . 
O@@ ur demo@@ cracy is health@@ y . 
It is ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly gro@@ wing str@@ on@@ ger , under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a Constitution har@@ d@@ ly equ@@ al@@ led in the world . 
In@@ de@@ ed , the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of our political eng@@ agement during this se@@ as@@ on of elec@@ toral cont@@ est â which we all ag@@ ree should be dig@@ ni@@ fied and pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul â is the sur@@ est guar@@ ante@@ e of the continu@@ ed sur@@ vi@@ val and de@@ ep@@ ening of our demo@@ cracy . 
It is South Afric@@ as people who have ens@@ ured its progres@@ s ; 
and it is they who shall sec@@ ure our demo@@ cracy in the years to come . 
Al@@ low me , M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person , in this con@@ text to ur@@ ge all e@@ lig@@ i@@ ble South Afric@@ ans to register and to vote in the com@@ ing national and provincial elec@@ tions , so that we can sh@@ ap@@ e our d@@ est@@ in@@ y our@@ sel@@ ves . 
This we should do every working day in the municipal offic@@ es , before the vo@@ ters ro@@ ll is clo@@ sed . 
B@@ ut we should also take advan@@ t@@ age of the special registration week@@ end arran@@ ged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w and Sun@@ day , the 7@@ th and 8@@ th of February respec@@ ti@@ vely . 
I should also take this opportun@@ ity to indic@@ ate that I will in the next few days conclu@@ de consult@@ ations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premi@@ ers and ann@@ oun@@ ce the date of the elec@@ tions . 
We o@@ we our being as a demo@@ cracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collec@@ ti@@ vely took their d@@ est@@ in@@ y into their own hand@@ s . 
Th@@ rough that si@@ mp@@ le but pro@@ found act of casting a bal@@ lo@@ t for a government of all the people of our country , we tur@@ ned our bac@@ ks on a p@@ ast that de@@ h@@ um@@ anis@@ ed us all . 
It is therefore appropriate on this occ@@ asi@@ on to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the adoption of the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of the O@@ A@@ U Ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c Committee on Southern Africa on the Qu@@ es@@ tion of South Africa adopted in August , 198@@ 9 â comm@@ only kno@@ wn as the Har@@ are Dec@@ lar@@ ation . 
Th@@ at initi@@ ative la@@ id the f@@ oundation for glob@@ al cons@@ ens@@ us , through the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations , on the appro@@ ach to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations in South Africa . 
W@@ i@@ th@@ in South Africa , it also inform@@ ed the content of the 198@@ 9 Con@@ fer@@ ence for a Demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c F@@ u@@ ture â br@@ ing@@ ing together pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts from vir@@ tu@@ ally all w@@ al@@ ks of life . 
All this led to the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations process which cul@@ min@@ ated in our first demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c elec@@ tions in 1994 . 
In this regard , we should s@@ alu@@ te the late President of the African National Con@@ gres@@ s , O@@ li@@ ver Reg@@ in@@ al@@ d T@@ amb@@ o , for initi@@ ating and pil@@ o@@ ting through contin@@ ental and world bo@@ dies what bec@@ ame a comp@@ as@@ s for the pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul resolution of the conflic@@ t in our country . 
Th@@ at cour@@ age@@ ous ste@@ p to de@@ v@@ ise a framework that would se@@ ek pe@@ ace and re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation , in the place of wa@@ r and conflic@@ t , re@@ vers@@ ed for good the f@@ al@@ se da@@ wn of a h@@ un@@ d@@ red years ag@@ o : that is , the conclu@@ sion in 19@@ 09 of the National Con@@ vention which pres@@ aged the formation of the Uni@@ on of South Africa . 
Whi@@ le that Con@@ vention defined the ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al integr@@ ity of South Africa as we know it to@@ day , it was based on ra@@ cial op@@ pres@@ sion and exclu@@ sion . 
Th@@ o@@ se f@@ ear@@ s and in@@ sec@@ uri@@ ties ga@@ ve r@@ ise to dec@@ ades of res@@ is@@ t@@ ance . 
In this regard , we s@@ alu@@ te that br@@ ave s@@ on of our people , S@@ ol@@ om@@ on K@@ al@@ us@@ h@@ i Ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u who w@@ ent to the g@@ allow@@ s 30 years ag@@ o with his head held high , in the pro@@ u@@ d knowledge that his bl@@ ood would n@@ ouris@@ h the tree of fre@@ edom . 
Al@@ low me to ac@@ knowledge L@@ uc@@ as Ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u , bro@@ ther of K@@ al@@ us@@ h@@ i , repres@@ enting the Ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u family . 
S@@ ol@@ om@@ on Ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u was continu@@ ing a tradi@@ tion of the war@@ ri@@ ors of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year , among whom we coun@@ t those under K@@ ing C@@ et@@ sh@@ way@@ o who in 18@@ 79 de@@ fe@@ ated the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h ar@@ my in Is@@ and@@ l@@ wan@@ a , in defence of the fre@@ edom of the indigenous people of our country and the s@@ over@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty of their lands . 
A h@@ un@@ d@@ red and thir@@ ty years on , we can only mar@@ vel at the h@@ ope and the res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used those st@@ out he@@ ar@@ ts . 
In the centres of learning , the same res@@ is@@ t@@ ance fu@@ el@@ led the re@@ kin@@ d@@ ling of mass str@@ ug@@ g@@ les during the col@@ d win@@ ter after the ban@@ ning of the li@@ ber@@ ation mo@@ vement and the im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment of most of its senior lea@@ ders@@ hip . 
A group of vali@@ ant stud@@ ents bro@@ ke a@@ way from NU@@ SA@@ S to found the South African Stu@@ d@@ ents Organis@@ ation 40 years ag@@ o . 
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this gener@@ ation are the early lea@@ ders of SA@@ S@@ O , which inclu@@ ded : Str@@ in@@ i M@@ ood@@ ley , Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or Bar@@ ney P@@ it@@ y@@ ana , Ste@@ ve B@@ ik@@ o , On@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ o@@ t@@ se T@@ ir@@ o , Har@@ ry N@@ eng@@ wek@@ hul@@ u , Th@@ emb@@ a Son@@ o , M@@ ap@@ et@@ l@@ a Mo@@ h@@ ap@@ i , Mo@@ si@@ ou@@ a L@@ ek@@ o@@ ta , Joh@@ n@@ n@@ y Is@@ sel and M@@ th@@ ul@@ i ka S@@ he@@ z@@ i . 
For in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing h@@ ope in a period of des@@ pai@@ r , we s@@ alu@@ te them . 
In this regard , we wish to ac@@ knowledge On@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ o@@ t@@ se T@@ i@@ ro@@ s c@@ ou@@ si@@ n , P@@ at T@@ l@@ h@@ ag@@ wan@@ a . 
In this con@@ text we also wish to ac@@ knowledge the late E@@ ph@@ r@@ aim Mo@@ g@@ ale , the f@@ oun@@ ding President 30 years ag@@ o of the Con@@ gres@@ s of South African Stu@@ d@@ ents , and his pe@@ ers . 
In the to@@ w@@ ering m@@ em@@ ory of these stud@@ ents of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year resid@@ es an ab@@ iding m@@ ess@@ age , that the thir@@ st for fre@@ edom and knowledge bur@@ ns even str@@ on@@ ger in the bos@@ oms of our youth . 
The m@@ ess@@ age of their her@@ o@@ ic de@@ eds r@@ ings tr@@ ue to@@ day as it di@@ d those many years ag@@ o , that we should together exp@@ and the f@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers of opportun@@ ity ; 
that we should in@@ de@@ ed , in the word@@ s of the F@@ re@@ edom Char@@ ter , open ever wid@@ er the d@@ oor@@ s of learning and of culture ! 
We call to min@@ d these organisations and lea@@ ders to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c str@@ ug@@ g@@ le even when ever@@ y@@ thing loo@@ ked ble@@ ak ; 
We do have to@@ day a well@@ -@@ func@@ tion@@ ing demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c system , based on principles of trans@@ par@@ ency and op@@ enn@@ ess , with num@@ er@@ ous plat@@ forms for public participation and independent institutions mand@@ ated by the Constitution to support demo@@ cracy . 
O@@ ver the years , we have ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly impro@@ ved the structures of govern@@ ance . 
We have buil@@ t a system of health@@ y inter@@ govern@@ mental relations ac@@ ross the spher@@ es , and impro@@ ved integr@@ ation within and among them . 
In@@ de@@ ed , government can be pro@@ u@@ d that we have chan@@ ged the demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c com@@ position of the public service , which in vir@@ tu@@ ally all respec@@ ts appro@@ xim@@ ates the charac@@ ter of our soci@@ ety . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , while women constitu@@ te about 34 of all senior posi@@ tions in the public service , this f@@ al@@ ls sh@@ ort of the tar@@ get of par@@ ity that we had set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indi@@ cations are that the n@@ ation will this year sur@@ pas@@ s the 32 women represent@@ ation level achiev@@ ed in 2004 and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , even the 40 achiev@@ ed in the 2006 local government elec@@ tions . 
We h@@ ope that all political parties will , as they fin@@ ali@@ se their elec@@ toral li@@ sts , make their contribu@@ tion to this no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ our ! 
Th@@ ough some progres@@ s has been made , at 0@@ ,@@ 2 , the situ@@ ation is less im@@ pres@@ sive with regard to people with dis@@ ability employed in government , meas@@ ured against the 2 tar@@ get we set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
On both coun@@ ts , the private sector is lag@@ ging f@@ ar be@@ hin@@ d . 
V@@ ari@@ ous measures have been put in place to improve the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the public service , including financial management , Th@@ us@@ ong Service Centres and other service delivery in@@ nov@@ ations , iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , fir@@ m lea@@ ders@@ hip . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and ori@@ ent@@ ation of some public serv@@ ants , especially those at the co@@ al-@@ fac@@ e of direct inter@@ action with the public . 
As H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers will be aw@@ are , our government has made the fi@@ ght against cor@@ ruption one of the c@@ ore areas of focus . 
This is reflec@@ ted , among oth@@ ers , in legislation , rules and regulations govern@@ ing public serv@@ ants and political offic@@ e-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers a@@ like , part@@ nershi@@ ps with civil soci@@ ety and the business community , as well as anti@@ -@@ cor@@ ruption ho@@ t@@ lin@@ es . 
The same chall@@ eng@@ es conf@@ ron@@ t the private sector . 
I am certain that we are all agre@@ ed that the well@@ being of our soci@@ ety depend@@ s , cri@@ tic@@ ally , on the progres@@ s we make in exp@@ and@@ ing the n@@ ations we@@ alth and ens@@ uring that the benefits of economic growth are shar@@ ed by the people as a who@@ le . 
It is common c@@ ause that , after the economic st@@ ag@@ n@@ ation of the late 19@@ 80@@ s and early 199@@ 0@@ s , South Africa has experi@@ enc@@ ed the lon@@ ges@@ t period of sustain@@ ed economic growth sin@@ ce the recor@@ ding of such statisti@@ cs star@@ ted in 19@@ 40 . 
In the Fir@@ st De@@ ca@@ de of F@@ re@@ edom , economic growth a@@ ver@@ aged 3 per year , and this impro@@ ved to 5 per year on a@@ ver@@ age from 2004 to 2007 . 
Whi@@ le the consum@@ er boo@@ m , imp@@ el@@ led by ris@@ ing employment and in@@ comes and low inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates , pla@@ y@@ ed its part in this regard , we are encour@@ aged by the bro@@ ad can@@ vas@@ s of opportunities for further exp@@ an@@ sion going for@@ ward . 
These include , in the first in@@ stance , higher rates of inves@@ tment by both the public and private sec@@ tors . 
In this regard , some five years ag@@ o , we were h@@ over@@ ing around 16 of gro@@ ss fix@@ ed capital formation as a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of Gro@@ ss D@@ om@@ estic Pro@@ duc@@ t . Su@@ ch has been the acceler@@ ation in inves@@ tment that to@@ day this fi@@ g@@ ure stand@@ s at 22 , clo@@ s@@ er to the 25 that we projec@@ ted to at@@ tain only in 201@@ 4 . 
This is in part a con@@ sequ@@ ence of deli@@ ber@@ ate programmes by government to exp@@ and public infrastructure . 
It is also a result of policies to improve the cli@@ mate for private sector inv@@ est@@ ments ; 
and to conduct fis@@ cal and mon@@ et@@ ary policy in a manner that exp@@ and@@ s access to services and re@@ duc@@ es the inf@@ l@@ ation@@ ary bur@@ den while at the same time ens@@ uring m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic st@@ ability and sustain@@ ability . 
The focus on micro@@ -@@ economic re@@ forms in the p@@ ast dec@@ ade , and the ef@@ for@@ ts , especially sin@@ ce 2004 more syste@@ mati@@ cally to remo@@ ve the variety of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to growth have had a positive impact . 
It is in this con@@ text that the Acc@@ eler@@ ated and S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth Ini@@ ti@@ ative is being implemen@@ ted , ens@@ uring that all the cri@@ tical b@@ loc@@ k@@ ages such as infrastructure bo@@ tt@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , integrated indus@@ trial policy and programmes , the skills chall@@ en@@ ge , regula@@ tory g@@ rid@@ loc@@ ks and eff@@ ici@@ ency of government services are addres@@ sed in a foc@@ uss@@ ed and syste@@ mati@@ c manner . 
O@@ ur econ@@ omy has become more open , and sin@@ ce 1994 it has ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly become integrated into the glob@@ al system . 
O@@ ur financial institutions are a force of good example which has some@@ what sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed us from the glob@@ al economic stor@@ ms . 
Y@@ et , the extent of their re@@ ach within our soci@@ ety remain@@ s f@@ ar below exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations . 
O@@ ur econ@@ omy remain@@ s lar@@ gel@@ y re@@ li@@ ant on min@@ ing and agric@@ ulture for ex@@ ports . 
Ex@@ c@@ ept for the services sector , we have not se@@ en a lar@@ ge en@@ ough exp@@ an@@ sion in cri@@ tical sec@@ tors , especially manufac@@ t@@ uring . 
As such , the rate of growth in ex@@ ports has not been as high as in com@@ par@@ able countries . 
It is prec@@ is@@ ely this we@@ ak@@ ness which accoun@@ ts for the lar@@ ge C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent Ac@@ coun@@ t def@@ ici@@ t particul@@ arly when we enter@@ ed higher ran@@ ges of growth . 
And because we have a low sav@@ ings rate , we have had to re@@ ly on sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term capital f@@ low@@ s to fin@@ ance the def@@ ici@@ t as well as our inves@@ tment programmes . 
These are chall@@ eng@@ es that our country will cer@@ tain@@ ly have to address going for@@ ward . 
Of cri@@ tical import@@ ance is the ques@@ tion : what in f@@ act should economic growth be about ?
We@@ alth is cre@@ ated in order to improve pe@@ opl@@ es quality of life . 
Th@@ us , the ques@@ tion whether growth is eq@@ uit@@ ably shar@@ ed should form a c@@ entral pil@@ lar of all our economic consider@@ ations . 
Im@@ port@@ an@@ tly , sharing the benefits of growth should ent@@ ail la@@ bour@@ -@@ ab@@ s@@ or@@ ption , ens@@ uring that there is dec@@ ent work . 
In this la@@ t@@ ter period , for the first time sin@@ ce the at@@ tain@@ ment of demo@@ cracy , more j@@ ob@@ s were being cre@@ ated than the number of new entr@@ ants into the labour market , th@@ us re@@ duc@@ ing the un@@ employment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . 
Of course , this should not de@@ tract from our oblig@@ ation to continue inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating the issue of the quality of these j@@ ob@@ s , including the rights and benefits that workers en@@ jo@@ y . 
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth should also include acceler@@ ated implementation of affir@@ m@@ ative action , including Bro@@ ad@@ -@@ based Black Economic Empowerment . 
This is not in p@@ urs@@ uit of a so@@ -@@ called ra@@ cial ag@@ end@@ a . 
In re@@ ality , a country that does not ensure the invol@@ vement of all of its pop@@ ulation at all levels of economic activ@@ ity is cer@@ tain@@ ly going to perform well below its ac@@ tual potential . 
The f@@ act that the private sector lag@@ s be@@ hin@@ d in chan@@ ging the demo@@ graph@@ ics of management and sk@@ il@@ led occ@@ up@@ ations , in enter@@ prise development and so on in part mak@@ es our country a lag@@ g@@ ard in the high growth st@@ ak@@ es . 
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and eq@@ uitable role for the state in using the fis@@ c@@ us as an instru@@ ment of re@@ distribu@@ tion and sharing the bur@@ den of providing public goods . 
H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers will be famili@@ ar with most of the data on matters relating to the social w@@ age . 
I will ho@@ we@@ ver ci@@ te a few in@@ stan@@ ces ag@@ ain to sk@@ et@@ ch out the nature of the progres@@ s we have made and the chall@@ eng@@ es that we fac@@ e . 
We have in the p@@ ast 15 years done our best to att@@ ac@@ k this s@@ cour@@ ge through the social w@@ age . 
To qu@@ o@@ te work conduc@@ ted by a te@@ am of ac@@ ade@@ mic@@ s at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or S@@ erv@@ aa@@ s van der Ber@@ g : 
Fir@@ st@@ ly , mon@@ e@@ y-@@ me@@ tric p@@ over@@ ty dec@@ lin@@ ed substan@@ ti@@ ally sin@@ ce the tur@@ n of the c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y . 
The re@@ duction is to a lar@@ ge extent due to a dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c exp@@ an@@ sion in social gr@@ ants exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture from 2002 on@@ wards . 
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , the d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics under@@ ly@@ ing the p@@ over@@ ty and in@@ equ@@ ality tr@@ ends determine the bro@@ ad policy out@@ l@@ ook p@@ over@@ ty has de@@ cre@@ ased sin@@ ce the tran@@ si@@ tion , but in@@ equ@@ ality has not impro@@ ved . 
On a cri@@ tical matter of det@@ ail , the res@@ earch@@ ers further ob@@ serve : 
The pre@@ val@@ ence of h@@ un@@ ger among children has vir@@ tu@@ ally hal@@ ved over four years . 
In@@ de@@ ed , these ob@@ serv@@ ations are confir@@ med by our own research , which sho@@ ws that income p@@ over@@ ty especially among African and Col@@ ou@@ red communities has dec@@ lin@@ ed , part@@ ly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social gr@@ ants . 
Whi@@ le the number of grant benef@@ ici@@ aries was 2,@@ 5-@@ million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increas@@ ed to 12@@ ,@@ 4-@@ million . 
This is lar@@ gel@@ y a result of m@@ assi@@ ve exp@@ an@@ sion in access to the Child Support G@@ ran@@ t , which increas@@ ed from 34@@ -@@ th@@ ous@@ and benef@@ ici@@ aries in 1999 to 8@@ ,@@ 1-@@ million in 2008 . 
As part of the contribu@@ tion to the income of the poor , the tar@@ get for 1-@@ million work opportunities through the Ex@@ pan@@ ded Public Works Programme was at@@ tained in 2008 , a year ear@@ lier than envisaged in the 2004 elec@@ toral mand@@ ate . 
This has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibi@@ lity m@@ assi@@ vely to exp@@ and this programme and improve its quality . 
Wit@@ h regard to hou@@ se@@ hold access to basic services , the fi@@ g@@ ures spe@@ ak for them@@ sel@@ ves . 
and sanit@@ ation . 
E@@ vid@@ ence of the social w@@ age is also se@@ en in m@@ assi@@ ve impro@@ ve@@ ments in access to primary health facilities . 
Child immunis@@ ation cover@@ age has ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly increas@@ ed to about 85 ; 
and mal@@ ari@@ a cases have m@@ assi@@ vely dec@@ lin@@ ed . 
We are also he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed that research into HIV pre@@ val@@ ence de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates st@@ abi@@ lis@@ ation and a s@@ light re@@ duction in rates of infec@@ tion . 
Y@@ et many health facilities do not al@@ ways have the required medic@@ ines , appropriate st@@ aff@@ ing levels , and con@@ st@@ ant supp@@ ly of basic services such as c@@ le@@ an r@@ un@@ ning water and elec@@ tricity . 
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des need impro@@ vement . 
In education , we have se@@ en a dro@@ p in the educ@@ ator : lear@@ ner r@@ ati@@ o ; 
At the same time , much ef@@ for@@ t has been put into impro@@ ving infrastructure in poor areas . 
Of course we do know that the dro@@ p@@ out rate particul@@ arly at sec@@ ondary and tertiary levels is un@@ accep@@ tab@@ ly high , and the educ@@ ational system has y@@ et to produce the requi@@ site kin@@ ds of skills nee@@ ded by soci@@ ety . 
In addi@@ tion , tr@@ ends in performance , both in terms of teach@@ ing and learning , s@@ how a wor@@ ry@@ ing per@@ si@@ st@@ ence of the social di@@ visi@@ ons of the p@@ ast . 
I@@ ron@@ ically , prec@@ is@@ ely where education is most nee@@ ded to help bre@@ ak the c@@ yc@@ le of p@@ over@@ ty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teach@@ er capacity are least im@@ pres@@ sive . 
Govern@@ ments social programmes have also impro@@ ved the ass@@ et b@@ ase of the poor , in the form of housing â with 2,@@ 6-@@ million subsi@@ dis@@ ed hou@@ ses provided . 
We should of course ac@@ knowledge that the land re@@ distribu@@ tion programme as well as post@@ -@@ sett@@ lement support could have been hand@@ led f@@ aster and better . 
Over@@ all , we are pro@@ u@@ d of the advan@@ ces in our social programmes . 
B@@ ut we cannot s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy our@@ sel@@ ves mer@@ ely with quanti@@ t@@ ative change . 
B@@ e it in education , health , housing , water or sanit@@ ation , the c@@ entral ques@@ tion that conf@@ ron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
On this we still have some way to go . 
The s@@ cour@@ ge of crime remain@@ s a maj@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of in@@ security for South Afric@@ ans . 
D@@ ail@@ y experi@@ ence , in poor and aff@@ lu@@ ent n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds a@@ like , is one of app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion at the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of viol@@ ent att@@ ac@@ k . 
W@@ i@@ th@@ in public and private institutions , the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of ne@@ f@@ ari@@ ous schem@@ es si@@ ph@@ on@@ ing off resources through cor@@ ruption is al@@ ways a s@@ our@@ ce of gre@@ at concer@@ n 
Of course , the over@@ all crime rate , having pe@@ ak@@ ed in 2002 , has consist@@ ently dec@@ lin@@ ed . 
All kin@@ ds of statisti@@ cs can be ci@@ ted to att@@ est to this . 
B@@ ut we do know that the re@@ duction has not been f@@ ast en@@ ough , not even at the 7-@@ 10 rate that we set our@@ sel@@ ves for various categories of contact crime . 
This poin@@ ts to we@@ ak@@ nesses in our n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , especially in building the b@@ onds of community soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity that would assist us in preven@@ ting and com@@ b@@ ating crime . 
It poin@@ ts to we@@ ak@@ nesses in the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
These are the issues that the com@@ prehensive re@@ v@@ amp of the criminal justice system has star@@ ted to address . 
Y@@ et , in being bru@@ t@@ ally self@@ -@@ cri@@ tical , we should not lo@@ se si@@ ght of the f@@ act that what we are assess@@ ing is a system that en@@ jo@@ ys , by f@@ ar , better leg@@ iti@@ m@@ acy than ever experi@@ enc@@ ed in our country . 
This is because of the trans@@ formation these institutions have under@@ g@@ one , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights culture , their demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c com@@ position , and their systems of accoun@@ t@@ ability . 
B@@ ut let us not del@@ u@@ de our@@ sel@@ ves : as with the rest of our social life , such trans@@ formation is still at its n@@ as@@ cent st@@ ages . 
We still have a long way to go . 
I am certain that H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers will ag@@ ree that the h@@ um@@ an@@ ity of our demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c disp@@ ensation should find ex@@ pres@@ sion in the extent to which we pay atten@@ tion to the most vul@@ ner@@ able in soci@@ ety . 
In this regard , we have through legislation , international con@@ ven@@ tions , regulations and c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s ens@@ ured that con@@ cre@@ te ef@@ for@@ ts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with dis@@ ability and the el@@ der@@ ly . 
Th@@ rough ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s and in@@ de@@ ed as a result of the part@@ nershi@@ ps we have buil@@ t with organisations repres@@ enting these vul@@ ner@@ able group@@ s , we have impro@@ ved awareness around issues that affec@@ t them ; 
and progres@@ si@@ vely encour@@ aged the main@@ stre@@ am@@ ing of these concer@@ ns . 
It is a matter of pro@@ u@@ d record that , for in@@ stance , f@@ em@@ al@@ e-@@ he@@ a@@ ded hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds have received a bi@@ g@@ ger@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ a@@ ver@@ age share of the social w@@ age including housing and health care ; 
and that among the most success@@ ful programmes have been c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s on child immunis@@ ation and nu@@ tri@@ tion . 
Y@@ et access to employment w@@ eigh@@ s he@@ avi@@ ly on rural women , youth and people with dis@@ ability . 
HIV imp@@ acts most se@@ ver@@ ely on young women . 
Vi@@ ol@@ ence against women and children is much to@@ o high . 
All these are assi@@ gn@@ ments for the com@@ ing period . 
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ aker and H@@ on@@ our@@ able C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person ; 
There is no g@@ ain@@ sa@@ ying that , by any meas@@ ure , the progres@@ s made sin@@ ce 1994 has been im@@ pres@@ sive . 
B@@ ut n@@ either can there be d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the chall@@ eng@@ es remain im@@ mense . 
It is ap@@ t therefore to re@@ min@@ d our@@ sel@@ ves of that in@@ struc@@ tive ob@@ serv@@ ation of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence , continu@@ ity and change , by form@@ er President N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ ela , in his bio@@ grap@@ hy , L@@ ong W@@ alk to F@@ re@@ edom : 
I have w@@ alk@@ ed that long road to fre@@ edom . 
I have made mis@@ ste@@ ps al@@ ong the way . 
B@@ ut I have dis@@ cover@@ ed the sec@@ re@@ t that after cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing a gre@@ at h@@ ill , one only fin@@ ds that there are many more h@@ ills to cli@@ m@@ b . 
I have taken a mo@@ ment here to rest , to ste@@ al a view of the g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous vis@@ ta that sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds me , to l@@ ook back on the di@@ stance I have come . 
B@@ ut I can rest only for a mo@@ ment , for with fre@@ edom comes responsibi@@ lities , and I d@@ are not ling@@ er , for my long w@@ alk is not y@@ et en@@ ded . 
In a few months from now the people of our country will pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce on the lea@@ ders@@ hip they pre@@ fer to car@@ ry for@@ ward the no@@ ble work of this gre@@ at fre@@ edom fi@@ gh@@ ter and other f@@ oun@@ ders of our demo@@ cracy . 
Whi@@ le our appro@@ ach@@ es may di@@ ff@@ er , the objec@@ tives that we need to aim for are clear@@ ly and un@@ am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ously set out in our Constitution : to create a uni@@ ted , non@@ ra@@ cial , non@@ s@@ exis@@ t , demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c and pro@@ sper@@ ous soci@@ ety that pla@@ ys a positive role in building a better world . 
Si@@ x years ag@@ o , lea@@ ders of our people c@@ ame together in a Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit and re@@ ached agreement on the ta@@ sk@@ s all of us should under@@ take to improve the quality of life of South Afric@@ ans , particul@@ arly to hal@@ ve un@@ employment and p@@ over@@ ty by 201@@ 4 . 
addres@@ sing the inves@@ tment chall@@ en@@ ge by impro@@ ving sav@@ ings , appropri@@ ately de@@ ploy@@ ing resources from pen@@ sion and provi@@ d@@ ent fun@@ ds , housing , financial sector contribu@@ tions and black economic em@@ powerment ; 
die bevordering van gelykheid , die ontwikkeling van vaardighede , die skep van ekonomiese geleenthede en die uit@@ breiding van dienste , 
I am certain , that , as part of and in addi@@ tion to , these objec@@ tives South Afric@@ ans would har@@ d@@ ly di@@ ff@@ er regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
to provide efficient , dec@@ ent and eq@@ uitable health care ; 
and to inten@@ si@@ fy the fi@@ ght against crime and cor@@ ruption . 
I ci@@ te these issues not because they are all@@ -@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing n@@ or that by identi@@ f@@ ying them we would c@@ ure all the ills of our soci@@ ety . 
R@@ a@@ ther , I have ch@@ os@@ en to do so to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se the poin@@ t that South Africa does not suff@@ er the p@@ over@@ ty of visi@@ ons . 
O@@ ur chall@@ en@@ ge is to trans@@ late these visi@@ ons into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
These ide@@ als are shar@@ ed by vir@@ tu@@ ally all of h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , as reflec@@ ted in the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ als . 
And y@@ et h@@ um@@ an@@ ity to@@ day fac@@ es the d@@ ang@@ er that the at@@ tain@@ ment of these objec@@ tives could be post@@ pon@@ ed by many years , if not dec@@ ades , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of the economic cri@@ sis that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the glob@@ al vil@@ la@@ ge . 
What , on the sur@@ fac@@ e , star@@ ted off as a financial cri@@ sis among a few len@@ ding institutions has ex@@ plo@@ ded into a glob@@ al cre@@ dit cr@@ un@@ ch , with se@@ ver@@ e con@@ sequ@@ ences for ac@@ tual production and trade . 
We can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of man@@ ag@@ ers of bi@@ g corpor@@ ations which pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the cri@@ sis . 
We can con@@ de@@ m@@ n the policies of govern@@ ments which took their e@@ y@@ es off the b@@ all and allow@@ ed the rap@@ aci@@ ous licence of un@@ regula@@ ted mark@@ ets to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on financial systems . 
Y@@ et our c@@ entral and immedi@@ ate t@@ ask is fully to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the con@@ sequ@@ ences of these develop@@ ments on our own econ@@ omy and our reg@@ ion , and de@@ v@@ ise respon@@ ses that will minim@@ ise their impact especially on the most vul@@ ner@@ able sec@@ tors of our soci@@ ety . 
What we do know is that the regula@@ tory environment in our country and the coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ yc@@ lic@@ al bud@@ get policies we adopted have hel@@ p@@ ed us a@@ vo@@ id the wor@@ st impact of the cri@@ sis . 
B@@ ut we are all to@@ o aw@@ are that , because we are str@@ ong@@ ly integrated into the world econ@@ omy , de@@ m@@ and for our ex@@ ports has dec@@ lin@@ ed ; 
access to fin@@ ance and inf@@ low@@ s of capital have tur@@ ned for the wor@@ se ; 
low@@ er de@@ m@@ and has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated a sc@@ aling down of production ; 
the cre@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s is neg@@ ati@@ vely affected and in some sec@@ tors re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment has become a re@@ ality . 
These diffic@@ ul@@ ties have co@@ in@@ ci@@ ded with a period in which inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates are still to@@ o high . 
Com@@ bin@@ ed , these develop@@ ments bo@@ de ill for the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es we need to exp@@ and the provision of services and to imple@@ ment our infrastructure projects . 
As such , we have been for@@ ced to t@@ one down our for@@ ec@@ ast@@ s in terms of growth and j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
We know to@@ o that South Africa is less se@@ ver@@ ely affected than many other countries . 
In@@ de@@ ed , in a period in which oth@@ ers are experi@@ enc@@ ing or projec@@ ting rec@@ es@@ sions , South Africa and the rest of the contin@@ ent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a s@@ low@@ er rate . 
In this regard , H@@ on@@ our@@ able M@@ emb@@ ers , I am happ@@ y to report that in the inter@@ ac@@ tions between The Presid@@ ency and lea@@ ders of various social part@@ ners , we agre@@ ed jo@@ in@@ tly to de@@ v@@ ise inter@@ ven@@ tions that would minim@@ ise the impact of this cri@@ sis on our soci@@ ety . 
Fir@@ st@@ ly , government will continue with its public inves@@ tment projects , the value of which has increas@@ ed to R@@ 69@@ 0@@ -@@ b@@ illi@@ on for the next three years . 
In this regard , where necessary , we will find cre@@ ative ways to ra@@ ise fun@@ ds . 
This will include support by our development fin@@ ance institutions and lo@@ an fin@@ ance from international ag@@ en@@ cies , as well as part@@ nership with the private sector and u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of resources controlled by workers such as pen@@ sion fun@@ ds . 
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , we will inten@@ si@@ fy public sector employment programmes . 
On the one hand , plan@@ s to exp@@ and employment in sec@@ tors such as health , social work , education and law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement ag@@ en@@ cies will continue . 
On the other , we will spe@@ ed up the intro@@ duction of the next phase of the Ex@@ pan@@ ded Public Works Programme . 
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , mi@@ tig@@ ating ac@@ tions can be under@@ taken within the private sector to coun@@ ter@@ act an ex@@ ces@@ sive inves@@ tment s@@ low@@ down and un@@ necessary clo@@ su@@ res of production lin@@ es or plan@@ ts . 
On its part , government will ad@@ ap@@ t indus@@ trial fin@@ anc@@ ing and inc@@ enti@@ ve instru@@ ments to help deal with chall@@ eng@@ es in various sec@@ tors , and also encour@@ age development fin@@ ance institutions to assist fir@@ ms in distr@@ ess because of the cri@@ sis . 
Al@@ tern@@ atives to la@@ y@@ off@@ s will be ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ed , including longer ho@@ li@@ days , exten@@ ded training , sh@@ ort time and j@@ ob@@ -sharing . 
This will be com@@ bin@@ ed with promotion of the Pro@@ ud@@ ly South Africa c@@ ampaign and str@@ on@@ ger action on il@@ legal im@@ ports . 
F@@ our@@ th@@ ly , government will su@@ st@@ ain and exp@@ and social exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture , including progres@@ si@@ vely exten@@ ding access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and re@@ duc@@ ing the age of e@@ lig@@ i@@ bility for old age pen@@ sion to 60 years for m@@ en . 
In addi@@ tion , we will more wid@@ ely u@@ ti@@ li@@ se the Social Distr@@ ess Re@@ li@@ ef G@@ ran@@ t and food security measures speci@@ fic@@ ally also to tar@@ get those either un@@ protec@@ ted by the U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ment In@@ sur@@ ance Fund or who have ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted their benefits . 
We shall also continue to pay special atten@@ tion to the chall@@ en@@ ge of anti@@ competi@@ tive be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our on the part of some of our corpor@@ ations . 
In this regard , we wish to com@@ men@@ d the Com@@ peti@@ tion Commission for the fir@@ m hand that they are sho@@ wing to ensure that cul@@ pr@@ its are b@@ rou@@ ght to b@@ ook . 
We do h@@ ope th@@ ough that civil soci@@ ety will en@@ h@@ ance its own level of acti@@ vis@@ m to ensure , among other th@@ ings , that as in@@ put p@@ ric@@ es dec@@ line , the benefit is f@@ el@@ t by the pop@@ ulation . 
These immedi@@ ate measures will be inform@@ ed by the prin@@ cip@@ le of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ yc@@ lic@@ al fis@@ cal policy . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , we will ensure that the levels of bor@@ ro@@ wing by government are pr@@ ud@@ ent and sustainable . 
This also imp@@ lies a rap@@ id re@@ duction in government deb@@ t levels wh@@ en@@ ever conditions tur@@ n for the better . 
O@@ ur ef@@ for@@ ts will also be inform@@ ed by the app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation that measures to protect the environment and mi@@ tig@@ ate the impact of cli@@ mate change can also contribu@@ te to j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
Bo@@ th in the G@@ 20 me@@ et@@ ings and other inter@@ ac@@ tions in multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al institutions , our government has ar@@ gu@@ ed for appropriate and ur@@ g@@ ent inter@@ ven@@ tions particul@@ arly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the cri@@ sis origin@@ ated and where it is most se@@ ver@@ e . 
Cri@@ tic@@ ally , we should also saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the integr@@ ity of the world trade system , complete the current neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the Do@@ ha R@@ ound of world trade neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , and ensure that development aid is not s@@ cal@@ ed down . 
In our own country , we will emb@@ ar@@ k on these under@@ tak@@ ings as part of the process of s@@ etting our soci@@ ety on a higher growth and development p@@ ath . 
The l@@ eng@@ th of time towards at@@ taining a higher tra@@ jec@@ tory may have been st@@ ret@@ ch@@ ed some@@ what . 
B@@ ut we are not in d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that that mo@@ ment will y@@ et come so@@ on@@ er ra@@ ther than later . 
In this regard , how we position our country to take advan@@ t@@ age of uni@@ qu@@ e opportunities that have come our way , will be of par@@ amount import@@ ance . 
I ref@@ er here in particular to the FI@@ F@@ A World C@@ up in 2010 as well as the Con@@ fe@@ der@@ ations C@@ up a few months from now . 
V@@ ir@@ tu@@ ally all the projects and plan@@ s are completed or ne@@ aring comple@@ tion â from sta@@ di@@ a , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommod@@ ation , to health and im@@ migr@@ ation plan@@ s â confir@@ ming the conf@@ id@@ ence of the glob@@ al so@@ cc@@ er f@@ ra@@ ternity that ours will be a tr@@ uly success@@ ful t@@ our@@ na@@ ment . 
And we be@@ li@@ eve that , after five con@@ secu@@ tive win@@ s , the national so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am is now more conf@@ id@@ ently ge@@ aring it@@ self to perform above exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations ! 
B@@ ut be@@ y@@ ond this , the tr@@ ue leg@@ acy of this spec@@ t@@ ac@@ le will be in our ability to sho@@ wc@@ ase South African and African hospit@@ ality and h@@ um@@ an@@ ity â to change once and for all per@@ c@@ ep@@ tions of our country and our contin@@ ent among pe@@ opl@@ es of the world . 
We also wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te all our spor@@ ting te@@ ams which have ass@@ er@@ ted South Afric@@ as p@@ urs@@ uit of exc@@ ell@@ ence over the p@@ ast year . 
Special ac@@ co@@ la@@ des are due to our c@@ ric@@ k@@ et te@@ am which has cli@@ m@@ bed to the ap@@ e@@ x of glob@@ al rank@@ ings . 
We are of course R@@ ug@@ by World Ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons ; 
G@@ in@@ i@@ el de Villi@@ ers and his te@@ am have w@@ on the D@@ ak@@ ar R@@ ally ; 
our Par@@ al@@ y@@ mp@@ i@@ ans continue to do us pro@@ u@@ d ; 
and our under@@ -@@ 20 so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am di@@ d qui@@ te well in an ex@@ tre@@ mel@@ y competi@@ tive environment . 
J@@ ust two weeks ag@@ o , South Africa completed with Mal@@ i part of the ar@@ chi@@ ves to pres@@ erve the an@@ ci@@ ent man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of T@@ im@@ bu@@ k@@ t@@ u . 
This ric@@ h heritage poin@@ ts to Africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of sci@@ ence and liter@@ ature , ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy and comm@@ er@@ ce , inter@@ rup@@ ted by the sla@@ ve trade and the s@@ cr@@ am@@ ble for Afric@@ as we@@ alth . 
This initi@@ ative should sp@@ ur us on to act in concer@@ t with other countries on our contin@@ ent and further af@@ i@@ eld to better the human condi@@ tion . 
In@@ de@@ ed , over the p@@ ast 15 years we have s@@ par@@ ed no ef@@ for@@ t to ensure that Africa experi@@ ences her renew@@ al in what should in ac@@ tual practice be the African C@@ ent@@ ur@@ y . 
It is this , and this al@@ one , that has inform@@ ed our per@@ si@@ st@@ ence in assi@@ sting the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we to find a la@@ sting so@@ lution to the cri@@ sis in that country . 
We wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te all the parties in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we for conclu@@ ding neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , deliver@@ ing the ulti@@ mate pri@@ z@@ e that has al@@ ways been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ contin@@ ent as a who@@ le : that is , a st@@ able and leg@@ iti@@ mate government ge@@ ar@@ ed to address the chall@@ eng@@ es that the people fac@@ e . 
We are tr@@ uly he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed that , y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , the Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an Parliament passed A@@ mend@@ ment 19 of the Constitution , la@@ ying the basis for the inst@@ all@@ ation of an inclu@@ sive government . 
Special men@@ tion in this regard is due to SA@@ D@@ C facilit@@ ator , form@@ er President Th@@ ab@@ o Mbek@@ i and the te@@ am that ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly and pati@@ ently hel@@ p@@ ed to bring the process to a success@@ ful conclu@@ sion . 
In this respect , there is ur@@ g@@ ent need to assist in de@@ aling with the h@@ um@@ anit@@ ari@@ an cri@@ sis in that country . 
We are conf@@ ident that , because it car@@ es , the international community will part@@ ner the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we as they bla@@ z@@ e out al@@ ong a new tr@@ ail . 
We are also encour@@ aged that , wh@@ ate@@ ver f@@ its and star@@ ts may se@@ em to character@@ ise the progres@@ s of the people of the Demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c Republic of Con@@ go on their mar@@ ch to st@@ ability and pro@@ sper@@ ity , that progres@@ s is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able . 
The part@@ nership buil@@ t in the rec@@ ent period between the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the D@@ R@@ C and R@@ w@@ and@@ a hol@@ ds out a pro@@ mis@@ e for advan@@ ces in matters of security and in de@@ aling with the h@@ um@@ anit@@ ari@@ an cri@@ sis ; 
but , h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , also with regard to political di@@ al@@ og@@ ue . 
In the same meas@@ ure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Uni@@ on to pur@@ su@@ e these objec@@ tives in Bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , S@@ ud@@ an , Western S@@ a@@ har@@ a , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ i@@ re , S@@ om@@ ali@@ a and el@@ se@@ where . 
As would have been evid@@ enc@@ ed by various develop@@ ments in the p@@ ast few months , South Africa will use the pri@@ vi@@ lege of chair@@ ing SA@@ D@@ C to streng@@ then this cri@@ tical regional institution , with particular em@@ ph@@ asis on implementing S@@ um@@ mit resol@@ u@@ tions and ce@@ men@@ ting regional strategi@@ c co@@ h@@ esi@@ on . 
te vers@@ ter@@ k eerder as te vers@@ wa@@ k . 
We will as al@@ ways se@@ ek to streng@@ then coo@@ per@@ ation with these and other countries in p@@ urs@@ uit of that which is good for h@@ um@@ an@@ ity . 
We are pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged that this year we conclu@@ de c@@ ele@@ br@@ ations of the first dec@@ ade of our dipl@@ omati@@ c relations with the Pe@@ opl@@ es Republic of Ch@@ ina . 
O@@ ver these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mu@@ tual benefit to be g@@ ain@@ ed from our part@@ nership . 
We also wish to affir@@ m our commit@@ ment to the close relations that we have for@@ ged with B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and In@@ di@@ a through I@@ B@@ SA ; 
and in@@ de@@ ed to the streng@@ th@@ ening b@@ onds that our country has been for@@ ging with R@@ us@@ si@@ a , and countries in A@@ si@@ a , the Mid@@ d@@ le East , as well as L@@ ati@@ n and North A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a . 
We have on coun@@ t@@ less occ@@ asion@@ s ex@@ pres@@ sed our concer@@ n at the per@@ si@@ st@@ ence of conflic@@ t in the Mid@@ d@@ le East in general and in Is@@ ra@@ el and P@@ al@@ est@@ ine in particular . 
The dep@@ th of our dis@@ appointment at the rec@@ ent es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflic@@ t and m@@ assi@@ ve lo@@ ss of life , of especially civi@@ li@@ ans â including children , women and the el@@ der@@ ly â in@@ de@@ ed de@@ fi@@ es descri@@ ption . 
There can be no j@@ usti@@ fication for such acts of wan@@ ton des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion and sav@@ ag@@ er@@ y . 
And we do h@@ ope that this time ro@@ un@@ d , the renew@@ ed ef@@ for@@ ts of the international community to find a la@@ sting so@@ lution to this conflic@@ t will be@@ ar fr@@ uit , so Is@@ ra@@ eli@@ s and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ ans can en@@ jo@@ y pe@@ ace and security as n@@ eighbour@@ s within their s@@ over@@ ei@@ gn ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ies . 
O@@ ur special con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations to the government and people of C@@ ub@@ a on this the 50@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the at@@ tain@@ ment of their s@@ over@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty and , with it , the fre@@ edom to choo@@ se their p@@ ath of development . 
We were able in the p@@ ast year to conclu@@ de further neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on on our strategi@@ c part@@ nership ; 
and we do h@@ ope that the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t which inform@@ ed that eng@@ agement will prev@@ ail as we fin@@ ali@@ se the multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the Economic Par@@ t@@ nership Ag@@ ree@@ ments with countries in our reg@@ ion . 
We l@@ ook for@@ ward to further streng@@ th@@ ening this part@@ nership when we ho@@ st the South Afric@@ a-@@ E@@ U S@@ um@@ mit later this year . 
Al@@ ong with other countries of the South we will continue to pur@@ su@@ e the c@@ ause of the res@@ tr@@ uc@@ t@@ uring of the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations , the International Mon@@ et@@ ary Fund and other multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al institutions so they reflec@@ t the chan@@ ged and chan@@ ging glob@@ al re@@ ality and oper@@ ate in a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , eq@@ uitable and trans@@ parent manner . 
We also comm@@ it our@@ sel@@ ves to meet the objec@@ tives of international agreements , including the K@@ y@@ o@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l and its success@@ ors for the benefit of fu@@ ture gener@@ ations among our own people and pe@@ opl@@ es of the world . 
Inform@@ ing these our en@@ de@@ av@@ ours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mand@@ ate accor@@ ded this government in 2004 ; 
and the im@@ per@@ ative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elec@@ tions fin@@ ds a ready plat@@ form to imple@@ ment its programmes without un@@ due del@@ a@@ ys . 
In the com@@ ing few months pen@@ ding the national and provincial elec@@ tions , we will en@@ de@@ av@@ our to complete that pop@@ ula@@ r mand@@ ate . 
As part of the many det@@ ailed projects contain@@ ed in the govern@@ ments Programme of Ac@@ tion , we will pay particular atten@@ tion to : 
cre@@ ating the capacity necessary for impro@@ ved service delivery and better integr@@ ation within and ac@@ ross the spher@@ es of government , including national strategi@@ c planning ; 
continu@@ ing with the W@@ ar on P@@ over@@ ty c@@ ampaign and fin@@ alis@@ ing the dr@@ aft of the Com@@ prehensive An@@ ti@@ -@@ p@@ over@@ ty Strateg@@ y through the public consult@@ ations now under way ; 
implementing the com@@ prehensive programme we have put in place to eli@@ min@@ ate the incid@@ ence of ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a in various parts of the country ; 
continu@@ ing research and consult@@ ations on the Com@@ prehensive Social Security Sy@@ stem , including the matter of National Health In@@ sur@@ ance ; 
inten@@ si@@ f@@ ying the c@@ ampaign to sa@@ ve en@@ ergy , so as to manage the current diffic@@ ul@@ ties and change our own be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our , while at the same time spe@@ eding up the projects to build new capacity and u@@ ti@@ li@@ se altern@@ ative en@@ ergy s@@ our@@ ces â recogn@@ ising that in addi@@ tion to the con@@ sequ@@ ences of cli@@ mate change , resources such as fo@@ s@@ si@@ l fu@@ els and water are dec@@ lin@@ ing in the same meas@@ ure as de@@ m@@ and is increas@@ ing ; 
integr@@ ating into the work of the relevant C@@ l@@ us@@ ters the fin@@ dings of research on Sec@@ ond Economy inter@@ ven@@ tions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es and rural development initi@@ atives ; 
inten@@ si@@ f@@ ying ef@@ for@@ ts to re@@ v@@ amp the criminal justice system , including better for@@ ensi@@ c capacity , rap@@ id increase in the number of de@@ tec@@ tives , op@@ ti@@ mal u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of information and communic@@ ations technology , and better management of the courts ; 
and facilit@@ ating the processes aimed at streng@@ th@@ ening the mach@@ in@@ er@@ ies de@@ aling with matters of gen@@ der equ@@ ality such as 50@@ /@@ 50 represent@@ ation in deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making structures , youth development , the rights of people with dis@@ ability and childr@@ ens rights â including com@@ pl@@ eting consult@@ ations on the National Youth Policy , prepar@@ ing for the implementation of the African Youth Char@@ ter once it has been process@@ ed by Parliament , and for the s@@ etting up of the National Youth Development Agency ; 
and exten@@ ding the number of municipalities that have set up Childr@@ ens Rights F@@ o@@ cal Po@@ in@@ ts be@@ y@@ ond the current 60 . 
These and other programmes , including the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities identified in the State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ d@@ res@@ s last February , form the bed@@ ro@@ ck of our ef@@ for@@ ts to conclu@@ de the pop@@ ula@@ r mand@@ ate and la@@ y the f@@ oundation for the fu@@ ture . 
We will inten@@ si@@ fy our ef@@ for@@ ts in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m , the h@@ ope and the res@@ ili@@ ence of the South African people in p@@ urs@@ uit of that which is good for all of us . 
This , and this in the main , is the s@@ our@@ ce of our conf@@ id@@ ence when we sa@@ y that the n@@ ation is in a good state . 
It is ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly gro@@ wing str@@ on@@ ger . 
And so , in the word@@ s of form@@ er President M@@ and@@ ela , d@@ are not ling@@ er , for long w@@ alk is not y@@ et en@@ ded .

i am also ple@@ ased to wel@@ come to the hou@@ se the acti@@ vis@@ ts of the 19@@ 5@@ 6 wo@@ mens mar@@ ch and the 19@@ 76 so@@ wet@@ o up@@ ris@@ ing who are sitting in the presid@@ ents bo@@ x , as well as the em@@ in@@ ent pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts from all our provinces , pro@@ posed by our provincial spe@@ ak@@ ers to jo@@ in the group of important gu@@ ests who have jo@@ in@@ ed us to@@ day . 
the government of the people of south africa on who@@ se behalf i spe@@ ak here to@@ day , as i have been pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to do in previous years , was form@@ ed in 2004 , after the general elec@@ tions of that year . 
at its annual j@@ an@@ u@@ ary lek@@ go@@ t@@ l@@ a or bos@@ ber@@ aad last month , the national cabinet that stand@@ s at the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le of the system of govern@@ ance over which we are pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to pres@@ ide , reflec@@ ted on the f@@ act that its me@@ eting mark@@ ed the mid@@ -@@ term of the life of the government bor@@ n of our last , 2004 , elec@@ tions . 
having under@@ st@@ ood this , it was natural that we should put the ques@@ tion to our@@ sel@@ ves â what progres@@ s have we made in the qu@@ est to achi@@ eve the objec@@ tives to which we hon@@ est@@ ly to@@ ld the n@@ ation we were commit@@ ted , as a result of which our people ga@@ ve us the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming authority to g@@ over@@ n our country from 2004 until the next elec@@ tions in 2009 ! 
with your ind@@ ul@@ gen@@ ce , i would like to ste@@ p further back , and rec@@ all what we said , in 2004 , as represent@@ atives of our people , in the pres@@ ence of our f@@ ri@@ ends from the rest of the world , con@@ ven@@ ed at our se@@ at of government the uni@@ on buil@@ dings in ts@@ h@@ wan@@ e on fre@@ edom day , the 10@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of our li@@ ber@@ ation , and particip@@ ated in the in@@ a@@ ug@@ ur@@ ation of the president of the republic , whom our parliament had ch@@ os@@ en , respec@@ ting the will of the people demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ cally de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated during the 2004 elec@@ tions . 
on that occ@@ asi@@ on we said in part : 
for to@@ o long our country contain@@ ed within it and repres@@ ented much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety 
it was a place in which to be bor@@ n black was to in@@ her@@ it a lif@@ el@@ ong cur@@ se . 
it was a place in which to be bor@@ n wh@@ i@@ te was to car@@ ry a permanent bur@@ den of fe@@ ar and h@@ id@@ den r@@ age 
it was a place in which s@@ qu@@ al@@ or , the st@@ en@@ ch of p@@ over@@ ty , the open se@@ w@@ ers , the dec@@ a@@ ying ro@@ t , the mil@@ ling c@@ ro@@ w@@ ds of w@@ ret@@ ch@@ ed@@ ness , the un@@ ending im@@ ages of a land@@ s@@ cape stre@@ wn with car@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed ref@@ use , assum@@ ed an a@@ spec@@ t that se@@ em@@ ed necessary to en@@ h@@ ance the be@@ au@@ ty of another world of ti@@ dy stre@@ ets , and w@@ oo@@ ded lan@@ es , and f@@ low@@ ers blo@@ ss@@ oms off@@ s@@ etting the gre@@ en and sing@@ ing gr@@ as@@ s , and bir@@ ds and hou@@ ses fit for kings and qu@@ een@@ s , and ly@@ ric@@ al musi@@ c , and lo@@ ve . 
it was a place in which to live in some pla@@ ces was to in@@ vi@@ te oth@@ ers to pre@@ y on you or to con@@ de@@ m@@ n on@@ es@@ el@@ f to pre@@ y on oth@@ ers , guar@@ ante@@ ed n@@ eighbour@@ s who could not but f@@ all vic@@ ti@@ m to al@@ cohol and dr@@ ug stu@@ por@@ s that would d@@ ul@@ l the pa@@ in of living , who k@@ new that their li@@ ves would not be normal without m@@ ur@@ der in their mid@@ st , and rap@@ e and bru@@ tal personal war@@ s without a c@@ ause . 
it was a place in which to live in other n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds was to en@@ jo@@ y safety and security because to be safe was to be protec@@ ted by high w@@ al@@ ls , elec@@ tri@@ fied f@@ ences , gu@@ ard do@@ gs , police pat@@ ro@@ ls and mi@@ li@@ tary reg@@ i@@ ments ready to def@@ end those who were our mas@@ ters , with gun@@ s and tan@@ ks and air@@ craft that would ra@@ in death on those who would di@@ st@@ ur@@ b the pe@@ ace of the mas@@ ters 
we have ga@@ ther@@ ed here to@@ day , on fre@@ edom day , because in time , our people , together with the b@@ illi@@ ons of human be@@ ings ac@@ ross the glo@@ be , who are our com@@ rad@@ es@@ -@@ in-@@ arms and whom our di@@ st@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed gu@@ ests repres@@ ent , deci@@ ded to sa@@ y â an end to all that ! 
we are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged that our general elec@@ tions of a for@@ t@@ ni@@ ght ag@@ o confir@@ med the determin@@ ation of all our people , regar@@ d@@ less of r@@ ace , col@@ our and eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dre@@ am 
n@@ one of the gre@@ at social problems we have to sol@@ ve is capable of resolution outside the con@@ text of the cre@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of p@@ over@@ ty . 
the work to create that south africa has beg@@ un . 
that work will continue during our second dec@@ ade of fre@@ edom . 
fi@@ f@@ ty years before , as they prepar@@ ed to con@@ ven@@ e the con@@ gres@@ s of the people , which adopted the fre@@ edom char@@ ter , the pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts of the day had said , let us spe@@ ak together , all of us together â african and e@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an , indi@@ an and col@@ ou@@ red all the people of south africa let us spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom . 
and of the happ@@ in@@ ess that can come to m@@ en and women if they live in a land that is free . 
we must to@@ day r@@ ene@@ w our ple@@ dge , to spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom , to act in part@@ nership to re@@ ali@@ se the happ@@ in@@ ess for all that should come with li@@ ber@@ ty , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dre@@ am , to sa@@ y , together , in action â en@@ ough of ever@@ y@@ thing that made our country to cont@@ ain within it and repres@@ ent much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety ! 
we must continue to respon@@ d to the per@@ spec@@ tive we spo@@ ke of as the present government beg@@ an its term of office , fully cons@@ ci@@ ous that n@@ one of the gre@@ at social problems we have to sol@@ ve is capable of resolution outside the con@@ text of the cre@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of p@@ over@@ ty , and therefore that the str@@ ug@@ g@@ le to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate p@@ over@@ ty has been and will continue to be a c@@ entral part of the national ef@@ for@@ t to build the new south africa . 
respond@@ ing to the im@@ per@@ ative to mo@@ ve for@@ ward as qu@@ ick@@ ly as possible to build the south africa defined by a common dre@@ am , our government commit@@ ted it@@ self , working with all south afric@@ ans , to imple@@ ment det@@ ailed programmes inten@@ ded : 
to ra@@ ise the rate of inves@@ tment in the first econ@@ omy ; 
to imple@@ ment det@@ ailed programmes to respon@@ d to the chall@@ eng@@ es of the second econ@@ omy ; 
to acceler@@ ate the process of renew@@ al of the african contin@@ ent ; 
at an a@@ ver@@ age of over 4@@ ,@@ 5 , the rate of growth of our econ@@ omy over the p@@ ast two and hal@@ f years has been at its high@@ est sin@@ ce we at@@ tained our demo@@ cracy in 1994 . 
inves@@ tment in the econ@@ omy , by both the public and private sec@@ tors has been increas@@ ing at about 11 , with over@@ all public sector infrastructure sp@@ ending increas@@ ing by an annual a@@ ver@@ age of 15@@ ,@@ 8 . 
to@@ day , fix@@ ed inves@@ tment as a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of gro@@ ss domestic product â at about 18@@ ,@@ 4 â is at its high@@ est sin@@ ce 199@@ 1 . 
the number of employed people has been increas@@ ing at about hal@@ f@@ -@@ a-@@ million a year in the p@@ ast three years . 
we have se@@ en ste@@ ad@@ y progres@@ s in the advan@@ cement of black people in the econ@@ omy . 
from ow@@ ning j@@ ust over 3 of the market cap@@ it@@ alisation of the j@@ se in 2004 , this has increas@@ ed to close on to 5 ; 
and the propor@@ tion of bla@@ c@@ ks in to@@ p management has gro@@ wn from 24 of the total to 27 . 
y@@ et we must remain concerned that these fi@@ g@@ ures are still w@@ oef@@ ul@@ ly low . 
the advan@@ ces in the econ@@ omy have th@@ ro@@ wn up maj@@ or chall@@ eng@@ es for all of us . 
the m@@ assi@@ ve and sustain@@ ed increase in consum@@ er de@@ m@@ and reflec@@ ts a health@@ y growth in levels of pro@@ sper@@ ity ac@@ ross the pop@@ ulation ; 
but our international trade bal@@ ance sho@@ ws that we have not succ@@ ee@@ ded in building the capacity to produce the consum@@ er and capital goods that our country needs . 
while hou@@ se@@ hold deb@@ t has increas@@ ed bro@@ ad@@ ly at the same rate as growth in income , the f@@ act that south afric@@ ans are sav@@ ing less means that we have to dep@@ end on sav@@ ings from other n@@ ations . 
the continu@@ ing occ@@ asion@@ al vol@@ ati@@ lity of our curr@@ ency has also not bo@@ ded well for our export industr@@ ies . 
over the p@@ ast three years , the econ@@ omy has cre@@ ated some on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f million j@@ ob@@ s . 
it is encour@@ aging that in the year mar@@ ch 2005 to mar@@ ch 2006 al@@ one , 300 000 of the j@@ ob@@ s cre@@ ated were in the form@@ al sector outside of agric@@ ulture , repres@@ enting a growth rate of about 4 . 
a small part of these are the permanent job opportunities cre@@ ated through the exp@@ an@@ ded public works programme . 
but there is no ques@@ tion that this programme can and must be r@@ at@@ ch@@ e@@ ted up@@ wards qui@@ te sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly . 
there is also no ques@@ tion that we can do much better to create self@@ -@@ employment through small and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es . 
and given that a lar@@ ge majority of the un@@ employed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such inter@@ ven@@ tions as the national youth service and the development of young entrepreneurs . 
it is a matter of pri@@ de that , in line with our commit@@ ment to build a car@@ ing soci@@ ety , we have sin@@ ce 2004 impro@@ ved service provision and other a@@ spec@@ ts of the social w@@ age . 
while benef@@ ici@@ aries of social gr@@ ants num@@ ber@@ ed about 8 million in 2004 , to@@ day 11 million poor south afric@@ ans have access to these gr@@ ants . 
it is encour@@ aging that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the rec@@ ent period , been within man@@ age@@ able ran@@ ges , as the programmes re@@ ach mat@@ urity . 
this will ensure sustain@@ ability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more j@@ ob@@ s and business opportunities . 
the housing programme has se@@ en close to 300 000 new subsi@@ dies allocated in the p@@ ast two years . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , as we s@@ ou@@ ght to improve quality and develop plan@@ s for those who are being mis@@ sed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the p@@ ace of ro@@ ll@@ -@@ out has been much s@@ low@@ er than we exp@@ ected . 
we must act to change this situ@@ ation . 
as hon@@ our@@ able members are aw@@ are , we have over the p@@ ast few years developed and star@@ ted implementing various programmes aimed at impro@@ ving p@@ assen@@ ger transport . 
these include the tax@@ i rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation programme and provincial initi@@ atives such as the mo@@ lo@@ to r@@ ail cor@@ rid@@ or in mp@@ um@@ al@@ anga around which fe@@ asi@@ bility work has star@@ ted , the kli@@ p@@ fontein cor@@ rid@@ or in cape town and the g@@ au@@ tra@@ in project with its lin@@ k@@ ages to the rest of the public transport system . 
these and many other initi@@ atives form part of a com@@ prehensive p@@ assen@@ ger transport strategy , com@@ bin@@ ing both road and r@@ ail . 
we will atten@@ d to the ur@@ g@@ ent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
access to elec@@ tricity , water and sanit@@ ation has impro@@ ved . 
by 2005 , south africa had already achiev@@ ed the m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um development go@@ al in respect of basic water supp@@ ly , with impro@@ vement of access from 59 in 1994 to 8@@ 3 in 2006 . 
according to the uni@@ ted n@@ ations development programme , south africa is one of the few countries that sp@@ end less on mi@@ li@@ tary bud@@ gets than on water and sanit@@ ation . 
in the word@@ s of the un@@ d@@ p human development report of 2006 : 
south africa has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanis@@ m for em@@ powerment and a guide to policy righ@@ ts@@ -@@ based water re@@ form has en@@ abled it to exp@@ and access and over@@ come the leg@@ acy of ra@@ cial in@@ equ@@ ality in@@ her@@ i@@ ted from ap@@ ar@@ theid , part@@ ly through righ@@ ts@@ -@@ based entit@@ le@@ ments . 
we should in@@ de@@ ed c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate this gre@@ at achiev@@ e@@ ment . 
but it is a f@@ act that 8 million people are still without po@@ table water . 
many more are without elec@@ tricity and sanit@@ ation . 
we are pro@@ u@@ d that within one year , we have been able to re@@ duce the bac@@ k@@ lo@@ g in the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of the b@@ uc@@ k@@ et system in established sett@@ le@@ ments by al@@ most hal@@ f . 
we are on course to put an end to this de@@ h@@ um@@ anis@@ ing system in these areas by the end of this year . 
we will continue to conf@@ ron@@ t these chall@@ eng@@ es so as to er@@ ase in our country that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive so that together we can spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom and the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with li@@ ber@@ ty . 
an examin@@ ation of education and skills ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion sho@@ ws impro@@ vement of qui@@ te a high b@@ ase by 2004 , th@@ ough at a s@@ low p@@ ace . 
this applies to liter@@ acy levels , gro@@ ss school en@@ rol@@ ment and tertiary participation rates . 
the flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating ma@@ tric pas@@ s rates do indic@@ ate that much more needs to be done to st@@ abili@@ se the system and ensure ste@@ ad@@ y impro@@ vement . 
at the same time , the number of ma@@ tric stud@@ ents who pas@@ s ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs at the higher gr@@ ade is only s@@ ligh@@ tly better than in 1995 . 
we also continue to s@@ how we@@ ak@@ nesses in implementing the ad@@ ult basic education programme . 
while the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion programme has resul@@ ted in more sett@@ le@@ ments in the rec@@ ent period , we still need to put in ex@@ tr@@ a ef@@ for@@ t in de@@ aling with remain@@ ing cases , many of which are much more comple@@ x . 
on the other hand , very li@@ tt@@ le progres@@ s has been made in terms of land re@@ distribu@@ tion . 
we will under@@ take a car@@ ef@@ ul review of the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ing fac@@ tors so that this programme is ur@@ gen@@ tly spe@@ e@@ ded up . 
all these economic and social programmes form part of our strateg@@ ies to re@@ duce and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the p@@ over@@ ty that continu@@ es to aff@@ lic@@ t many of our people . 
the work done during the course of last year , by women through the south african women in di@@ al@@ og@@ ue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as t@@ un@@ isi@@ a and ch@@ ile where gre@@ at progres@@ s has been made in de@@ aling with p@@ over@@ ty , does poin@@ t to some def@@ ec@@ ts in our systems in this regard . 
from the experi@@ ence of this deleg@@ ation it is c@@ le@@ ar that we must among other th@@ ings : 
defin@@ e clear@@ ly the p@@ over@@ ty ma@@ tri@@ x of our country ; 
develop a pro@@ per database of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds living in p@@ over@@ ty ; 
identi@@ fy and imple@@ ment specific inter@@ ven@@ tions relevant to these hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ; 
monitor progres@@ s in these hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds as the programmes take effect in gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ating them out of p@@ over@@ ty ; 
in this con@@ text , address all indigen@@ ce , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
co-ordin@@ ate and a@@ lig@@ n all anti@@ -@@ p@@ over@@ ty programmes to maxim@@ ise impact and a@@ vo@@ id wa@@ st@@ age and du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation ; 
acceler@@ ate the training of family social workers at professional and au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary levels to ensure that identified hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds are proper@@ ly sup@@ ported and monit@@ or@@ ed . 
this will ensure the syste@@ mati@@ c lin@@ k@@ age of benef@@ ici@@ aries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continu@@ ously foc@@ used on the t@@ ask to ensure that as many of our people as possible gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate out of depend@@ ence on social gr@@ ants and enter the labour market . 
in the me@@ an@@ time , we will continue to ex@@ pl@@ ore new initi@@ atives which will progres@@ si@@ vely improve the social w@@ age . 
a cri@@ tical leg of these social inter@@ ven@@ tions should be the inten@@ si@@ fication of jo@@ int ef@@ for@@ ts among all south afric@@ ans to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on . 
in this year of the 60@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the doc@@ tors p@@ act of lea@@ ders of african and indi@@ an communities , the 30@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the m@@ ur@@ der of ste@@ ve b@@ ik@@ o and the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the visit to d@@ ak@@ ar by afrik@@ an@@ er intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als to meet the an@@ c , the issue of our variety of identi@@ ties and the over@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing s@@ ense of bel@@ on@@ ging to south africa needs to be better can@@ v@@ ass@@ ed ac@@ ross soci@@ ety , in a manner that streng@@ th@@ ens our un@@ ity as a n@@ ation . 
further , on this the 30@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the ban@@ ning of the world and the week@@ end world new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , we are du@@ ty@@ -@@ b@@ ound to ask the ques@@ tion - have we all fully inter@@ na@@ lis@@ ed our responsibility in building social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and promo@@ ting a common s@@ ense of bel@@ on@@ ging , re@@ in@@ for@@ cing the g@@ lu@@ e that hol@@ ds our n@@ ation together ! 
in other word@@ s , measures required to improve social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on cannot be under@@ taken by government al@@ one . 
we must together as south afric@@ ans spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom from want and from mor@@ al dec@@ ay , and work to at@@ tain the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with it . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person ; 
i am certain that we shall all ag@@ ree that working together to achi@@ eve the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with fre@@ edom applies equ@@ ally to the chall@@ en@@ ge of de@@ aling with crime . 
in the 1994 r@@ d@@ p wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er we said : 
promo@@ ting pe@@ ace and security will invol@@ ve all people . 
it will build on and exp@@ and the national dri@@ ve for pe@@ ace and com@@ b@@ at the en@@ de@@ mi@@ c viol@@ ence fac@@ ed by communities with special atten@@ tion to the various forms of viol@@ ence to which women are sub@@ jec@@ ted 
pe@@ ace and political st@@ ability are also c@@ entral to the govern@@ ments ef@@ for@@ ts to create an en@@ ab@@ ling environment to encour@@ age inves@@ tment deci@@ sive action will be taken to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate law@@ l@@ ess@@ ness , dr@@ ug tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ king , g@@ un r@@ un@@ ning , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
cer@@ tain@@ ly , we cannot er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive and claim the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with fre@@ edom if communities live in fe@@ ar , clo@@ se@@ ted be@@ hin@@ d w@@ al@@ ls and bar@@ bed wi@@ re , ever an@@ x@@ ious in their hou@@ ses , on the stre@@ ets and on our roads , unable fre@@ ely to en@@ jo@@ y our public sp@@ ac@@ es . 
ob@@ vi@@ ously , we must continue and further inten@@ si@@ fy the str@@ ug@@ g@@ le against crime . 
while we have already sur@@ passed that tar@@ ge@@ ted fi@@ g@@ ure of 15@@ 2 000 police officers employed in the south african police service , and while we have impro@@ ved the training programme , we recogn@@ ise the f@@ act that the impact of this is not y@@ et high en@@ ough for ever@@ y@@ body to fe@@ el a better s@@ ense of safety and security . 
while we have re@@ duced the incid@@ ence of most contact cri@@ mes , the annual re@@ duction rate with regard to such categories as ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y , ass@@ a@@ ult and m@@ ur@@ der is still below the 7-@@ 10 that we had tar@@ ge@@ ted . 
and the abuse of women and children continu@@ es at an un@@ accep@@ table level . 
the increase in the incid@@ ence of particular cri@@ mes during the security workers str@@ i@@ ke should have b@@ rou@@ ght home to all of us the f@@ act that the security industry cannot be hand@@ led si@@ mp@@ ly as a private aff@@ air of the private sector . 
qui@@ te clear@@ ly the regula@@ tory system that we have in place is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate . 
this applies to such issues as w@@ age levels , person@@ nel v@@ etting systems , en@@ for@@ cement of guidel@@ ines on cas@@ h@@ -@@ delivery vehicles , and so on . 
this is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addi@@ tion to impro@@ ving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the public , in which hu@@ ge resources are exp@@ en@@ ded , are ac@@ tu@@ ally met . 
we will also continue to put more ef@@ for@@ t into impro@@ ving the func@@ tion@@ ing of our courts , to increase the rate of re@@ duction in case bac@@ k@@ log@@ s . 
and we will ensure that deci@@ sions to exp@@ and the cor@@ rectional services infrastructure , improve the management of bor@@ der control as well as the im@@ migr@@ ation and docu@@ mentation services , among oth@@ ers , are implemen@@ ted . 
many of the we@@ ak@@ nesses in impro@@ ving services to the pop@@ ulation deri@@ ve in part from in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
as such , in the period le@@ ading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our ag@@ end@@ a . 
what has emer@@ ged , among oth@@ ers , as a cri@@ tical area for strategi@@ c intervention is the content of training that public serv@@ ants receive in various institutions and the role of the sa management development institu@@ te which in ac@@ tual f@@ act should be the maj@@ or service provi@@ der including in the mass in@@ duction of public serv@@ ants . 
compli@@ ance levels within departments , in rel@@ ation to public service and fin@@ ance management legislation , have been some@@ what mix@@ ed . 
ob@@ vi@@ ously this cannot be allow@@ ed to continue , even if we take into account the correc@@ t ob@@ serv@@ ation that audi@@ ting requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent . 
in this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particul@@ arly for senior management is cr@@ u@@ cial . 
programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue ap@@ ace . 
immedi@@ ately after the mar@@ ch 2006 local government elec@@ tions , in@@ duction programmes were conduc@@ ted , taking into account that 62 of the may@@ ors are new . 
what is of concer@@ n , th@@ ough , is that in many of these municipalities , many vac@@ an@@ cies remain or have emer@@ ged in senior management and the profes@@ sions . 
the programme to a@@ lig@@ n planning instru@@ ments ac@@ ross the spher@@ es of government is continu@@ ing , with pil@@ ot projects for complete a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment being r@@ un in 13 of our distr@@ ic@@ ts and metro@@ s . 
these pil@@ ot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
it is a matter of pro@@ u@@ d record that over hal@@ f of the distr@@ ic@@ ts and metro@@ s have held their growth and development sum@@ mits , and the rest inten@@ d to complete this process by the end of fe@@ bru@@ ary . 
this will la@@ y the basis for coo@@ per@@ ation among all social part@@ ners in spe@@ eding up local economic development . 
i would like to take advan@@ t@@ age of this occ@@ asi@@ on to ex@@ pres@@ s my gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de to deputy president ph@@ um@@ z@@ ile m@@ lam@@ bo@@ -@@ n@@ g@@ cu@@ ka for the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing lea@@ ders@@ hip she has given to the implementation of the acceler@@ ated and shar@@ ed growth initi@@ ative , working with the ministers and pre@@ mi@@ ers who constitu@@ te the t@@ ask te@@ am , con@@ cre@@ te@@ ly addres@@ sing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of inves@@ tment and la@@ bour@@ -@@ ab@@ s@@ or@@ ption , as well as matters per@@ taining to skills development and the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the state system . 
we high@@ ly app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the contribu@@ tion of all members of the executive and our public service man@@ ag@@ ers , ac@@ ross the three spher@@ es of government , in le@@ ading this process and in implementing the government programme as a who@@ le . 
this is c@@ entral to our ef@@ for@@ ts to er@@ ase that which is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in our soci@@ ety so that we can spe@@ ak of fre@@ edom and the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with li@@ ber@@ ty . 
in this regard , in order further to spe@@ ed up the implementation of as@@ g@@ is@@ a , over and above the multi@@ -@@ year programmes ann@@ oun@@ ced in the rec@@ ent p@@ ast , government will this year : 
complete the process of re@@ view@@ ing the countr@@ ys experi@@ ence in the arti@@ cul@@ ation among such m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic indic@@ ators as the ex@@ change rate , inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industr@@ ies which produce tr@@ ad@@ ab@@ les for both the domestic and export mark@@ ets , and have the potential to ab@@ s@@ or@@ b lar@@ ge p@@ ools of sem@@ i@@ -@@ sk@@ il@@ led workers ; 
in line with the national indus@@ trial policy framework which has now been completed , we will : 
inten@@ si@@ fy implementation of custom@@ ised sector measures to facilitate inv@@ est@@ ments in business process ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing , tourism , bio@@ -@@ fu@@ els and chemicals , and fin@@ ali@@ se practi@@ cal programmes for for@@ es@@ try and pap@@ er , clo@@ thing and tex@@ ti@@ les , met@@ als and eng@@ ine@@ ering ; 
this must include a determined dri@@ ve to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
with regard to min@@ er@@ al benef@@ ici@@ ation for in@@ stance , we will set up a state di@@ am@@ ond tr@@ ader that will pur@@ ch@@ ase 10 of di@@ am@@ onds from local produc@@ ers and sel@@ l them to local cu@@ t@@ ters and produc@@ ers . 
we are happ@@ y that de@@ be@@ ers has agre@@ ed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and ass@@ et provision for a period of three years ; 
with regard to communic@@ ations , i am ple@@ ased to ann@@ oun@@ ce that the department of communic@@ ations together with the mo@@ bi@@ le telephone compan@@ ies and tel@@ kom are fin@@ alis@@ ing plan@@ s to address call termin@@ ation rates this year for the benefit of all consum@@ ers . 
in addi@@ tion , tel@@ kom will apply a special low rate for international b@@ and@@ wid@@ th to 10 development call centres each employ@@ ing 1@@ 000 persons , as part of the ef@@ for@@ t to exp@@ and the b@@ p@@ o sector . 
these centres will be established in areas identified by government . 
the special rate will be directly com@@ par@@ able to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the com@@ par@@ able countries . 
we will also take a variety of ste@@ ps to improve competi@@ tion in the econ@@ omy , among oth@@ ers to low@@ er the cost of do@@ ing business and promote inves@@ tment , including practi@@ cal intro@@ duction of the regula@@ tory impact assessment system , developing high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed national and international bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and capacity , fin@@ alis@@ ing the plan to improve the capacity of the r@@ ail and port oper@@ ators , and streng@@ th@@ ening the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of our competi@@ tion author@@ ities . 
the progres@@ s we have made with regard to the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of further education and training col@@ leg@@ es has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibi@@ lity for us sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly to exp@@ and the number of available arti@@ s@@ ans . 
star@@ ting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to train@@ ees in need , who enter these institutions . 
at the same time , we shall ur@@ gen@@ tly resol@@ ve the issue of responsibi@@ lities between the national and provincial spher@@ es in the management of the f@@ et system . 
we do h@@ ope that our ef@@ for@@ ts to promote this area of opportun@@ ity will help send the m@@ ess@@ age especially to our young people , that arti@@ s@@ an skills are as cri@@ tical for economic growth as other levels of quali@@ fication . 
after inten@@ se inter@@ action between government and lea@@ ders of our uni@@ versi@@ ties , agreement has been re@@ ached and deci@@ sions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in sh@@ ort supp@@ ly are provided . 
in this regard , we wish to com@@ men@@ d the role pla@@ y@@ ed by the jo@@ int initi@@ ative on skills ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , which br@@ ings together government , business , labour , training institu@@ tes and oth@@ ers . 
as the hon@@ our@@ able members know , we have also sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly increas@@ ed the number of non-@@ fee pay@@ ing schools . 
in car@@ ry@@ ing out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be inform@@ ed by our commit@@ ment to ensure that the 2010 fi@@ f@@ a world cu@@ p is the best ever . 
we wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te our local organis@@ ing committee and other part@@ ners for the ster@@ ling work they are do@@ ing . 
qui@@ te clear@@ ly , in order to ensure that all south afric@@ ans en@@ jo@@ y the happ@@ in@@ ess that comes with a gro@@ wing econ@@ omy , these and other measures will need to be ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by an inten@@ si@@ fied programme to address chall@@ eng@@ es in the second econ@@ omy . 
because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other th@@ ings : 
take further practi@@ cal action to improve access to micro@@ -@@ fin@@ ance including the re@@ ach of the ap@@ e@@ x fund and the agricultural micro@@ -@@ cre@@ dit fund ; 
ensure the pro@@ per func@@ tion@@ ing of the small enterpris@@ es development ag@@ ency , s@@ ed@@ a ; 
process the compan@@ ies bill , adopted for public com@@ ment by cabinet last w@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , as part of the bat@@ ter@@ y of measures to re@@ duce the regula@@ tory bur@@ den on small , medi@@ um and micro@@ -@@ enterpris@@ es and to em@@ power min@@ ority sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders and employees ; 
having sur@@ passed the 10 000 tar@@ get we set our@@ sel@@ ves , we will increase the number of young people eng@@ aged in the national youth service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plan@@ s in this regard , en@@ rol 30 000 young volun@@ te@@ ers in community development initi@@ atives , and em@@ plo@@ y 5 000 young people as part of the exp@@ an@@ ded public works programme in the maintenance of government buil@@ dings ; 
start implementing the commun@@ al land rights act in order to improve economic u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of commun@@ al land , while at the same time exp@@ and@@ ing assistance such as ir@@ rig@@ ation , se@@ eds and imple@@ ments to small and coo@@ per@@ ative f@@ arm@@ ers . 
hon@@ our@@ able members ; 
the economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted dri@@ ve in which all of south africa should eng@@ age in order to re@@ duce the levels of p@@ over@@ ty and in@@ equ@@ ality in our soci@@ ety . 
for us it is not a m@@ ere cli@@ ch@@ Ã© to ass@@ er@@ t that the succ@@ ess of our demo@@ cracy should and will be meas@@ ured by the con@@ cre@@ te ste@@ ps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vul@@ ner@@ able in our soci@@ ety . 
a cri@@ tical part of this re@@ form will be the t@@ ask of re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing a def@@ ec@@ t identified in the 2002 report of the committee of in@@ qui@@ ry into a com@@ prehensive system of social security in south africa . 
this is that the contribu@@ tory ear@@ n@@ ings@@ -@@ related pil@@ lar of our social security system is mis@@ sing or un@@ re@@ li@@ able for lar@@ ge numbers of working people . 
the prin@@ cip@@ le g@@ ui@@ ding this appro@@ ach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government bud@@ get , we need to ex@@ pl@@ ore the intro@@ duction of an ear@@ n@@ ings@@ -@@ related contribu@@ tory social security system that is inform@@ ed by the prin@@ cip@@ le of social soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity . 
this will me@@ an that all south afric@@ ans will en@@ jo@@ y memb@@ ership of a common , administr@@ ati@@ vely efficient social ins@@ ur@@ ance system , while those ear@@ ning higher in@@ comes will be able to continue contribu@@ ting to private re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment and ins@@ ur@@ ance schem@@ es . 
in the disc@@ us@@ sions th@@ us f@@ ar conduc@@ ted within government , cons@@ ens@@ us is emer@@ ging that ele@@ ments of this system would need to include : 
the minister of fin@@ ance will further el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on these issues in the bud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h . 
what we should under@@ line th@@ ough is that in fin@@ is@@ hing the new social security disp@@ ensation , government will under@@ take a com@@ prehensive process of consult@@ ation with all social part@@ ners both individu@@ ally and through n@@ ed@@ la@@ c . 
in addi@@ tion , we have also star@@ ted exam@@ ining measures to re@@ ach vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 years . 
our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
geen po@@ gings om die openbare or@@ de ter wil@@ le van self@@ su@@ g@@ tige ei@@ e@@ belang om@@ ver te wer@@ p , sal ged@@ ul@@ d word nie . 
continu@@ ing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural ca@@ uses of death in our soci@@ ety as well as li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le diseases , mal@@ ari@@ a , the various str@@ ain@@ s of t@@ b , road accid@@ ents and viol@@ ent crime . 
in this regard , government comm@@ its it@@ self to inten@@ si@@ fy the c@@ ampaign against hi@@ v and a@@ ids and to improve its implementation of all ele@@ ments of the com@@ prehensive appro@@ ach such as pre@@ vention , hom@@ e-@@ based care and treatment . 
we shall ensure that the part@@ nershi@@ ps buil@@ t over the years are streng@@ th@@ ened , and that our impro@@ ved national com@@ prehensive strategy against a@@ ids and s@@ exually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions is fin@@ alised as soon as possible . 
this year we shall complete con@@ cre@@ te plan@@ s on implementation of the fin@@ al st@@ ages of our programmes to meet the tar@@ gets for uni@@ ver@@ sal access to water in 2008 , sanit@@ ation in 2010 and elec@@ tricity in 2@@ 012 . 
all these ef@@ for@@ ts , m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person , must go hand in hand with a sustain@@ ed dri@@ ve to improve community safety and security . 
in this regard , government will ensure that the deci@@ sions already taken about streng@@ th@@ ening our fi@@ ght against crime are effecti@@ vely implemen@@ ted . 
the chall@@ en@@ ge that we fac@@ e in addres@@ sing this issue has li@@ tt@@ le to do with policies . 
ra@@ ther , what is required is effective organisation , mo@@ bi@@ lis@@ ation and lea@@ ders@@ hip of the mass of law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement , intelligen@@ ce and correc@@ tions officers , and func@@ tion@@ aries of the justice system . 
the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of these public serv@@ ants have pro@@ ven over and over ag@@ ain in ac@@ tual practice that they are prepar@@ ed to put their li@@ ves on the line and to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ e even the li@@ tt@@ le quality time they could have with their fam@@ i@@ lies , in defence of our fre@@ edom and our security . 
in addi@@ tion to the many on@@ going programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : 
bring the oper@@ ations of the department of home af@@ fairs to full capacity , by fil@@ ling vac@@ ant po@@ sts , impro@@ ving systems and implementing other recommend@@ ations of the t@@ ask te@@ am that has been working with the minister to improve the work of this v@@ ital institution ; 
imple@@ ment the recommend@@ ations of the k@@ h@@ am@@ pe@@ pe commission on the mand@@ ate and oper@@ ations of the director@@ ate of special oper@@ ations ; 
imple@@ ment the programmes deci@@ ded up@@ on to build more correc@@ tions facilities and re@@ ali@@ se the objec@@ tives of the wh@@ i@@ te pap@@ er on correc@@ tions ; 
continue with the processes further to capac@@ it@@ ate our intelligen@@ ce ag@@ en@@ cies , and ensure that at all times they oper@@ ate within the framework of our constitution and laws ; 
in this regard , we must respon@@ d to the col@@ d re@@ ality that , as in other countries , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of viol@@ ent cri@@ mes against the person occ@@ ur in the most soci@@ o-@@ econom@@ ically dep@@ riv@@ ed areas of our country and require str@@ ong and sustain@@ ed community inter@@ ven@@ tions foc@@ used on crime pre@@ vention . 
as we have already said , these and other measures will succ@@ eed only if we build an end@@ uring part@@ nership in ac@@ tual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more diffic@@ ult for the crimin@@ als . 
in this regard , we are he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed by the resol@@ ve sho@@ wn by lea@@ ders of the business and relig@@ ious communities further to streng@@ then such part@@ nershi@@ ps on the groun@@ d , and to give of their time and resources to streng@@ then the fi@@ ght against crime . 
government will pla@@ y its part to ensure that these part@@ nershi@@ ps ac@@ tu@@ ally work , and that we all act together to dis@@ charge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
i should men@@ tion in this regard that the min@@ istry of safety and security and the police service are working on pro@@ pos@@ als further to improve the func@@ tion@@ ing and effecti@@ ven@@ ess of the v@@ it@@ ally important community police for@@ ums . 
further to improve its service to the people , government should op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e its capacity and organis@@ ational eff@@ ici@@ ency . 
to achi@@ eve these objec@@ tives , we will during the course of this year : 
conduct capacity assess@@ ments and imple@@ ment inter@@ ven@@ tions in provincial departments responsible for local government , as well as the offic@@ es of the pre@@ mi@@ ers , while continu@@ ing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
ro@@ ll out the b@@ ath@@ o p@@ ele c@@ ampaign at local government level , inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach activities including iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and set up more multi@@ purpose community centres be@@ y@@ ond the 90 currently operational ; 
impro@@ ving govern@@ ance also means having a s@@ ound statisti@@ cal database about social d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics within our n@@ ation . 
in this regard , two maj@@ or sur@@ ve@@ ys will be under@@ taken in 2007 . 
as of two days ag@@ o 6 000 field workers from statisti@@ cs south africa have g@@ one out ac@@ ross our country to collec@@ t information on 2@@ 80 000 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ch@@ os@@ en to participate in a community sur@@ ve@@ y , which will give government as accur@@ ate as possible a s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of the circum@@ stan@@ ces of citizens in every part of the country . 
in o@@ c@@ tober another 30 000 individu@@ als in 8 000 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds will be sel@@ ected to participate in south afric@@ as first national pan@@ el stud@@ y , the national income d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics stud@@ y . 
these 30 000 individu@@ als will be trac@@ ked over time , to further our under@@ standing of such issues such as migr@@ ation , labour market tran@@ si@@ tions , inter@@ -gener@@ ational mo@@ bility and hou@@ se@@ hold formation and dis@@ so@@ lution . 
i wish to take this opportun@@ ity to call on all those sel@@ ected to coo@@ per@@ ate fully in these important under@@ tak@@ ings . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person : 
among the gre@@ at@@ est achiev@@ e@@ ments of the pe@@ opl@@ es of africa in the p@@ ast tw@@ o-@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f years has been the res@@ tor@@ ation of pe@@ ace in the gre@@ at la@@ k@@ es reg@@ ion . 
we are pro@@ u@@ d , as south afric@@ ans , of the role that our people have pla@@ y@@ ed in hel@@ ping to bring this about â from the young m@@ en and women in our national defence force to employees of public and private institutions who ga@@ ve of their time to ensure that the african dre@@ am fin@@ ds practi@@ cal re@@ alisation in the hom@@ el@@ and of pa@@ tric@@ e l@@ um@@ um@@ b@@ a . 
we will continue to work with the si@@ ster people of the dr@@ c , as well as bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , the com@@ or@@ os and su@@ dan in particular to ensure that the condi@@ tion of pe@@ ace and st@@ ability th@@ us f@@ ar at@@ tained trans@@ la@@ tes without pa@@ use into concer@@ ted action for economic re@@ con@@ struction and social development . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , while we are fully j@@ usti@@ fied in c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating the achiev@@ e@@ ments that africa has made in her en@@ de@@ av@@ our to achi@@ eve pe@@ ace and development , we cannot under@@ pla@@ y the chall@@ eng@@ es that we fac@@ e in de@@ aling with the remain@@ ing areas of conflic@@ t , particul@@ arly the general pe@@ ace process in su@@ dan , including the situ@@ ation in d@@ ar@@ f@@ ur , c@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te di@@ vo@@ i@@ re and s@@ om@@ ali@@ a . 
our government will respon@@ d appropri@@ ately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the african uni@@ on for assistance to the people and government of s@@ om@@ ali@@ a . 
cri@@ tical in this regard , are the initi@@ atives under way to ensure that the pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ is@@ ts within s@@ om@@ ali@@ a inter@@ act with one another to find a so@@ lution that is inclu@@ sive and practi@@ c@@ able , based on the need to achi@@ eve national re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation . 
this year the african pe@@ er review forum will complete its review of our country . 
i wish to take this opportun@@ ity to th@@ ank our legisla@@ tors , government ministers and departments , our civil soci@@ ety organisations and soci@@ ety at lar@@ ge for the contribu@@ tion they made to an exercise that was as chall@@ en@@ ging as it was uni@@ qu@@ e for our young demo@@ cracy . 
we will also take the necessary ste@@ ps to imple@@ ment the required programme of action that will emer@@ ge as a result of the pe@@ er review process . 
si@@ mil@@ arly , we will continue to work with the rest of our contin@@ ent and our development part@@ ners to spe@@ ed up the implementation of the ne@@ pa@@ d programmes . 
j@@ ust over a month ag@@ o , south africa star@@ ted its t@@ our of du@@ ty as a non-@@ permanent member of the uni@@ ted n@@ ations security council . 
we her@@ e@@ by wish to ple@@ dge , on behalf of the people of south africa , that we will , in this most es@@ te@@ em@@ ed of multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al bo@@ dies , do ever@@ y@@ thing necessary further to contribu@@ te to international pe@@ ace and security . 
in this regard we will also continue to eng@@ age the lea@@ ders of the pe@@ opl@@ es of p@@ al@@ est@@ ine , is@@ ra@@ el , i@@ ra@@ q , ir@@ an and other countries in the mid@@ d@@ le e@@ ast and the per@@ si@@ an g@@ ul@@ f . 
we shall also continue to streng@@ then our relations with other countries on the contin@@ ent , our part@@ ners in indi@@ a , br@@ az@@ il and the pe@@ opl@@ es republic of ch@@ ina , other countries of the south , as well as j@@ ap@@ an , e@@ u@@ ro@@ pe and nor@@ th am@@ er@@ ic@@ a . 
one of the cri@@ tical ques@@ tions that we shall pur@@ su@@ e in this regard is the spe@@ ed@@ y res@@ um@@ ption of the do@@ ha development ro@@ un@@ d of w@@ to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations . 
we are con@@ vin@@ ced that so@@ lu@@ tions to the log@@ j@@ ams currently being experi@@ enc@@ ed can be found , and that it is in the l@@ ong@@ -@@ term interest of developed and developing countries a@@ like that these t@@ al@@ ks should re@@ ach fr@@ ui@@ tion . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker , chair@@ person and hon@@ our@@ able members ; 
sin@@ ce the pop@@ ula@@ r mand@@ ate of 2004 , we have made wel@@ come progres@@ s in further chan@@ ging south africa for the better . 
we should not and do not under@@ pla@@ y the many diffic@@ ul@@ ties we still conf@@ ron@@ t . 
but the m@@ ess@@ age that our collec@@ tive experi@@ ence communic@@ ates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succ@@ eed in me@@ eting the common objec@@ tive we have set our@@ sel@@ ves as a n@@ ation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and repres@@ ent much that is ug@@ ly and re@@ p@@ ul@@ sive in human soci@@ ety . 
we should to@@ day , even more conf@@ id@@ ently , spe@@ ak together of fre@@ edom . 
we should d@@ are to act in concer@@ t to pur@@ su@@ e the happ@@ in@@ ess that can come to m@@ en and women if they live in a land that is free . 
we are not there y@@ et . 
but no one , except our@@ sel@@ ves , shall ensure that this dre@@ am is re@@ alised . 
and so , let us ro@@ ll up our s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and get down to work , fully under@@ standing that the t@@ ask to build the south africa for which we year@@ n is a common responsibility we all share . 
th@@ ank you . 
issued by : the presid@@ ency fe@@ bru@@ ary 2007  
state of the n@@ ation address of the president of south africa , th@@ ab@@ o m@@ bek@@ i : jo@@ int sitting of parliament fe@@ bru@@ ary 2008 
mr j@@ ac@@ o@@ b z@@ uma , form@@ er deputy president of the republic and president of the african national con@@ gres@@ s ; 
chair@@ person of sal@@ g@@ a , may@@ ors and lea@@ ders in our system of local government ; 
chair@@ person of the national hou@@ se of traditional lea@@ ders and our hon@@ ou@@ red traditional lea@@ ders ; 
al@@ low me on this occ@@ asi@@ on of the pen@@ ulti@@ mate jo@@ int sitting of the third parliament for the annual deb@@ ate on the state of our n@@ ation , to wish all the hon@@ our@@ able members of parliament a happ@@ y and productive new year . 
i am conf@@ ident that 2008 will be one of the most re@@ mark@@ able years of our demo@@ cracy , as we all work together to re@@ ali@@ se the c@@ ore asp@@ ir@@ ation of our people to at@@ tain a better life for all . 
i sa@@ y this because , in our own esti@@ m@@ ation , it is not often that a n@@ ation is called up@@ on to str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to at@@ tain a dre@@ am . 
and such is the in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion that histor@@ y has im@@ posed on us to@@ day . 
i spe@@ ak here to@@ day in the pres@@ ence of my mother , e@@ pa@@ in@@ ette m@@ bek@@ i , m@@ am@@ o@@ fo@@ ken@@ g , who c@@ ame to communic@@ ate an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal m@@ ess@@ age from the rural m@@ ass@@ es of the tran@@ sk@@ ei , among whom she has li@@ ved for many dec@@ ades . 
she says these m@@ ass@@ es de@@ m@@ and of all of us who claim to be their lea@@ ders , that we tel@@ l them and oth@@ ers like them el@@ se@@ where in our country , whether we remain commit@@ ted to the under@@ taking we have made that t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w will be better than to@@ day . 
in eight days time , on fe@@ bru@@ ary 16 , she will be 9@@ 2 years old . 
what she exp@@ ec@@ ts as her bir@@ th@@ day present is the tr@@ u@@ th . 
i th@@ ank her for taking the tro@@ ub@@ le to be with us to@@ day , and trust that we will not dis@@ appoint her . 
i would also like to take this opportun@@ ity to s@@ alu@@ te president nel@@ s@@ on mand@@ ela , one of the pre@@ -@@ em@@ in@@ ent f@@ oun@@ ding f@@ ath@@ ers of our demo@@ cracy , who will mark his 90@@ th bir@@ th@@ day on 18 j@@ uly this year . 
we wel@@ come to this occ@@ asi@@ on mr ar@@ th@@ ur mar@@ ge@@ man , repres@@ enting the v@@ eter@@ ans of the al@@ ex@@ and@@ ra b@@ us bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t of fi@@ f@@ ty years ag@@ o , who include nel@@ s@@ on mand@@ ela . 
we are also pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to have among us ms j@@ an@@ n tur@@ ner , the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter of ric@@ k tur@@ ner who was m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed by ap@@ ar@@ theid agents 30 years ag@@ o . 
we are also ple@@ ased that we have among us mr din@@ il@@ esi@@ z@@ we so@@ bu@@ k@@ we , s@@ on of the out@@ standing pa@@ tri@@ ot and le@@ ader , ro@@ ber@@ t so@@ bu@@ k@@ we , who also passed a@@ way 30 years back after end@@ uring many years of im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment , b@@ anis@@ h@@ ment and other forms of repres@@ sion . 
we ac@@ knowledge , both among the hon@@ our@@ able members and our gu@@ ests , the many f@@ oun@@ ders of the uni@@ ted demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c f@@ ron@@ t , 25 years ag@@ o . 
all these hon@@ ou@@ red gu@@ ests , repres@@ enting both m@@ em@@ ory and h@@ ope , re@@ min@@ d us by their pres@@ ence that ours is a t@@ ask in a rela@@ y r@@ ace of continu@@ ous re@@ birth so that the dre@@ am of a better life becomes a re@@ ality for all south afric@@ ans . 
in@@ de@@ ed , they repres@@ ent a c@@ ele@@ bration of the ind@@ om@@ it@@ able sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of our people , and pose a chall@@ en@@ ge to all of us to act in ways that do not be@@ tra@@ y or dis@@ appoint the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the people . 
we are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c parliament and government soon after which we will hold our f@@ our@@ th general elec@@ tions . 
the government has therefore re@@ view@@ ed the di@@ stance we have travel@@ led in terms of implementing the mand@@ ate given by the people in 2004 . 
i am ple@@ ased to sa@@ y that we have in@@ de@@ ed done much to imple@@ ment the commit@@ ments we made to the people in 2004 . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , and not un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ly , it is ob@@ vi@@ ous that we still have out@@ standing work to do in this regard . 
happ@@ ily , this state of the n@@ ation address has given me the pos@@ sibi@@ lity to report to parliament and the n@@ ation on our 24 ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ or@@ ities which , the h@@ on members can find on the government website during the course of next week . 
the identi@@ fication of the ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ or@@ ities means that all three spher@@ es of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are her@@ e@@ by making the fir@@ m under@@ taking that we will use the sh@@ ort period a@@ head of us further to en@@ erg@@ ise our adv@@ ance towards the re@@ alisation of the all@@ -@@ important go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
the enti@@ re@@ ty of our system of govern@@ ance is therefore making the commit@@ ment that in the period a@@ head of us , it will do its best to live up to the im@@ per@@ ative â business un@@ us@@ ual !
we spe@@ ak of business un@@ us@@ ual not refer@@ ring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the spe@@ ed@@ y , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the li@@ ves of our people should change for the better , so@@ on@@ er ra@@ ther than later . 
to make certain that this happ@@ ens , we have taken the necessary ste@@ ps to ensure that the annual bud@@ get the minister of fin@@ ance will present later this month mak@@ es the necessary allocations to give us the means to imple@@ ment the ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ or@@ ities . 
the main categories of these pri@@ or@@ ities are : 
impro@@ ving the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of our inter@@ ven@@ tions direc@@ ted at the second econ@@ omy , and p@@ over@@ ty er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation 
en@@ han@@ cing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some african issues and s@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ south relations . 
more than at any other time , the situ@@ ation that conf@@ ron@@ ts our n@@ ation and country , and the ta@@ sk@@ s we have set our@@ sel@@ ves , de@@ m@@ and that we in@@ sp@@ i@@ re and organis@@ e all our people to act together as one , to do all the th@@ ings that have to be done , under@@ standing that in a very re@@ al s@@ ense , all of us , together , hold our own fu@@ ture in our hand@@ s ! 
as we act together ever@@ y@@ where in our country , this we must also under@@ stand that what we have to be about is â business un@@ us@@ ual ! 
as i was prepar@@ ing this address , one among us su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted to me that our country was being bu@@ ff@@ e@@ ted by str@@ ong c@@ ro@@ ss@@ win@@ ds that made it especially diffic@@ ult to for@@ es@@ ee where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . 
he su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted that this mor@@ ning , to cap@@ ture what he consi@@ ders the ess@@ ence of the re@@ ality conf@@ ron@@ ting us , i should rec@@ all the well@@ -@@ kno@@ wn word@@ s with which char@@ les di@@ ck@@ ens op@@ ened his no@@ vel , a tale of two ci@@ ties . 
and so i qu@@ o@@ te these word@@ s : 
it was the best of times , it was the wor@@ st of times , it was the age of wis@@ d@@ om , it was the age of f@@ oo@@ lis@@ h@@ ness , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of be@@ li@@ ef , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of inc@@ re@@ du@@ lity , it was the se@@ as@@ on of light , it was the se@@ as@@ on of d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness , it was the sp@@ ring of h@@ ope , it was the win@@ ter of des@@ pai@@ r , we had ever@@ y@@ thing before us , we had no@@ thing before us , we were all going direct to he@@ av@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - in sh@@ ort , the period was so f@@ ar like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est author@@ ities in@@ si@@ sted on its being received , for good or for e@@ vi@@ l , in the su@@ per@@ l@@ ative deg@@ ree of com@@ par@@ ison only . 
you will ask whether i ag@@ ree with this assessment , whether i to@@ o be@@ li@@ eve that we have enter@@ ed an er@@ a of conf@@ u@@ sion , in which all of us cannot but lo@@ se our way , un@@ sure of our ste@@ ps , un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y on our fe@@ et , f@@ ear@@ ful of the fu@@ ture ! 
my an@@ sw@@ er to this ques@@ tion is a defin@@ i@@ te no !
like the rest of our government i am con@@ vin@@ ced that the fun@@ da@@ ment@@ als that have inform@@ ed our countr@@ ys for@@ ward mar@@ ch in the last 14 years remain in place . 
they continue to provide us with the str@@ ong b@@ ase from which we must proc@@ eed as we ke@@ ep our e@@ y@@ es fir@@ m@@ ly foc@@ used on the continu@@ ed p@@ urs@@ uit of the go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
th@@ us should we all re@@ affir@@ m that we remain on course as we continue to str@@ i@@ ve to make ours a win@@ ning n@@ ation . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , like all the hon@@ our@@ able members , i am aw@@ are of the f@@ act that many in our soci@@ ety are tro@@ ub@@ led by a de@@ ep s@@ ense of un@@ e@@ ase about where our country will be t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . 
they are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been th@@ ro@@ wn by the un@@ exp@@ ected dis@@ rup@@ tions in the supp@@ ly of elec@@ tricity . 
they are concerned about some develop@@ ments in our econ@@ omy , especially the ste@@ ad@@ y increase in interest rates , food and fu@@ el p@@ ric@@ es which further imp@@ over@@ is@@ h especially the poor . 
some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own econ@@ omy of the th@@ re@@ at of economic rec@@ es@@ sion in the uni@@ ted st@@ ates . 
they are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether we have the capacity to def@@ end the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c rights and the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c constitution which were bor@@ n of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . 
this is d@@ riv@@ en by such develop@@ ments as the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the national commissioner of police , the su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of the national director of public prosecu@@ tions , f@@ ear@@ s about a th@@ re@@ at to the in@@ depend@@ ence of the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the r@@ ule of law , and the atten@@ d@@ ant al@@ leg@@ ations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
they are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether our country is th@@ reat@@ ened by the an@@ ar@@ ch@@ y repres@@ ented by the criminal tor@@ ch@@ ing of six p@@ assen@@ ger train@@ s in ts@@ h@@ wan@@ e last month . 
while they recogn@@ ise and respect the right of the r@@ ul@@ ing party to regula@@ te its own af@@ fairs , they are concerned that it must continue to pla@@ y its role as one of the princi@@ pal ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ts of a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , non@@ ra@@ cial , non@@ s@@ exis@@ t and pro@@ sper@@ ous south africa . 
most ob@@ vi@@ ously it would be ir@@ responsible to i@@ gn@@ ore these and other concer@@ ns or dis@@ mis@@ s them as m@@ ere j@@ er@@ em@@ i@@ ads ty@@ p@@ ical of the pro@@ ph@@ ets of d@@ oo@@ m . 
let me therefore make b@@ old to sa@@ y that this histor@@ ical mo@@ ment de@@ mand@@ s that our n@@ ation should uni@@ te as ne@@ ver before and str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to address our common chall@@ eng@@ es and ke@@ ep ali@@ ve the dre@@ am that has sustain@@ ed all of us as we travel@@ led al@@ ong the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the cre@@ ation of the south africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our constitution . 
the national emergency repres@@ ented by the current power out@@ ages pos@@ es the chall@@ en@@ ge and pres@@ ents the opportun@@ ity to the enti@@ re@@ ty of our n@@ ation to give con@@ cre@@ te ex@@ pres@@ sion to the call we have j@@ ust made for all of us to uni@@ te in action and act in un@@ ity to ke@@ ep our country on course . 
this must sa@@ y to all of us that we are in@@ de@@ ed in a period of chall@@ eng@@ es , but sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table chall@@ eng@@ es . 
and prec@@ is@@ ely because it is a period of chall@@ eng@@ es , it is also an er@@ a of opportun@@ ity ! 
in this regard , i would like to ex@@ pres@@ s our app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation and full agreement with the com@@ ments made by the chief executive of ang@@ l@@ o am@@ er@@ ic@@ an , c@@ yn@@ th@@ ia car@@ ro@@ ll , when she addres@@ sed the min@@ ing indaba here in cape town ear@@ lier this week , on tu@@ es@@ day , fe@@ bru@@ ary 5 . 
as the hon@@ our@@ able members know , she said : i don@@ t regard the problems of en@@ ergy supp@@ ly here as a dis@@ aster . 
and south africa is not al@@ one : there are pres@@ su@@ res on supp@@ ly regarding our exp@@ an@@ sion projects in ch@@ ile and br@@ az@@ il . 
sure , the problems here are serious ; 
but if all of us can for@@ ge str@@ ong part@@ nershi@@ ps to t@@ ack@@ le the situ@@ ation , we will all come through â i h@@ ope rel@@ ati@@ vely un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed this is not a time for f@@ ing@@ er poin@@ ting , but for working together in fin@@ ding so@@ lu@@ tions . 
this having been said , it is ho@@ we@@ ver also necessary that we take this opportun@@ ity to con@@ ve@@ y to the country the ap@@ o@@ log@@ ies of both the government and es@@ kom for the national emergency which has resul@@ ted in all of us having to cont@@ end with the con@@ sequ@@ ences of load sh@@ ed@@ ding . 
i would also like to th@@ ank all citizens for their res@@ ili@@ ence and for@@ be@@ aring in the fac@@ e of the current diffic@@ ul@@ ties . 
in the p@@ ast two weeks , the ministers of min@@ er@@ als and en@@ ergy and public enterpris@@ es have out@@ lin@@ ed the nature of the emergency we conf@@ ron@@ t and what each one of us can do to nor@@ ma@@ li@@ se the situ@@ ation . 
last week the hon@@ our@@ able members had an opportun@@ ity to reflec@@ t on these matters . 
in ess@@ ence the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant r@@ ise in elec@@ tricity de@@ m@@ and over the last two years has ou@@ ts@@ tri@@ p@@ p@@ ed the new capacity we have b@@ rou@@ ght on stre@@ am . 
the res@@ ult@@ ant ti@@ ght supp@@ ly situ@@ ation mak@@ es the over@@ all system vul@@ ner@@ able to any incid@@ ent affec@@ ting the availa@@ bility of en@@ ergy . 
in this situ@@ ation , we have to cur@@ t@@ ail the un@@ plan@@ ned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immedi@@ ately is re@@ duce de@@ m@@ and and th@@ us ensure a better res@@ erve mar@@ g@@ in . 
as government our t@@ ask is to now le@@ ad and uni@@ te the country be@@ hin@@ d a c@@ ampaign for en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency that will address this chall@@ en@@ ge . 
among other th@@ ings , we must use the current ad@@ versity to ensure that our hom@@ es and econ@@ omy become more en@@ ergy efficient . 
there are con@@ cre@@ te ac@@ tions each individual , hou@@ se@@ hold and business can take . 
these are being dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ated by the department of min@@ er@@ als and en@@ ergy and we remain open to any other su@@ g@@ ges@@ tions that you , our com@@ pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts , may give to us and share with one another . 
die regering sal begin met die implementering van â@@ @@ n veldtog om doeltreffende be@@ ligting te verseker , asook water@@ v@@ eh@@ it@@ ting deur middel van son@@ krag , die beheer van die la@@ s van war@@ m@@ water@@ toes@@ tel@@ le in huis@@ houd@@ ings , insluit@@ end behuis@@ ing@@ standaarde vir alle nuwe huis@@ e en ontwikkel@@ ings . 
an in@@ struction has been issued for all government buil@@ dings to re@@ duce their consum@@ ption of elec@@ tricity and please fe@@ el free to name and sh@@ ame those who do not . 
on the supp@@ ly side es@@ kom is working f@@ uri@@ ously to ensure the intro@@ duction of co-@@ gener@@ ation projects as a matter of ur@@ gency . 
we are taking ste@@ ps to en@@ h@@ ance es@@ kom@@ s maintenance capacity . 
we have emergency t@@ ask te@@ ams de@@ aling with the chall@@ en@@ ge of co@@ al quality and supp@@ ly with the co@@ al min@@ ing industry and we are working to f@@ ast trac@@ k the appro@@ val and con@@ struction of g@@ as tur@@ bin@@ e projects . 
all these ac@@ tions , taken together with the elec@@ tricity sav@@ ing measures , will improve cer@@ tain@@ ty and ra@@ ise the res@@ erve mar@@ g@@ in . 
the m@@ assi@@ ve es@@ kom build programme in new gener@@ ation , trans@@ mission and distribu@@ tion capacity will continue ; 
in this regard , i would like to th@@ ank the private sector for being prepar@@ ed to assist in wh@@ ate@@ ver way they can . 
in a me@@ eting with the chair@@ man of general elec@@ tric during the course of last week , ge offered to assist by proc@@ uring s@@ car@@ ce tur@@ bin@@ e equipment on our behalf . 
in south africa our own lar@@ ge compan@@ ies such as s@@ as@@ o@@ l , ang@@ l@@ o and b@@ h@@ p b@@ illi@@ ton are all in con@@ cre@@ te disc@@ us@@ sions with the departments of min@@ er@@ al and en@@ ergy and public enterpris@@ es to find cost effective and sustainable so@@ lu@@ tions to the supp@@ ly con@@ str@@ ain@@ t . 
the appro@@ ach is one of common action ra@@ ther than rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation . 
i particul@@ arly want to pay tribu@@ te to the min@@ ing industry for the way in which they have assi@@ sted us and the econ@@ omy to resol@@ ve a re@@ al cri@@ sis that hi@@ t us on the 24@@ th of j@@ an@@ u@@ ary . 
we will all work to minim@@ ise the adver@@ se impact these events had on the industry . 
collec@@ tive ef@@ for@@ t and consult@@ ation are at the centre of our respon@@ se to the emergency . 
t@@ ask te@@ ams are currently working in many areas . 
next week the provincial pre@@ mi@@ ers will con@@ ven@@ e their for@@ a with may@@ ors to plan and imple@@ ment the en@@ ergy sav@@ ing measures in all the municipalities ac@@ ross the country . 
they will be sup@@ ported by technical te@@ ams from ed@@ i hol@@ dings , es@@ kom and the national en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency ag@@ ency . 
the department of provincial and local government will coordin@@ ate this activ@@ ity sup@@ ported by the line departments of min@@ er@@ al and en@@ ergy and public enterpris@@ es . 
the minister of fin@@ ance will provide more information in the bud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h on the support that the government will provide for the en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency c@@ ampaign and to es@@ kom in its build programme . 
we fac@@ e an emergency but we can over@@ come the problems in a rel@@ ati@@ vely sh@@ ort period . 
this situ@@ ation has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able re@@ alisation that the er@@ a of very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p and ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant elec@@ tricity has come to an end . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , given our lar@@ ge b@@ ase of inst@@ al@@ led gener@@ ation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain am@@ ong@@ st the few econom@@ ies with af@@ for@@ d@@ able elec@@ tricity . 
we are a min@@ er@@ als resource econ@@ omy . 
we must therefore continue to support the min@@ ing industry . 
it is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that if we are to continue on our growth p@@ ath as a manufac@@ t@@ uring country , we will also have to continue supporting the process@@ ing industry . 
ho@@ we@@ ver it is im@@ per@@ ative that all enterpris@@ es become more en@@ ergy efficient . 
in@@ de@@ ed , en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency it@@ self provides economic opportun@@ ity . 
let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building b@@ loc@@ ks of the ess@@ enti@@ al en@@ ergy efficient fu@@ ture we d@@ are not a@@ vo@@ id . 
let us ensure that all hand@@ s are on de@@ ck to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has hi@@ t us , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the appro@@ ach that our circum@@ stan@@ ces call for business un@@ us@@ ual ! 
this is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same appro@@ ach we must adop@@ t as we continue to prepar@@ e to ho@@ st the fi@@ f@@ a con@@ fe@@ der@@ ations cu@@ p in 2009 and the 2010 fi@@ f@@ a so@@ cc@@ er world cu@@ p which will k@@ ic@@ k off in our country 85@@ 4 days from to@@ day . 
i men@@ tion this important matter here because the current chall@@ eng@@ es we are fac@@ ing have led some el@@ se@@ where in the world once more to ques@@ tion whether we will be able to ho@@ st these t@@ our@@ na@@ ments success@@ fully . 
of course , i have ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te@@ ly no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we will hon@@ our our under@@ taking to fi@@ f@@ a and the world community of so@@ cc@@ er pla@@ y@@ ers and l@@ over@@ s to create all the necessary conditions for the hol@@ ding of the best ever fi@@ f@@ a so@@ cc@@ er world cu@@ p t@@ our@@ na@@ ment . 
the s@@ ense that we get , ac@@ ross all sec@@ tors of south african soci@@ ety and further af@@ i@@ eld , repres@@ ented by the ac@@ tual da@@ ily progres@@ s we are making in terms of our all@@ -@@ ro@@ un@@ d prepar@@ ations , is one of - business un@@ us@@ ual : all hand@@ s on de@@ ck for 2010 !
we must ensure that we su@@ st@@ ain this appro@@ ach . 
we are fully aw@@ are that a cri@@ tical ele@@ ment of our prepar@@ ations should be the building of a str@@ ong south african te@@ am which will do us and the who@@ le of the f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all f@@ ra@@ ternity pro@@ u@@ d . 
i am certain that the south african f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all association , our co@@ ach@@ es led by car@@ lo@@ s al@@ ber@@ to par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , and the pla@@ y@@ ers are aw@@ are of the he@@ av@@ y responsibility they car@@ ry to prepar@@ e a national te@@ am of which both we and africa should be pro@@ u@@ d . 
once more we th@@ ank the sp@@ r@@ ing@@ bo@@ ks for sho@@ wing the way when they w@@ on the rug@@ by world cu@@ p last year . 
this must in@@ sp@@ i@@ re b@@ af@@ ana b@@ af@@ ana , as it must in@@ sp@@ i@@ re our ath@@ le@@ tes who will com@@ pe@@ te in the b@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ol@@ y@@ mp@@ ic g@@ am@@ es later this year . 
let me now tur@@ n to the ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ or@@ ities i mentioned . 
further to acceler@@ ate our economic growth and development we will imple@@ ment the indus@@ trial policy action plan . 
government will continue our indus@@ tri@@ alisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
in this regard , r@@ 2,@@ 3 b@@ illi@@ on has been bud@@ ge@@ ted for indus@@ trial policy initi@@ atives and a further r@@ 5 b@@ illi@@ on in tax inc@@ enti@@ ves over three years will support indus@@ trial policy . 
working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as ur@@ gen@@ tly as possible , key action plan@@ s in sec@@ tors where such plan@@ s do not exis@@ t , such as min@@ ing and min@@ er@@ als benef@@ ici@@ ation , consum@@ er d@@ ur@@ ab@@ les , ret@@ ail with a focus on impro@@ ving support to small enterpris@@ es , con@@ struction , the cre@@ ative industr@@ ies , agric@@ ulture and ag@@ ro@@ -@@ process@@ ing . 
once more i would like to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se that we remain determined to support the aut@@ om@@ o@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the motor industry development programme is main@@ tained . 
at the m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic level , we will continue to maintain a fis@@ cal post@@ ure that sup@@ ports continu@@ ed economic growth and development and re@@ duc@@ ing our ex@@ ternal vul@@ ner@@ ability . 
to spe@@ ed up the process of building infrastructure we will fin@@ ali@@ se the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific em@@ ph@@ asis on en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ency . 
this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s coordin@@ ating the programmes of the state@@ -@@ own@@ ed enterpris@@ es and over@@ la@@ ying all the infrastructure plan@@ s , including fre@@ igh@@ t and other log@@ istics , en@@ ergy pi@@ p@@ el@@ ines , information and communic@@ ations technology , road infrastructure , water and elec@@ tricity , both in terms of their ti@@ ming and geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c loc@@ ation . 
cu@@ tting ac@@ ross these plan@@ s , and therefore a cri@@ tical pri@@ ority , is information and communic@@ ations technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right . 
accord@@ ing@@ ly , we will this year complete the lic@@ ens@@ ing and oper@@ ation@@ alisation of inf@@ rac@@ o . 
already , money has been allocated for sen@@ te@@ ch to become a wi@@ re@@ less inter@@ net w@@ hol@@ es@@ al@@ er as well as fin@@ ance its di@@ gi@@ ti@@ s@@ ation . 
working with other govern@@ ments on the contin@@ ent and the private sector , we will complete the process to laun@@ ch the under@@ se@@ a c@@ ab@@ les . 
at the same time , we aim to provide dig@@ ital bro@@ ad@@ casting to 50 of the pop@@ ulation by the end of the year . 
att@@ ached to this will be a manufac@@ t@@ uring strategy for the development in south africa of set to@@ p box@@ es , which should be fin@@ alised by the mid@@ d@@ le of the year . 
having no@@ ted that the tar@@ din@@ ess with which government processes applications for inves@@ tment in rel@@ ation to issues such as land ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , infrastructure and environmental impact assess@@ ments can at times make or bre@@ ak inves@@ tor deci@@ sions , we have deci@@ ded , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of business un@@ us@@ ual , work is progres@@ sing ur@@ gen@@ tly to set up a call centre through which pro@@ spec@@ tive inves@@ tors and government can trac@@ k these processes . 
an ele@@ ment of govern@@ ments ap@@ e@@ x of pri@@ or@@ ities will be deli@@ ber@@ ate focus on matters of skills development . 
work to review the national human resource development strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the jo@@ int te@@ am of government , labour , business and ac@@ ademi@@ c institutions organis@@ ed under the jo@@ int initi@@ ative on pri@@ ority skills ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion will be inten@@ si@@ fied . 
in@@ de@@ ed , we are gre@@ at@@ ly encour@@ aged by the good respon@@ se from the private sector as de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated through the commit@@ ment by the ce@@ os of 70 of the j@@ se@@ -@@ listed compan@@ ies to work with government in addres@@ sing the chall@@ en@@ ge of s@@ car@@ ce skills . 
in addi@@ tion to this work we will in the com@@ ing period pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ se further inter@@ ven@@ tions in the further education and training col@@ leg@@ es , the sector education and training author@@ ities , resour@@ cing schools in the low@@ est three qu@@ in@@ ti@@ les , f@@ ree@@ ing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and spe@@ eding up on-@@ the@@ -@@ job training for professional gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates . 
further , after correc@@ ting we@@ ak@@ nesses in our ad@@ ult basic education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month laun@@ ch the k@@ ha r@@ i gu@@ de mass liter@@ acy c@@ ampaign . 
this will include the training of m@@ aster train@@ ers who will provide basic liter@@ acy cla@@ s@@ ses to 300 000 ad@@ ults and youth in 2008 . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person 
at the centre of our economic programmes is , and should al@@ ways be , the consider@@ ation whether their succ@@ ess is hel@@ ping to improve the quality of life of all south afric@@ ans , acting as an important weap@@ on in our wa@@ r on p@@ over@@ ty and acceler@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the at@@ tain@@ ment of such objec@@ tives as the re@@ duction of un@@ employment and advan@@ cing the go@@ al of health for all . 
in the programme to provide sustainable human sett@@ le@@ ments , we are now able to provide 2@@ 60 000 housing un@@ its per ann@@ um , and an agreement has been re@@ ached with the south african local government association to place a mor@@ at@@ ori@@ um on the s@@ ale of land that can be av@@ ailed for the housing programme . 
al@@ ong with the progres@@ s we are making in the variety of inter@@ ven@@ tions foc@@ used on p@@ over@@ ty re@@ duction , we continue to address a number many we@@ ak@@ nesses , including the process@@ ing of the land use management bill , the fin@@ alisation of the land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion cases , the support programme for those who ac@@ qui@@ re land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . 
these are some of the issues to which we will pay special atten@@ tion during this year , and ensure that we meet the tar@@ gets we have set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
y@@ et another cri@@ tical ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ ority is the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of an integrated and com@@ prehensive anti@@ -@@ p@@ over@@ ty strategy that addres@@ ses especially sections of the pop@@ ulation most affected by this s@@ cour@@ ge . 
these include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and ur@@ ban inform@@ al sett@@ le@@ ments , people with dis@@ abili@@ ties or ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nesses and the el@@ der@@ ly . 
among the key pro@@ posed inter@@ ven@@ tions are : exp@@ and@@ ing the public works programme , employment subsi@@ dies for direct j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation for tar@@ ge@@ ted group@@ s , en@@ han@@ cing employment search cap@@ ability , impro@@ ving education and training , impro@@ ving services and ass@@ ets among poor communities , specific inter@@ ven@@ tions in poor hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , and ens@@ uring effecti@@ ven@@ ess of institutions supporting women and other sec@@ tors . 
among oth@@ ers , we will make an evalu@@ ation of the gen@@ der mach@@ in@@ er@@ y so as to improve all a@@ spec@@ ts related to women em@@ powerment . 
par@@ alle@@ l to this initi@@ ative is a special project to exam@@ ine inter@@ ven@@ tions required to deal with vul@@ ner@@ able children over the age of 14 . 
but we will all ag@@ ree that our soci@@ ety , and the poor speci@@ fic@@ ally , cannot w@@ ai@@ t for strateg@@ ies and di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ es and work@@ shop@@ s â important as these may be . 
in any case , most of the inter@@ ven@@ tions possible are th@@ ings that government is already do@@ ing th@@ ough not suff@@ ici@@ ently integrated . 
as such , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of business un@@ us@@ ual , government inten@@ ds this year to inten@@ si@@ fy the c@@ ampaign to identi@@ fy specific hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds and individu@@ als in di@@ re need and to put in place inter@@ ven@@ tions that will help , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing period , to alle@@ vi@@ ate their p@@ light in those individual hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds . 
for this , we will require a national wa@@ r ro@@ om for a wa@@ r against p@@ over@@ ty br@@ ing@@ ing together departments such as social development , provincial and local government , trade and industry , agric@@ ulture and land af@@ fairs , public works and health as well as provincial and local administr@@ ations , which will work with non@@ govern@@ mental organisations and business to identi@@ fy the inter@@ ven@@ tions required in specific hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds and imple@@ ment them as a matter of ur@@ gency . 
die ou@@ dit van grond@@ eien@@ aar@@ skap sal ook bes@@ po@@ e@@ dig word . 
sc@@ aling up the national youth service programme including a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ated increase of the in@@ take in the mi@@ li@@ tary skills development programme of the south african national defence force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . 
r@@ 7@@ 00 million has already been given to the s@@ and@@ f to start sc@@ aling up this programme ; 
die uit@@ breiding van die openbare werk@@ e-@@ program , wat , deur die vas@@ gestelde doelwitte te oortre@@ f , die poten@@ siaal ge@@ toon het om meer nu@@ wel@@ inge te ab@@ s@@ or@@ ber . 
about r@@ 1 b@@ illi@@ on over the b@@ as@@ el@@ ine will be allocated to programmes that f@@ all within the ep@@ w@@ p ; 
and through the small enterpris@@ es development ag@@ ency s@@ etting up a rig@@ or@@ ous system to ensure that the 30@@ -@@ day payment period is ob@@ serv@@ ed . 
we will also integr@@ ate the programme to spe@@ ed up the development of sustainable human sett@@ le@@ ments , with inten@@ si@@ fied ef@@ for@@ ts , as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ent pri@@ ority , to acceler@@ ate uni@@ ver@@ sal access to water , sanit@@ ation and elec@@ tricity , so that by 201@@ 4 , we should have dec@@ ent human sett@@ le@@ ments and access by all hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds to these services . 
acceler@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ e@@ ment of a go@@ al of health for all includes inten@@ si@@ fied implementation of the national strategi@@ c plan against hi@@ v and a@@ ids . 
we also aim during the course of this year to re@@ duce t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ sis de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , tra@@ in over 3 000 health person@@ nel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi@@ -@@ dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant and ex@@ tre@@ me dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ tant t@@ b patients receive treatment . 
we aim to complete the work on the com@@ prehensive social security system , benefit@@ ing from the consult@@ ations that have star@@ ted with social part@@ ners . 
as we put all our hand@@ s on de@@ ck and ge@@ ar our@@ sel@@ ves for business un@@ us@@ ual we should also inten@@ si@@ fy national di@@ al@@ og@@ ue on the issues that defin@@ e us as a n@@ ation . 
two such issues des@@ erve brief men@@ tion . 
the first of these is a pro@@ po@@ sal that we should develop an o@@ ath that will be re@@ ci@@ ted by learners in their mor@@ ning school ass@@ emb@@ lies , as well as a youth ple@@ dge ex@@ tol@@ ling the vir@@ tu@@ es of h@@ um@@ ane conduct and human soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity among all south afric@@ ans . 
the minister of education will next week el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the national deb@@ ate on these matters . 
the second issue is about geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c and place names , which requi@@ res a syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process ac@@ ross all provinces so we can create a b@@ ase sla@@ te of changes we pro@@ pose . 
we will laun@@ ch this syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process soon , g@@ ui@@ ded by the south african geo@@ graph@@ ical names council and its provincial committees . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person , when we reflec@@ ted on the issue of crime at last years jo@@ int sitting of parliament , we all ex@@ pres@@ sed gr@@ ave concer@@ n not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indic@@ ation that th@@ ings se@@ em@@ ed to be tur@@ ning for the wor@@ se especially in respect of m@@ ur@@ der â b@@ uc@@ king the tr@@ end of the impro@@ vement sin@@ ce the at@@ tain@@ ment of demo@@ cracy . 
accord@@ ing@@ ly , last year we eng@@ aged in syste@@ mati@@ c inter@@ action with business and other sec@@ tors of the pop@@ ulation , to develop a ho@@ li@@ stic appro@@ ach towards re@@ v@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system in its to@@ ta@@ lity . 
in this regard , in the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of business un@@ us@@ ual , cabinet has agre@@ ed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , mo@@ der@@ n@@ ised , efficient and transform@@ ed criminal justice system . 
among other th@@ ings , this will ent@@ ail s@@ etting up a new coordin@@ ating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , br@@ ing@@ ing together the judi@@ ci@@ ary and mag@@ istr@@ acy , the police , prosecu@@ tors , cor@@ rectional services and the legal aid bo@@ ard , as well as other inter@@ ven@@ tions , including the em@@ powerment of the community police for@@ ums . 
as the hon@@ our@@ able members are aw@@ are , some of these initi@@ atives are already under way ; 
the ministers of the justice , crime pre@@ vention and security c@@ l@@ us@@ ter will el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the details of this and other initi@@ atives during the course of next week . 
inform@@ ed by the im@@ per@@ ative to inten@@ si@@ fy the off@@ ensive against organis@@ ed crime , as well as the recommend@@ ations of the k@@ h@@ am@@ pe@@ pe judicial commission on the func@@ tion@@ ing and loc@@ ation of the director@@ ate of special oper@@ ations and continu@@ ing reflec@@ tions on this matter , including the re@@ form of the criminal justice system , we shall by the end of mar@@ ch this year , inter@@ act with parliament on legislation and other deci@@ sive measures required further to en@@ h@@ ance our capacity to fi@@ ght organis@@ ed crime . 
what will continue to inform us as we take this ste@@ p will be the ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te commit@@ ment of government to fi@@ ght organis@@ ed crime and improve the management , eff@@ ici@@ ency and coordin@@ ation of our law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement ag@@ en@@ cies . 
of gre@@ at import@@ ance , our succ@@ ess in the fi@@ ght against crime depend@@ s on coo@@ per@@ ation among all of us as law@@ -@@ ab@@ iding citizens , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the principles of r@@ ule of law , respect for our judi@@ ci@@ ary and p@@ urs@@ uit of equal human rights , which our constitution en@@ jo@@ ins us to ob@@ serve in our da@@ ily li@@ ves and pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce@@ ments . 
if any@@ thing , the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of business un@@ us@@ ual should apply to all individu@@ als who car@@ ry the pri@@ vi@@ lege of being public serv@@ ants . 
there are si@@ mp@@ le but ur@@ g@@ ent and cri@@ tical pri@@ or@@ ities we will atten@@ d to , as part of the over@@ all ef@@ for@@ t to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
fir@@ st@@ ly , it has been agre@@ ed ac@@ ross all spher@@ es of government that especially the cri@@ tical vac@@ an@@ cies should be fil@@ led within six months of such op@@ en@@ ings emer@@ ging . 
the department of public service and administration will set up a monitoring system to trac@@ k the implementation of this decision . 
sec@@ ond@@ ly , by may of every year all senior man@@ ag@@ ers should have fi@@ led their key performance agreements with relevant author@@ ities . 
the office of the public service commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . 
thir@@ d@@ ly , recogn@@ ising that the department of home af@@ fairs t@@ ou@@ ches the c@@ ore of every citizens life , we will this year inten@@ si@@ fy the implementation of the tur@@ n@@ around strategy approved by cabinet . 
this includes impro@@ ving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ o@@ ting out cor@@ rup@@ t ele@@ ments and pil@@ o@@ ting the new id card . 
impro@@ vement of performance in the public service also depend@@ s on the quality of lea@@ ders@@ hip provided by the executive and senior management . 
further , it is cri@@ tical to en@@ h@@ ance the commit@@ ment of public employees to their duties â a t@@ ask that bel@@ on@@ gs to the lea@@ ders@@ hip , the public serv@@ ants them@@ sel@@ ves and the trade uni@@ on mo@@ vement . 
in this regard , this year , in consult@@ ation with public sector uni@@ ons , we will con@@ ven@@ e a public sector sum@@ mit to th@@ ras@@ h out these issues so that the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of b@@ ath@@ o p@@ ele can find con@@ cre@@ te ex@@ pres@@ sion wh@@ er@@ ever a government service is provided . 
working with other social part@@ ners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second national anti@@ cor@@ ruption programme is adopted , and that the action plan agre@@ ed with organis@@ ed business is implemen@@ ted . 
at local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anti@@ cor@@ ruption strateg@@ ies . 
we shall continue this year to inten@@ si@@ fy ef@@ for@@ ts to streng@@ then local government capacity in line with the 5-@@ year local government strategi@@ c ag@@ end@@ a . 
to ensure syste@@ mati@@ c monitoring in this regard , sal@@ g@@ a has agre@@ ed to provide qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly reports on the work being done . 
in order further to improve the service being provided to vul@@ ner@@ able sec@@ tors such as v@@ eter@@ ans , women and youth , we shall review the structures deleg@@ ated to car@@ ry out these functions and exam@@ ine the most appropriate arran@@ ge@@ ments , including the evalu@@ ation of the government structures speci@@ fic@@ ally established to focus on youth development and em@@ powerment . 
many of the chall@@ eng@@ es in our work which we have identified deri@@ ve from serious we@@ ak@@ nesses in terms of our planning . 
th@@ us , as part of our ap@@ e@@ x pri@@ or@@ ities in the com@@ ing period we will complete the processes that will en@@ able us to en@@ h@@ ance govern@@ ments capacity to put in place re@@ ali@@ stic and integrated plan@@ s , cover@@ ing all spher@@ es of government . 
the programme that we have out@@ lin@@ ed incorpor@@ ates the commit@@ ments that our country has agre@@ ed with the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the contin@@ ent through the african pe@@ er review mechanis@@ m . 
our focus , in promo@@ ting the african ag@@ end@@ a this year , will be on the streng@@ th@@ ening of the african institutions , including the african uni@@ on and its development programme , ne@@ pa@@ d . 
this we shall do , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by the common asp@@ ir@@ ation of the pe@@ opl@@ es of the contin@@ ent for greater integr@@ ation in p@@ urs@@ uit of contin@@ ental un@@ ity at all levels . 
a cri@@ tical ste@@ p in this regard is the con@@ soli@@ d@@ ation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achiev@@ ing regional integr@@ ation . 
we continue to be commit@@ ted to a free trade area in the s@@ ou@@ thern african development community , and h@@ ope to use our chair@@ person@@ ship of s@@ ad@@ c in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 2009 further to give imp@@ et@@ us to the regional en@@ de@@ av@@ ours in this regard . 
it is in this con@@ text , as well , that we shall continue our bi@@ la@@ ter@@ al and multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al inter@@ ac@@ tions with our n@@ eighbour@@ s and the e@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an uni@@ on , within the con@@ text of the process led by the african uni@@ on , to ensure that the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the economic part@@ nership agreement are completed as soon as possible , premis@@ ed on acceler@@ ating the development of our reg@@ ion . 
over the p@@ ast year , we car@@ ri@@ ed out the mand@@ ate of s@@ ad@@ c to assist the political lea@@ ders@@ hip of z@@ im@@ bab@@ we to find a la@@ sting so@@ lution to the political chall@@ eng@@ es they fac@@ e . 
we had an opportun@@ ity , on the fr@@ ing@@ es of the au sum@@ mit in addi@@ s ab@@ aba form@@ ally to present a com@@ prehensive report to the lea@@ ders@@ hip of s@@ ad@@ c on this matter . 
in sh@@ ort , the parties involved in the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue have re@@ ached full agreement on all matters relating to the substan@@ tive matters the parties had to address . 
these include issues relating to the constitution , security , media and elec@@ toral laws , and other matters that have been in cont@@ en@@ tion for many years . 
the relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amend@@ ments . 
what is out@@ standing , ho@@ we@@ ver , is a proced@@ ural matter relating to the ti@@ ming and the manner of enac@@ tment of the new agre@@ ed dr@@ aft constitution . 
accord@@ ing@@ ly , we jo@@ in the s@@ ad@@ c he@@ ads of state and government in con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ ting the parties to the z@@ im@@ bab@@ we di@@ al@@ og@@ ue for their tr@@ uly com@@ mend@@ able achiev@@ e@@ ments and encour@@ age them to work together to resol@@ ve the remain@@ ing proced@@ ural matter . 
as requ@@ ested by the s@@ ad@@ c he@@ ads of state and government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the z@@ im@@ bab@@ we neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations . 
at the same time , we wish the people of z@@ im@@ bab@@ we succ@@ ess in the elec@@ tions sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led for the 29@@ th of mar@@ ch . 
our multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ted relations with the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c republic of con@@ go will continue , as we se@@ ek to contribu@@ te to the ef@@ for@@ ts of the si@@ ster people of that country to at@@ tain la@@ sting pe@@ ace , and imple@@ ment their re@@ con@@ struction and development programme . 
our government will remain s@@ ei@@ z@@ ed of the processes under way in ken@@ y@@ a , ch@@ ad , bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , d@@ ar@@ f@@ ur in the su@@ dan , wes@@ tern sa@@ har@@ a , c@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te di@@ vo@@ i@@ re , s@@ om@@ ali@@ a , the com@@ or@@ os and the c@@ entral african republic to find la@@ sting pe@@ ace and st@@ ability . 
we call on all african com@@ pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts to do wh@@ ate@@ ver we can , together to help bring a stop to all these neg@@ ative develop@@ ments . 
we will , of course , continue to car@@ ry out our ta@@ sk@@ s in the uni@@ ted n@@ ations security council . 
cri@@ tical in this regard , is the streng@@ th@@ ening of coo@@ per@@ ation between the un security council and the pe@@ ace and security council of the african uni@@ on . 
imp@@ el@@ led by the desi@@ re to promote the impro@@ vement in the quality of life of all pe@@ opl@@ es , particul@@ arly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further streng@@ th@@ ening our participation in the indi@@ a-@@ br@@ az@@ il@@ -@@ south africa for@@ ums , the new afric@@ a-@@ asi@@ a strategi@@ c part@@ nership , the non-@@ a@@ lig@@ ned mo@@ vement , the group of 77 and neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to complete the s@@ ac@@ u@@ -@@ mer@@ c@@ us@@ or trade agreement . 
in the same meas@@ ure , we shall continue to contribu@@ te to the re@@ alisation of the objec@@ tives of the k@@ y@@ o@@ to pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on cli@@ mate change and on@@ going impro@@ ve@@ ments in this regard , and in gi@@ ving further imp@@ et@@ us to the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the w@@ to do@@ ha development ro@@ un@@ d . 
this year we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the ten@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the establish@@ ment of dipl@@ omati@@ c relations between south africa and the pe@@ opl@@ es republic of ch@@ ina . 
the m@@ us@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ ing of relations in a variety of areas between our govern@@ ments and pe@@ opl@@ es confir@@ ms that the ch@@ in@@ a-@@ south africa part@@ nership for growth and development is a strategi@@ c rel@@ ation@@ ship of mu@@ tual benefit , which can only gro@@ w from streng@@ th to streng@@ th . 
next year , south africa will pla@@ y ho@@ st to the review con@@ fer@@ ence to evalu@@ ate the implementation of the deci@@ sions of the world con@@ fer@@ ence against rac@@ is@@ m which was held in our country in 2001 . 
we are conf@@ ident that , inform@@ ed by their ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ence of the s@@ cour@@ ge of rac@@ is@@ m and the de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating con@@ sequ@@ ences it continu@@ es to ex@@ act on h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , the govern@@ ments and pe@@ opl@@ es of the world will work together with us to ensure that the review con@@ fer@@ ence achiev@@ es its objec@@ tives . 
these glob@@ al responsibi@@ lities , including the ho@@ sting of the 2010 fi@@ f@@ a so@@ cc@@ er world cu@@ p , bring out in even b@@ ol@@ der re@@ li@@ ef the conf@@ id@@ ence that h@@ um@@ an@@ ity has in our country as a strategi@@ c pla@@ y@@ er in the no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ ours of all h@@ um@@ an@@ ity . 
but we should not take this for granted . 
i am conf@@ ident that , under the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the international marketing council , trade and inves@@ tment south africa , tourism south africa and other ag@@ en@@ cies we shall all put our hand@@ s on de@@ ck to communic@@ ate to the rest of the world the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of business un@@ us@@ ual , and our continu@@ ing adv@@ ance towards the cre@@ ation of a soci@@ ety that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to ga@@ ther in our country to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate afric@@ as h@@ um@@ an@@ ity in 2010 . 
what i do know and her@@ e@@ by make b@@ old to sa@@ y is : wh@@ ate@@ ver the chall@@ eng@@ es of the mo@@ ment , we are still on course ! 
i sa@@ y this with un@@ sh@@ ake@@ able con@@ vic@@ tion because i am certain that south afric@@ ans are capable and ge@@ ar@@ ed to meet the chall@@ en@@ ge of histor@@ y â to str@@ ain every sin@@ e@@ w of our being â to respon@@ d to the national chall@@ eng@@ es of the day , including those relating to our econ@@ omy , the political and economic situ@@ ation in africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world , and s@@ ei@@ z@@ e the opportunities that our countr@@ ys progres@@ s over the last f@@ our@@ teen years has provided . 
with all hand@@ s on de@@ ck , and commit@@ ted to conduct our business in an un@@ us@@ ual and more effective f@@ as@@ hi@@ on , we shall su@@ st@@ ain the process of our re@@ con@@ struction and development and take it to even higher levels .

relig@@ ious lea@@ ders and represent@@ atives of civil soci@@ ety ; 
i am pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to address the jo@@ int sitting of the parliament of the republic of south africa , at the begin@@ ning of this last ses@@ sion of our third demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c parliament . 
i stand before the people of south africa with h@@ um@@ i@@ lity at the opportun@@ ity i have had to occ@@ up@@ y the high@@ est office in the land as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of the uni@@ qu@@ e circum@@ stance ar@@ ising out of the decision of the le@@ ading party in government to rec@@ all the form@@ er president . 
min@@ e is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to le@@ ad the national executive in com@@ pl@@ eting the mand@@ ate accor@@ ded the african national con@@ gres@@ s in the 2004 elec@@ tions , and in la@@ ying the f@@ oundation for the post@@ -@@ election administration to hi@@ t the groun@@ d r@@ un@@ ning . 
that we were able five months ag@@ o to ensure a se@@ am@@ less tran@@ si@@ tion and continu@@ ity in the systems of government is th@@ an@@ ks to the mat@@ urity of our constitutional system , reflec@@ ted in part in the coo@@ per@@ ation of members of the executive â old and new â and the ste@@ ad@@ y hand of our public sector man@@ ag@@ ers . 
as we l@@ ook back over the p@@ ast fi@@ f@@ teen years , i wish to ac@@ knowledge the commit@@ ment and h@@ ard work of presid@@ ents nel@@ s@@ on mand@@ ela and th@@ ab@@ o m@@ bek@@ i and the many women and m@@ en who pla@@ y@@ ed their role in ste@@ ering the ship of state under demo@@ cracy : in the executive and the administration , the legislatures ac@@ ross the three spher@@ es of government and the judi@@ ci@@ ary ; 
d@@ riv@@ en by the desi@@ re to improve the quality of life of all south afric@@ ans . 
above all , i stand before you with pri@@ de and conf@@ id@@ ence that the south africa we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate to@@ day â wor@@ l@@ ds ap@@ ar@@ t from the di@@ visi@@ ons , conflic@@ t and exclu@@ sion of a m@@ ere 15 years ag@@ o â is a product of the la@@ bour@@ s and to@@ il@@ s of south african women and m@@ en from all w@@ al@@ ks of life . 
these south afric@@ ans repres@@ ent the h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence that character@@ ise our n@@ ation . 
within the g@@ al@@ ax@@ y of out@@ standing south afric@@ ans are members of our demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c parliament to whom we had the mis@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ e sin@@ ce last fe@@ bru@@ ary to bi@@ d the fin@@ al f@@ are@@ well . 
they include bri@@ an bun@@ ting , bil@@ ly n@@ air , n@@ c@@ um@@ is@@ a k@@ ond@@ l@@ o , jo@@ h@@ n g@@ om@@ om@@ o , jo@@ e n@@ h@@ lan@@ h@@ l@@ a , cas sal@@ oo@@ j@@ ee , jo@@ h@@ n sch@@ i@@ p@@ per@@ s and j@@ an van eck . 
to these , i would also like to ad@@ d ms hel@@ en su@@ z@@ man , a tr@@ uly di@@ st@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed south african , who repres@@ ented the values of our new parliament in the ch@@ amb@@ ers of the old . 
it is these and other pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts who should take the gre@@ at@@ est share of the ac@@ co@@ la@@ de when we pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce that â wh@@ ate@@ ver economic stor@@ ms may p@@ ound our sh@@ or@@ es , wh@@ ate@@ ver political un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties may visit our collec@@ tive cons@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness in a tran@@ si@@ tion â our n@@ ation is in a good state . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , we should not under@@ esti@@ mate the chall@@ eng@@ es we fac@@ e . 
the glob@@ al economic mel@@ t@@ down does pose serious d@@ ang@@ ers for our econ@@ omy in terms of job los@@ ses and the quality of life of our people . 
nat@@ ur@@ ally , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties of a political tran@@ si@@ tion can pose more ques@@ tions than there are currently an@@ sw@@ ers . 
as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , some of us may be m@@ es@@ m@@ eris@@ ed by the tran@@ si@@ ent wa@@ ves of stor@@ my we@@ a@@ ther and h@@ un@@ ch our s@@ hou@@ l@@ ders in the fac@@ e of these he@@ ad@@ win@@ ds of economic tur@@ bul@@ ence and political tu@@ m@@ ult . 
but ours is a j@@ our@@ ney of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence . 
our demo@@ cracy is health@@ y . 
it is ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly gro@@ wing str@@ on@@ ger , under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a constitution har@@ d@@ ly equ@@ al@@ led in the world . 
in@@ de@@ ed , the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of our political eng@@ agement during this se@@ as@@ on of elec@@ toral cont@@ est â which we all ag@@ ree should be dig@@ ni@@ fied and pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul â is the sur@@ est guar@@ ante@@ e of the continu@@ ed sur@@ vi@@ val and de@@ ep@@ ening of our demo@@ cracy . 
it is south afric@@ as people who have ens@@ ured its progres@@ s ; 
al@@ low me , m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and chair@@ person , in this con@@ text to ur@@ ge all e@@ lig@@ i@@ ble south afric@@ ans to register and to vote in the com@@ ing national and provincial elec@@ tions , so that we can sh@@ ap@@ e our d@@ est@@ in@@ y our@@ sel@@ ves . 
this we should do every working day in the municipal offic@@ es , before the vo@@ ters ro@@ ll is clo@@ sed . 
but we should also take advan@@ t@@ age of the special registration week@@ end arran@@ ged by the elec@@ toral commission of south africa t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w and s@@ un@@ day , the 7@@ th and 8@@ th of fe@@ bru@@ ary respec@@ ti@@ vely . 
i should also take this opportun@@ ity to indic@@ ate that i will in the next few days conclu@@ de consult@@ ations with the elec@@ toral commission and the provincial pre@@ mi@@ ers and ann@@ oun@@ ce the date of the elec@@ tions . 
we o@@ we our being as a demo@@ cracy to the people of south africa who , on 27 april 1994 , for the first time collec@@ ti@@ vely took their d@@ est@@ in@@ y into their own hand@@ s . 
through that si@@ mp@@ le but pro@@ found act of casting a bal@@ lo@@ t for a government of all the people of our country , we tur@@ ned our bac@@ ks on a p@@ ast that de@@ h@@ um@@ anis@@ ed us all . 
it is therefore appropriate on this occ@@ asi@@ on to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the adoption of the declaration of the o@@ au ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c committee on s@@ ou@@ thern africa on the ques@@ tion of south africa adopted in a@@ ug@@ ust , 198@@ 9 â comm@@ only kno@@ wn as the har@@ are declaration . 
that initi@@ ative la@@ id the f@@ oundation for glob@@ al cons@@ ens@@ us , through the uni@@ ted n@@ ations , on the appro@@ ach to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations in south africa . 
within south africa , it also inform@@ ed the content of the 198@@ 9 con@@ fer@@ ence for a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c fu@@ ture â br@@ ing@@ ing together pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ts from vir@@ tu@@ ally all w@@ al@@ ks of life . 
all this led to the neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations process which cul@@ min@@ ated in our first demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c elec@@ tions in 1994 . 
in this regard , we should s@@ alu@@ te the late president of the african national con@@ gres@@ s , o@@ li@@ ver reg@@ in@@ al@@ d t@@ amb@@ o , for initi@@ ating and pil@@ o@@ ting through contin@@ ental and world bo@@ dies what bec@@ ame a comp@@ as@@ s for the pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul resolution of the conflic@@ t in our country . 
that cour@@ age@@ ous ste@@ p to de@@ v@@ ise a framework that would se@@ ek pe@@ ace and re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation , in the place of wa@@ r and conflic@@ t , re@@ vers@@ ed for good the f@@ al@@ se da@@ wn of a h@@ un@@ d@@ red years ag@@ o : that is , the conclu@@ sion in 19@@ 09 of the national con@@ vention which pres@@ aged the formation of the uni@@ on of south africa . 
while that con@@ vention defined the ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al integr@@ ity of south africa as we know it to@@ day , it was based on ra@@ cial op@@ pres@@ sion and exclu@@ sion . 
those f@@ ear@@ s and in@@ sec@@ uri@@ ties ga@@ ve r@@ ise to dec@@ ades of res@@ is@@ t@@ ance . 
in this regard , we s@@ alu@@ te that br@@ ave s@@ on of our people , sol@@ om@@ on k@@ al@@ us@@ h@@ i ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u who w@@ ent to the g@@ allow@@ s 30 years ag@@ o with his head held high , in the pro@@ u@@ d knowledge that his bl@@ ood would n@@ ouris@@ h the tree of fre@@ edom . 
al@@ low me to ac@@ knowledge lu@@ cas ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u , bro@@ ther of k@@ al@@ us@@ h@@ i , repres@@ enting the ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u family . 
sol@@ om@@ on ma@@ h@@ lang@@ u was continu@@ ing a tradi@@ tion of the war@@ ri@@ ors of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year , among whom we coun@@ t those under king c@@ et@@ sh@@ way@@ o who in 18@@ 79 de@@ fe@@ ated the bri@@ ti@@ s@@ h ar@@ my in is@@ and@@ l@@ wan@@ a , in defence of the fre@@ edom of the indigenous people of our country and the s@@ over@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty of their lands . 
a h@@ un@@ d@@ red and thir@@ ty years on , we can only mar@@ vel at the h@@ ope and the res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used those st@@ out he@@ ar@@ ts . 
in the centres of learning , the same res@@ is@@ t@@ ance fu@@ el@@ led the re@@ kin@@ d@@ ling of mass str@@ ug@@ g@@ les during the col@@ d win@@ ter after the ban@@ ning of the li@@ ber@@ ation mo@@ vement and the im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment of most of its senior lea@@ ders@@ hip . 
a group of vali@@ ant stud@@ ents bro@@ ke a@@ way from n@@ us@@ as to found the south african stud@@ ents organisation 40 years ag@@ o . 
within this gener@@ ation are the early lea@@ ders of s@@ as@@ o , which inclu@@ ded : str@@ in@@ i m@@ ood@@ ley , pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or bar@@ ney p@@ it@@ y@@ ana , ste@@ ve b@@ ik@@ o , on@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ o@@ t@@ se ti@@ r@@ o , har@@ ry n@@ eng@@ wek@@ hul@@ u , th@@ emb@@ a son@@ o , m@@ ap@@ et@@ l@@ a mo@@ h@@ ap@@ i , mo@@ si@@ ou@@ a le@@ ko@@ ta , jo@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y is@@ sel and m@@ th@@ ul@@ i ka s@@ he@@ z@@ i . 
for in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing h@@ ope in a period of des@@ pai@@ r , we s@@ alu@@ te them . 
in this regard , we wish to ac@@ knowledge on@@ k@@ g@@ op@@ o@@ t@@ se ti@@ ro@@ s c@@ ou@@ si@@ n , p@@ at t@@ l@@ h@@ ag@@ wan@@ a . 
in this con@@ text we also wish to ac@@ knowledge the late ep@@ h@@ r@@ aim mo@@ g@@ ale , the f@@ oun@@ ding president 30 years ag@@ o of the con@@ gres@@ s of south african stud@@ ents , and his pe@@ ers . 
in the to@@ w@@ ering m@@ em@@ ory of these stud@@ ents of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year resid@@ es an ab@@ iding m@@ ess@@ age , that the thir@@ st for fre@@ edom and knowledge bur@@ ns even str@@ on@@ ger in the bos@@ oms of our youth . 
the m@@ ess@@ age of their her@@ o@@ ic de@@ eds r@@ ings tr@@ ue to@@ day as it di@@ d those many years ag@@ o , that we should together exp@@ and the f@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers of opportun@@ ity ; 
that we should in@@ de@@ ed , in the word@@ s of the fre@@ edom char@@ ter , open ever wid@@ er the d@@ oor@@ s of learning and of culture ! 
we call to min@@ d these organisations and lea@@ ders to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se the sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence that inf@@ used the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c str@@ ug@@ g@@ le even when ever@@ y@@ thing loo@@ ked ble@@ ak ; 
we do have to@@ day a well@@ -@@ func@@ tion@@ ing demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c system , based on principles of trans@@ par@@ ency and op@@ enn@@ ess , with num@@ er@@ ous plat@@ forms for public participation and independent institutions mand@@ ated by the constitution to support demo@@ cracy . 
over the years , we have ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly impro@@ ved the structures of govern@@ ance . 
we have buil@@ t a system of health@@ y inter@@ govern@@ mental relations ac@@ ross the spher@@ es , and impro@@ ved integr@@ ation within and among them . 
in@@ de@@ ed , government can be pro@@ u@@ d that we have chan@@ ged the demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c com@@ position of the public service , which in vir@@ tu@@ ally all respec@@ ts appro@@ xim@@ ates the charac@@ ter of our soci@@ ety . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , while women constitu@@ te about 34 of all senior posi@@ tions in the public service , this f@@ al@@ ls sh@@ ort of the tar@@ get of par@@ ity that we had set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
at the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indi@@ cations are that the n@@ ation will this year sur@@ pas@@ s the 32 women represent@@ ation level achiev@@ ed in 2004 and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , even the 40 achiev@@ ed in the 2006 local government elec@@ tions . 
we h@@ ope that all political parties will , as they fin@@ ali@@ se their elec@@ toral li@@ sts , make their contribu@@ tion to this no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ our ! 
th@@ ough some progres@@ s has been made , at 0@@ ,@@ 2 , the situ@@ ation is less im@@ pres@@ sive with regard to people with dis@@ ability employed in government , meas@@ ured against the 2 tar@@ get we set our@@ sel@@ ves . 
on both coun@@ ts , the private sector is lag@@ ging f@@ ar be@@ hin@@ d . 
various measures have been put in place to improve the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the public service , including financial management , th@@ us@@ ong service centres and other service delivery in@@ nov@@ ations , iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and , as currently in the department of home af@@ fairs , fir@@ m lea@@ ders@@ hip . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and ori@@ ent@@ ation of some public serv@@ ants , especially those at the co@@ al-@@ fac@@ e of direct inter@@ action with the public . 
as hon@@ our@@ able members will be aw@@ are , our government has made the fi@@ ght against cor@@ ruption one of the c@@ ore areas of focus . 
this is reflec@@ ted , among oth@@ ers , in legislation , rules and regulations govern@@ ing public serv@@ ants and political offic@@ e-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers a@@ like , part@@ nershi@@ ps with civil soci@@ ety and the business community , as well as anti@@ -@@ cor@@ ruption ho@@ t@@ lin@@ es . 
the same chall@@ eng@@ es conf@@ ron@@ t the private sector . 
i am certain that we are all agre@@ ed that the well@@ being of our soci@@ ety depend@@ s , cri@@ tic@@ ally , on the progres@@ s we make in exp@@ and@@ ing the n@@ ations we@@ alth and ens@@ uring that the benefits of economic growth are shar@@ ed by the people as a who@@ le . 
it is common c@@ ause that , after the economic st@@ ag@@ n@@ ation of the late 19@@ 80@@ s and early 199@@ 0@@ s , south africa has experi@@ enc@@ ed the lon@@ ges@@ t period of sustain@@ ed economic growth sin@@ ce the recor@@ ding of such statisti@@ cs star@@ ted in 19@@ 40 . 
in the first dec@@ ade of fre@@ edom , economic growth a@@ ver@@ aged 3 per year , and this impro@@ ved to 5 per year on a@@ ver@@ age from 2004 to 2007 . 
while the consum@@ er boo@@ m , imp@@ el@@ led by ris@@ ing employment and in@@ comes and low inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates , pla@@ y@@ ed its part in this regard , we are encour@@ aged by the bro@@ ad can@@ vas@@ s of opportunities for further exp@@ an@@ sion going for@@ ward . 
these include , in the first in@@ stance , higher rates of inves@@ tment by both the public and private sec@@ tors . 
in this regard , some five years ag@@ o , we were h@@ over@@ ing around 16 of gro@@ ss fix@@ ed capital formation as a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of gro@@ ss domestic product . such has been the acceler@@ ation in inves@@ tment that to@@ day this fi@@ g@@ ure stand@@ s at 22 , clo@@ s@@ er to the 25 that we projec@@ ted to at@@ tain only in 201@@ 4 . 
this is in part a con@@ sequ@@ ence of deli@@ ber@@ ate programmes by government to exp@@ and public infrastructure . 
it is also a result of policies to improve the cli@@ mate for private sector inv@@ est@@ ments ; 
the focus on micro@@ -@@ economic re@@ forms in the p@@ ast dec@@ ade , and the ef@@ for@@ ts , especially sin@@ ce 2004 more syste@@ mati@@ cally to remo@@ ve the variety of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to growth have had a positive impact . 
it is in this con@@ text that the acceler@@ ated and shar@@ ed growth initi@@ ative is being implemen@@ ted , ens@@ uring that all the cri@@ tical b@@ loc@@ k@@ ages such as infrastructure bo@@ tt@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , integrated indus@@ trial policy and programmes , the skills chall@@ en@@ ge , regula@@ tory g@@ rid@@ loc@@ ks and eff@@ ici@@ ency of government services are addres@@ sed in a foc@@ uss@@ ed and syste@@ mati@@ c manner . 
our econ@@ omy has become more open , and sin@@ ce 1994 it has ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly become integrated into the glob@@ al system . 
our financial institutions are a force of good example which has some@@ what sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed us from the glob@@ al economic stor@@ ms . 
y@@ et , the extent of their re@@ ach within our soci@@ ety remain@@ s f@@ ar below exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations . 
our econ@@ omy remain@@ s lar@@ gel@@ y re@@ li@@ ant on min@@ ing and agric@@ ulture for ex@@ ports . 
except for the services sector , we have not se@@ en a lar@@ ge en@@ ough exp@@ an@@ sion in cri@@ tical sec@@ tors , especially manufac@@ t@@ uring . 
as such , the rate of growth in ex@@ ports has not been as high as in com@@ par@@ able countries . 
it is prec@@ is@@ ely this we@@ ak@@ ness which accoun@@ ts for the lar@@ ge current account def@@ ici@@ t particul@@ arly when we enter@@ ed higher ran@@ ges of growth . 
and because we have a low sav@@ ings rate , we have had to re@@ ly on sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term capital f@@ low@@ s to fin@@ ance the def@@ ici@@ t as well as our inves@@ tment programmes . 
these are chall@@ eng@@ es that our country will cer@@ tain@@ ly have to address going for@@ ward . 
of cri@@ tical import@@ ance is the ques@@ tion : what in f@@ act should economic growth be about ?
we@@ alth is cre@@ ated in order to improve pe@@ opl@@ es quality of life . 
th@@ us , the ques@@ tion whether growth is eq@@ uit@@ ably shar@@ ed should form a c@@ entral pil@@ lar of all our economic consider@@ ations . 
import@@ an@@ tly , sharing the benefits of growth should ent@@ ail la@@ bour@@ -@@ ab@@ s@@ or@@ ption , ens@@ uring that there is dec@@ ent work . 
in this la@@ t@@ ter period , for the first time sin@@ ce the at@@ tain@@ ment of demo@@ cracy , more j@@ ob@@ s were being cre@@ ated than the number of new entr@@ ants into the labour market , th@@ us re@@ duc@@ ing the un@@ employment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . 
of course , this should not de@@ tract from our oblig@@ ation to continue inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating the issue of the quality of these j@@ ob@@ s , including the rights and benefits that workers en@@ jo@@ y . 
sharing the benefits of growth should also include acceler@@ ated implementation of affir@@ m@@ ative action , including bro@@ ad@@ -@@ based black economic em@@ powerment . 
this is not in p@@ urs@@ uit of a so@@ -@@ called ra@@ cial ag@@ end@@ a . 
in re@@ ality , a country that does not ensure the invol@@ vement of all of its pop@@ ulation at all levels of economic activ@@ ity is cer@@ tain@@ ly going to perform well below its ac@@ tual potential . 
the f@@ act that the private sector lag@@ s be@@ hin@@ d in chan@@ ging the demo@@ graph@@ ics of management and sk@@ il@@ led occ@@ up@@ ations , in enter@@ prise development and so on in part mak@@ es our country a lag@@ g@@ ard in the high growth st@@ ak@@ es . 
sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and eq@@ uitable role for the state in using the fis@@ c@@ us as an instru@@ ment of re@@ distribu@@ tion and sharing the bur@@ den of providing public goods . 
hon@@ our@@ able members will be famili@@ ar with most of the data on matters relating to the social w@@ age . 
i will ho@@ we@@ ver ci@@ te a few in@@ stan@@ ces ag@@ ain to sk@@ et@@ ch out the nature of the progres@@ s we have made and the chall@@ eng@@ es that we fac@@ e . 
we have in the p@@ ast 15 years done our best to att@@ ac@@ k this s@@ cour@@ ge through the social w@@ age . 
to qu@@ o@@ te work conduc@@ ted by a te@@ am of ac@@ ade@@ mic@@ s at the uni@@ versity of stell@@ enbos@@ ch , led by pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or serv@@ aa@@ s van der berg : 
fir@@ st@@ ly , mon@@ e@@ y-@@ me@@ tric p@@ over@@ ty dec@@ lin@@ ed substan@@ ti@@ ally sin@@ ce the tur@@ n of the c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y . 
the re@@ duction is to a lar@@ ge extent due to a dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c exp@@ an@@ sion in social gr@@ ants exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture from 2002 on@@ wards . 
thir@@ d@@ ly , the d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics under@@ ly@@ ing the p@@ over@@ ty and in@@ equ@@ ality tr@@ ends determine the bro@@ ad policy out@@ l@@ ook p@@ over@@ ty has de@@ cre@@ ased sin@@ ce the tran@@ si@@ tion , but in@@ equ@@ ality has not impro@@ ved . 
on a cri@@ tical matter of det@@ ail , the res@@ earch@@ ers further ob@@ serve : 
the pre@@ val@@ ence of h@@ un@@ ger among children has vir@@ tu@@ ally hal@@ ved over four years . 
in@@ de@@ ed , these ob@@ serv@@ ations are confir@@ med by our own research , which sho@@ ws that income p@@ over@@ ty especially among african and col@@ ou@@ red communities has dec@@ lin@@ ed , part@@ ly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social gr@@ ants . 
while the number of grant benef@@ ici@@ aries was 2,@@ 5-@@ million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increas@@ ed to 12@@ ,@@ 4-@@ million . 
this is lar@@ gel@@ y a result of m@@ assi@@ ve exp@@ an@@ sion in access to the child support grant , which increas@@ ed from 34@@ -@@ th@@ ous@@ and benef@@ ici@@ aries in 1999 to 8@@ ,@@ 1-@@ million in 2008 . 
as part of the contribu@@ tion to the income of the poor , the tar@@ get for 1-@@ million work opportunities through the exp@@ an@@ ded public works programme was at@@ tained in 2008 , a year ear@@ lier than envisaged in the 2004 elec@@ toral mand@@ ate . 
this has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibi@@ lity m@@ assi@@ vely to exp@@ and this programme and improve its quality . 
with regard to hou@@ se@@ hold access to basic services , the fi@@ g@@ ures spe@@ ak for them@@ sel@@ ves . 
evidence of the social w@@ age is also se@@ en in m@@ assi@@ ve impro@@ ve@@ ments in access to primary health facilities . 
child immunis@@ ation cover@@ age has ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly increas@@ ed to about 85 ; 
we are also he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed that research into hi@@ v pre@@ val@@ ence de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates st@@ abi@@ lis@@ ation and a s@@ light re@@ duction in rates of infec@@ tion . 
y@@ et many health facilities do not al@@ ways have the required medic@@ ines , appropriate st@@ aff@@ ing levels , and con@@ st@@ ant supp@@ ly of basic services such as c@@ le@@ an r@@ un@@ ning water and elec@@ tricity . 
in some of these facilities , management is poor and staff at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des need impro@@ vement . 
in education , we have se@@ en a dro@@ p in the educ@@ ator : lear@@ ner r@@ ati@@ o ; 
at the same time , much ef@@ for@@ t has been put into impro@@ ving infrastructure in poor areas . 
of course we do know that the dro@@ p@@ out rate particul@@ arly at sec@@ ondary and tertiary levels is un@@ accep@@ tab@@ ly high , and the educ@@ ational system has y@@ et to produce the requi@@ site kin@@ ds of skills nee@@ ded by soci@@ ety . 
in addi@@ tion , tr@@ ends in performance , both in terms of teach@@ ing and learning , s@@ how a wor@@ ry@@ ing per@@ si@@ st@@ ence of the social di@@ visi@@ ons of the p@@ ast . 
ir@@ on@@ ically , prec@@ is@@ ely where education is most nee@@ ded to help bre@@ ak the c@@ yc@@ le of p@@ over@@ ty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teach@@ er capacity are least im@@ pres@@ sive . 
govern@@ ments social programmes have also impro@@ ved the ass@@ et b@@ ase of the poor , in the form of housing â with 2,@@ 6-@@ million subsi@@ dis@@ ed hou@@ ses provided . 
we should of course ac@@ knowledge that the land re@@ distribu@@ tion programme as well as post@@ -@@ sett@@ lement support could have been hand@@ led f@@ aster and better . 
over@@ all , we are pro@@ u@@ d of the advan@@ ces in our social programmes . 
but we cannot s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy our@@ sel@@ ves mer@@ ely with quanti@@ t@@ ative change . 
be it in education , health , housing , water or sanit@@ ation , the c@@ entral ques@@ tion that conf@@ ron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
on this we still have some way to go . 
the s@@ cour@@ ge of crime remain@@ s a maj@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of in@@ security for south afric@@ ans . 
da@@ ily experi@@ ence , in poor and aff@@ lu@@ ent n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds a@@ like , is one of app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion at the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of viol@@ ent att@@ ac@@ k . 
within public and private institutions , the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of ne@@ f@@ ari@@ ous schem@@ es si@@ ph@@ on@@ ing off resources through cor@@ ruption is al@@ ways a s@@ our@@ ce of gre@@ at concer@@ n 
of course , the over@@ all crime rate , having pe@@ ak@@ ed in 2002 , has consist@@ ently dec@@ lin@@ ed . 
all kin@@ ds of statisti@@ cs can be ci@@ ted to att@@ est to this . 
but we do know that the re@@ duction has not been f@@ ast en@@ ough , not even at the 7-@@ 10 rate that we set our@@ sel@@ ves for various categories of contact crime . 
this poin@@ ts to we@@ ak@@ nesses in our n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , especially in building the b@@ onds of community soli@@ d@@ ar@@ ity that would assist us in preven@@ ting and com@@ b@@ ating crime . 
it poin@@ ts to we@@ ak@@ nesses in the eff@@ ici@@ ency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
these are the issues that the com@@ prehensive re@@ v@@ amp of the criminal justice system has star@@ ted to address . 
y@@ et , in being bru@@ t@@ ally self@@ -@@ cri@@ tical , we should not lo@@ se si@@ ght of the f@@ act that what we are assess@@ ing is a system that en@@ jo@@ ys , by f@@ ar , better leg@@ iti@@ m@@ acy than ever experi@@ enc@@ ed in our country . 
this is because of the trans@@ formation these institutions have under@@ g@@ one , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights culture , their demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c com@@ position , and their systems of accoun@@ t@@ ability . 
but let us not del@@ u@@ de our@@ sel@@ ves : as with the rest of our social life , such trans@@ formation is still at its n@@ as@@ cent st@@ ages . 
we still have a long way to go . 
i am certain that hon@@ our@@ able members will ag@@ ree that the h@@ um@@ an@@ ity of our demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c disp@@ ensation should find ex@@ pres@@ sion in the extent to which we pay atten@@ tion to the most vul@@ ner@@ able in soci@@ ety . 
in this regard , we have through legislation , international con@@ ven@@ tions , regulations and c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s ens@@ ured that con@@ cre@@ te ef@@ for@@ ts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with dis@@ ability and the el@@ der@@ ly . 
through ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s and in@@ de@@ ed as a result of the part@@ nershi@@ ps we have buil@@ t with organisations repres@@ enting these vul@@ ner@@ able group@@ s , we have impro@@ ved awareness around issues that affec@@ t them ; 
it is a matter of pro@@ u@@ d record that , for in@@ stance , f@@ em@@ al@@ e-@@ he@@ a@@ ded hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds have received a bi@@ g@@ ger@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ a@@ ver@@ age share of the social w@@ age including housing and health care ; 
y@@ et access to employment w@@ eigh@@ s he@@ avi@@ ly on rural women , youth and people with dis@@ ability . 
hi@@ v imp@@ acts most se@@ ver@@ ely on young women . 
viol@@ ence against women and children is much to@@ o high . 
all these are assi@@ gn@@ ments for the com@@ ing period . 
m@@ ad@@ ame speaker and hon@@ our@@ able chair@@ person ; 
there is no g@@ ain@@ sa@@ ying that , by any meas@@ ure , the progres@@ s made sin@@ ce 1994 has been im@@ pres@@ sive . 
but n@@ either can there be d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the chall@@ eng@@ es remain im@@ mense . 
it is ap@@ t therefore to re@@ min@@ d our@@ sel@@ ves of that in@@ struc@@ tive ob@@ serv@@ ation of h@@ ope and res@@ ili@@ ence , continu@@ ity and change , by form@@ er president nel@@ s@@ on mand@@ ela , in his bio@@ grap@@ hy , long w@@ alk to fre@@ edom : 
i have w@@ alk@@ ed that long road to fre@@ edom . 
i have made mis@@ ste@@ ps al@@ ong the way . 
but i have dis@@ cover@@ ed the sec@@ re@@ t that after cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing a gre@@ at h@@ ill , one only fin@@ ds that there are many more h@@ ills to cli@@ m@@ b . 
i have taken a mo@@ ment here to rest , to ste@@ al a view of the g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous vis@@ ta that sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds me , to l@@ ook back on the di@@ stance i have come . 
but i can rest only for a mo@@ ment , for with fre@@ edom comes responsibi@@ lities , and i d@@ are not ling@@ er , for my long w@@ alk is not y@@ et en@@ ded . 
in a few months from now the people of our country will pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce on the lea@@ ders@@ hip they pre@@ fer to car@@ ry for@@ ward the no@@ ble work of this gre@@ at fre@@ edom fi@@ gh@@ ter and other f@@ oun@@ ders of our demo@@ cracy . 
while our appro@@ ach@@ es may di@@ ff@@ er , the objec@@ tives that we need to aim for are clear@@ ly and un@@ am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ously set out in our constitution : to create a uni@@ ted , non@@ ra@@ cial , non@@ s@@ exis@@ t , demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c and pro@@ sper@@ ous soci@@ ety that pla@@ ys a positive role in building a better world . 
six years ag@@ o , lea@@ ders of our people c@@ ame together in a growth and development sum@@ mit and re@@ ached agreement on the ta@@ sk@@ s all of us should under@@ take to improve the quality of life of south afric@@ ans , particul@@ arly to hal@@ ve un@@ employment and p@@ over@@ ty by 201@@ 4 . 
i am certain , that , as part of and in addi@@ tion to , these objec@@ tives south afric@@ ans would har@@ d@@ ly di@@ ff@@ er regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
i ci@@ te these issues not because they are all@@ -@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing n@@ or that by identi@@ f@@ ying them we would c@@ ure all the ills of our soci@@ ety . 
ra@@ ther , i have ch@@ os@@ en to do so to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se the poin@@ t that south africa does not suff@@ er the p@@ over@@ ty of visi@@ ons . 
our chall@@ en@@ ge is to trans@@ late these visi@@ ons into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
these ide@@ als are shar@@ ed by vir@@ tu@@ ally all of h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , as reflec@@ ted in the uni@@ ted n@@ ations m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um development go@@ als . 
and y@@ et h@@ um@@ an@@ ity to@@ day fac@@ es the d@@ ang@@ er that the at@@ tain@@ ment of these objec@@ tives could be post@@ pon@@ ed by many years , if not dec@@ ades , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of the economic cri@@ sis that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the glob@@ al vil@@ la@@ ge . 
what , on the sur@@ fac@@ e , star@@ ted off as a financial cri@@ sis among a few len@@ ding institutions has ex@@ plo@@ ded into a glob@@ al cre@@ dit cr@@ un@@ ch , with se@@ ver@@ e con@@ sequ@@ ences for ac@@ tual production and trade . 
we can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of man@@ ag@@ ers of bi@@ g corpor@@ ations which pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the cri@@ sis . 
we can con@@ de@@ m@@ n the policies of govern@@ ments which took their e@@ y@@ es off the b@@ all and allow@@ ed the rap@@ aci@@ ous licence of un@@ regula@@ ted mark@@ ets to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on financial systems . 
y@@ et our c@@ entral and immedi@@ ate t@@ ask is fully to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the con@@ sequ@@ ences of these develop@@ ments on our own econ@@ omy and our reg@@ ion , and de@@ v@@ ise respon@@ ses that will minim@@ ise their impact especially on the most vul@@ ner@@ able sec@@ tors of our soci@@ ety . 
what we do know is that the regula@@ tory environment in our country and the coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ yc@@ lic@@ al bud@@ get policies we adopted have hel@@ p@@ ed us a@@ vo@@ id the wor@@ st impact of the cri@@ sis . 
but we are all to@@ o aw@@ are that , because we are str@@ ong@@ ly integrated into the world econ@@ omy , de@@ m@@ and for our ex@@ ports has dec@@ lin@@ ed ; 
these diffic@@ ul@@ ties have co@@ in@@ ci@@ ded with a period in which inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates are still to@@ o high . 
com@@ bin@@ ed , these develop@@ ments bo@@ de ill for the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es we need to exp@@ and the provision of services and to imple@@ ment our infrastructure projects . 
as such , we have been for@@ ced to t@@ one down our for@@ ec@@ ast@@ s in terms of growth and j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
we know to@@ o that south africa is less se@@ ver@@ ely affected than many other countries . 
in@@ de@@ ed , in a period in which oth@@ ers are experi@@ enc@@ ing or projec@@ ting rec@@ es@@ sions , south africa and the rest of the contin@@ ent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a s@@ low@@ er rate . 
in this regard , hon@@ our@@ able members , i am happ@@ y to report that in the inter@@ ac@@ tions between the presid@@ ency and lea@@ ders of various social part@@ ners , we agre@@ ed jo@@ in@@ tly to de@@ v@@ ise inter@@ ven@@ tions that would minim@@ ise the impact of this cri@@ sis on our soci@@ ety . 
fir@@ st@@ ly , government will continue with its public inves@@ tment projects , the value of which has increas@@ ed to r@@ 69@@ 0@@ -@@ b@@ illi@@ on for the next three years . 
in this regard , where necessary , we will find cre@@ ative ways to ra@@ ise fun@@ ds . 
this will include support by our development fin@@ ance institutions and lo@@ an fin@@ ance from international ag@@ en@@ cies , as well as part@@ nership with the private sector and u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation of resources controlled by workers such as pen@@ sion fun@@ ds . 
sec@@ ond@@ ly , we will inten@@ si@@ fy public sector employment programmes . 
on the one hand , plan@@ s to exp@@ and employment in sec@@ tors such as health , social work , education and law@@ -@@ en@@ for@@ cement ag@@ en@@ cies will continue . 
on the other , we will spe@@ ed up the intro@@ duction of the next phase of the exp@@ an@@ ded public works programme . 
thir@@ d@@ ly , mi@@ tig@@ ating ac@@ tions can be under@@ taken within the private sector to coun@@ ter@@ act an ex@@ ces@@ sive inves@@ tment s@@ low@@ down and un@@ necessary clo@@ su@@ res of production lin@@ es or plan@@ ts . 
on its part , government will ad@@ ap@@ t indus@@ trial fin@@ anc@@ ing and inc@@ enti@@ ve instru@@ ments to help deal with chall@@ eng@@ es in various sec@@ tors , and also encour@@ age development fin@@ ance institutions to assist fir@@ ms in distr@@ ess because of the cri@@ sis . 
altern@@ atives to la@@ y@@ off@@ s will be ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ed , including longer ho@@ li@@ days , exten@@ ded training , sh@@ ort time and j@@ ob@@ -sharing . 
this will be com@@ bin@@ ed with promotion of the pro@@ ud@@ ly south africa c@@ ampaign and str@@ on@@ ger action on il@@ legal im@@ ports . 
f@@ our@@ th@@ ly , government will su@@ st@@ ain and exp@@ and social exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture , including progres@@ si@@ vely exten@@ ding access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and re@@ duc@@ ing the age of e@@ lig@@ i@@ bility for old age pen@@ sion to 60 years for m@@ en . 
in addi@@ tion , we will more wid@@ ely u@@ ti@@ li@@ se the social distr@@ ess re@@ li@@ ef grant and food security measures speci@@ fic@@ ally also to tar@@ get those either un@@ protec@@ ted by the un@@ employment ins@@ ur@@ ance fund or who have ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted their benefits . 
we shall also continue to pay special atten@@ tion to the chall@@ en@@ ge of anti@@ competi@@ tive be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our on the part of some of our corpor@@ ations . 
in this regard , we wish to com@@ men@@ d the competi@@ tion commission for the fir@@ m hand that they are sho@@ wing to ensure that cul@@ pr@@ its are b@@ rou@@ ght to b@@ ook . 
we do h@@ ope th@@ ough that civil soci@@ ety will en@@ h@@ ance its own level of acti@@ vis@@ m to ensure , among other th@@ ings , that as in@@ put p@@ ric@@ es dec@@ line , the benefit is f@@ el@@ t by the pop@@ ulation . 
these immedi@@ ate measures will be inform@@ ed by the prin@@ cip@@ le of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ yc@@ lic@@ al fis@@ cal policy . 
ho@@ we@@ ver , we will ensure that the levels of bor@@ ro@@ wing by government are pr@@ ud@@ ent and sustainable . 
this also imp@@ lies a rap@@ id re@@ duction in government deb@@ t levels wh@@ en@@ ever conditions tur@@ n for the better . 
our ef@@ for@@ ts will also be inform@@ ed by the app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation that measures to protect the environment and mi@@ tig@@ ate the impact of cli@@ mate change can also contribu@@ te to j@@ ob@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
both in the g@@ 20 me@@ et@@ ings and other inter@@ ac@@ tions in multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al institutions , our government has ar@@ gu@@ ed for appropriate and ur@@ g@@ ent inter@@ ven@@ tions particul@@ arly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the cri@@ sis origin@@ ated and where it is most se@@ ver@@ e . 
cri@@ tic@@ ally , we should also saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the integr@@ ity of the world trade system , complete the current neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the do@@ ha ro@@ un@@ d of world trade neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , and ensure that development aid is not s@@ cal@@ ed down . 
in our own country , we will emb@@ ar@@ k on these under@@ tak@@ ings as part of the process of s@@ etting our soci@@ ety on a higher growth and development p@@ ath . 
the l@@ eng@@ th of time towards at@@ taining a higher tra@@ jec@@ tory may have been st@@ ret@@ ch@@ ed some@@ what . 
but we are not in d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that that mo@@ ment will y@@ et come so@@ on@@ er ra@@ ther than later . 
in this regard , how we position our country to take advan@@ t@@ age of uni@@ qu@@ e opportunities that have come our way , will be of par@@ amount import@@ ance . 
i ref@@ er here in particular to the fi@@ f@@ a world cu@@ p in 2010 as well as the con@@ fe@@ der@@ ations cu@@ p a few months from now . 
vir@@ tu@@ ally all the projects and plan@@ s are completed or ne@@ aring comple@@ tion â from sta@@ di@@ a , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommod@@ ation , to health and im@@ migr@@ ation plan@@ s â confir@@ ming the conf@@ id@@ ence of the glob@@ al so@@ cc@@ er f@@ ra@@ ternity that ours will be a tr@@ uly success@@ ful t@@ our@@ na@@ ment . 
and we be@@ li@@ eve that , after five con@@ secu@@ tive win@@ s , the national so@@ cc@@ er te@@ am is now more conf@@ id@@ ently ge@@ aring it@@ self to perform above exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations ! 
but be@@ y@@ ond this , the tr@@ ue leg@@ acy of this spec@@ t@@ ac@@ le will be in our ability to sho@@ wc@@ ase south african and african hospit@@ ality and h@@ um@@ an@@ ity â to change once and for all per@@ c@@ ep@@ tions of our country and our contin@@ ent among pe@@ opl@@ es of the world . 
we also wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te all our spor@@ ting te@@ ams which have ass@@ er@@ ted south afric@@ as p@@ urs@@ uit of exc@@ ell@@ ence over the p@@ ast year . 
special ac@@ co@@ la@@ des are due to our c@@ ric@@ k@@ et te@@ am which has cli@@ m@@ bed to the ap@@ e@@ x of glob@@ al rank@@ ings . 
we are of course rug@@ by world ch@@ amp@@ i@@ ons ; 
gin@@ i@@ el de vil@@ li@@ ers and his te@@ am have w@@ on the d@@ ak@@ ar r@@ ally ; 
our par@@ al@@ y@@ mp@@ i@@ ans continue to do us pro@@ u@@ d ; 
j@@ ust two weeks ag@@ o , south africa completed with mal@@ i part of the ar@@ chi@@ ves to pres@@ erve the an@@ ci@@ ent man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of ti@@ m@@ bu@@ k@@ t@@ u . 
this ric@@ h heritage poin@@ ts to africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of sci@@ ence and liter@@ ature , ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy and comm@@ er@@ ce , inter@@ rup@@ ted by the sla@@ ve trade and the s@@ cr@@ am@@ ble for afric@@ as we@@ alth . 
this initi@@ ative should sp@@ ur us on to act in concer@@ t with other countries on our contin@@ ent and further af@@ i@@ eld to better the human condi@@ tion . 
in@@ de@@ ed , over the p@@ ast 15 years we have s@@ par@@ ed no ef@@ for@@ t to ensure that africa experi@@ ences her renew@@ al in what should in ac@@ tual practice be the african c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y . 
it is this , and this al@@ one , that has inform@@ ed our per@@ si@@ st@@ ence in assi@@ sting the people of z@@ im@@ bab@@ we to find a la@@ sting so@@ lution to the cri@@ sis in that country . 
we wish in this regard to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te all the parties in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we for conclu@@ ding neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , deliver@@ ing the ulti@@ mate pri@@ z@@ e that has al@@ ways been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ contin@@ ent as a who@@ le : that is , a st@@ able and leg@@ iti@@ mate government ge@@ ar@@ ed to address the chall@@ eng@@ es that the people fac@@ e . 
we are tr@@ uly he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed that , y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , the z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an parliament passed amendment 19 of the constitution , la@@ ying the basis for the inst@@ all@@ ation of an inclu@@ sive government . 
special men@@ tion in this regard is due to s@@ ad@@ c facilit@@ ator , form@@ er president th@@ ab@@ o m@@ bek@@ i and the te@@ am that ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly and pati@@ ently hel@@ p@@ ed to bring the process to a success@@ ful conclu@@ sion . 
in this respect , there is ur@@ g@@ ent need to assist in de@@ aling with the h@@ um@@ anit@@ ari@@ an cri@@ sis in that country . 
we are conf@@ ident that , because it car@@ es , the international community will part@@ ner the people of z@@ im@@ bab@@ we as they bla@@ z@@ e out al@@ ong a new tr@@ ail . 
we are also encour@@ aged that , wh@@ ate@@ ver f@@ its and star@@ ts may se@@ em to character@@ ise the progres@@ s of the people of the demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c republic of con@@ go on their mar@@ ch to st@@ ability and pro@@ sper@@ ity , that progres@@ s is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able . 
the part@@ nership buil@@ t in the rec@@ ent period between the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the dr@@ c and r@@ w@@ and@@ a hol@@ ds out a pro@@ mis@@ e for advan@@ ces in matters of security and in de@@ aling with the h@@ um@@ anit@@ ari@@ an cri@@ sis ; 
in the same meas@@ ure , we will continue to work with other countries and the african uni@@ on to pur@@ su@@ e these objec@@ tives in bur@@ un@@ d@@ i , su@@ dan , wes@@ tern sa@@ har@@ a , c@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te di@@ vo@@ i@@ re , s@@ om@@ ali@@ a and el@@ se@@ where . 
as would have been evid@@ enc@@ ed by various develop@@ ments in the p@@ ast few months , south africa will use the pri@@ vi@@ lege of chair@@ ing s@@ ad@@ c to streng@@ then this cri@@ tical regional institution , with particular em@@ ph@@ asis on implementing sum@@ mit resol@@ u@@ tions and ce@@ men@@ ting regional strategi@@ c co@@ h@@ esi@@ on . 
we will as al@@ ways se@@ ek to streng@@ then coo@@ per@@ ation with these and other countries in p@@ urs@@ uit of that which is good for h@@ um@@ an@@ ity . 
we are pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged that this year we conclu@@ de c@@ ele@@ br@@ ations of the first dec@@ ade of our dipl@@ omati@@ c relations with the pe@@ opl@@ es republic of ch@@ ina . 
over these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mu@@ tual benefit to be g@@ ain@@ ed from our part@@ nership . 
we also wish to affir@@ m our commit@@ ment to the close relations that we have for@@ ged with br@@ az@@ il and indi@@ a through i@@ b@@ sa ; 
and in@@ de@@ ed to the streng@@ th@@ ening b@@ onds that our country has been for@@ ging with r@@ us@@ si@@ a , and countries in asi@@ a , the mid@@ d@@ le e@@ ast , as well as l@@ ati@@ n and nor@@ th am@@ er@@ ic@@ a .

there can be no j@@ usti@@ fication for such acts of wan@@ ton des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion and sav@@ ag@@ er@@ y .

we were able in the p@@ ast year to conclu@@ de further neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with the e@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an uni@@ on on our strategi@@ c part@@ nership ;

we l@@ ook for@@ ward to further streng@@ th@@ ening this part@@ nership when we ho@@ st the south afric@@ a-@@ e@@ u sum@@ mit later this year . 
al@@ ong with other countries of the south we will continue to pur@@ su@@ e the c@@ ause of the res@@ tr@@ uc@@ t@@ uring of the uni@@ ted n@@ ations , the international mon@@ et@@ ary fund and other multi@@ la@@ ter@@ al institutions so they reflec@@ t the chan@@ ged and chan@@ ging glob@@ al re@@ ality and oper@@ ate in a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , eq@@ uitable and trans@@ parent manner . 
we also comm@@ it our@@ sel@@ ves to meet the objec@@ tives of international agreements , including the k@@ y@@ o@@ to pro@@ to@@ co@@ l and its success@@ ors for the benefit of fu@@ ture gener@@ ations among our own people and pe@@ opl@@ es of the world . 
inform@@ ing these our en@@ de@@ av@@ ours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mand@@ ate accor@@ ded this government in 2004 ; 
in the com@@ ing few months pen@@ ding the national and provincial elec@@ tions , we will en@@ de@@ av@@ our to complete that pop@@ ula@@ r mand@@ ate . 
as part of the many det@@ ailed projects contain@@ ed in the govern@@ ments programme of action , we will pay particular atten@@ tion to :
