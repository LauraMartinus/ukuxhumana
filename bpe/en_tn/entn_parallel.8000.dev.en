Other global factors that must be considered are :
There is a very important question that we asked ourselves in 1994 .

Some of the high@@ li@@ ghts of these inter@@ actions include the following :

Per@@ formance at the lower levels has an impact at the higher levels .
This experience confir@@ ms that we are developing day by day .
But , la@@ dies and gen@@ tl@@ em@@ en , the ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ation process remains a re@@ active measure .

In this context , our achiev@@ ements are all the more mean@@ ing@@ ful :

All right how are you ?

S@@ c@@ ope of Fin@@ ancing
We know that we can rel@@ y on you as partners on this no@@ ble jour@@ ney .
Se@@ ver@@ al factors see@@ m to explain this fact :
Pa@@ y@@ ments must be related to costs .
R@@ ape is , however , not the only crime in the province .

It shall also take into consideration the needs of countries in post-@@ conflict situ@@ ations .
The Par@@ ties further agree to streng@@ then their co@@ operation in this field .

This process created a bac@@ k@@ lo@@ g in the number of fi@@ re@@ ar@@ ms d@@ est@@ ro@@ yed .
There are broad@@ er social responsibilities .
We will attend to this matter in a bal@@ anced and dig@@ ni@@ fied way .

I take this as a mess@@ age of hope for older gener@@ ations .
L@@ et us go back to bas@@ ics ; your child is my child .

The new plan focu@@ ses on :
Some of us may start as@@ king this question .
On@@ ly the one paragraph .
This project should be received and accep@@ ted by the community .
The tasks will , however , not be re-@@ asse@@ ssed .
If we are serious , then I think we must address this question properly .
Access areas must be adequ@@ ately li@@ t .

As already mentioned , the construction of the D@@ e Ho@@ o@@ p D@@ am is proc@@ e@@ eding well .
Provincial health plans must con@@ form with national health policy .
The op@@ ening of the d@@ rain should be covered with this objec@@ t .

This is a mark@@ ed improvement on the position we were in a dec@@ ad@@ e ago .
In@@ cre@@ ase in crime rate .
Ther@@ efore , we would like to know from the Minister when these fin@@ dings would be rel@@ eased .
In the sp@@ iri@@ t of the New P@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ tis@@ m , we can only r@@ ise to new he@@ i@@ ghts .
This is a great achievement , but more import@@ an@@ tly it is f@@ illing an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ga@@ p .
C@@ an you give us a h@@ int ?
Inter@@ view people to investi@@ gate the problem .
B@@ ec@@ ause it is v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able , it must be def@@ ended and streng@@ th@@ ened .
It also changes the way we speak and think , or structure our experience .
It is be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful to look at !
De@@ mocr@@ acy is hard work .
The model has the following character@@ istics :

They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in har@@ mon@@ y with nature .
In fo@@ c@@ using our min@@ ds , we always need to ask : What is our strategic objective ?
L@@ et us pul@@ l together , and in the same direc@@ tion .
What is the state of discussion if there is any ?
I would like to beg@@ in by deal@@ ing with the African issues :
The following information should be included in the letter , among others :
There is an ac@@ ute shor@@ t@@ age of skills and un@@ employment is ri@@ fe .
The face of HIV and AIDS in South Africa has become even more complex .

It was a sign that we did not want to use these in@@ human@@ e bu@@ ck@@ ets .
And most import@@ an@@ tly , awards re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ents .
The management is ur@@ ged to rec@@ tify staff shor@@ t@@ ages as a matter of ur@@ gency .
This testing fac@@ ility en@@ comp@@ as@@ ses all three of these areas .
But we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ 't want to have it any other way .
We are also addres@@ sing other forms of dis@@ advantage .
L@@ uc@@ k@@ ily for him , he was fam@@ ili@@ ar with the farm and fel@@ t his way through .

This represen@@ ts an increase of 20@@ 7@@ 6 members .
Community participation involves far more than consultation .
The ag@@ ency has also developed and approved a f@@ ra@@ ud pre@@ vention policy .

It bas@@ ically means that there should be communication and consultation .
The meeting no@@ ted that the youth con@@ stitute the majority of the po@@ or@@ est and the un@@ employed .

There are two areas that give r@@ ise to concern .

We have been together on this jour@@ ney for little over a year .
With regard to the economic ones , there is ur@@ gency .
And there are pl@@ en@@ ty of opportunities .
Per@@ form a dr@@ illing investi@@ gation based on the assessment .
As I said ear@@ li@@ er , even in our political parties you will en@@ coun@@ ter this problem .
N@@ ame the following processes :

S@@ elec@@ t and care for workshop equipment applicable to the task .
I want people to feel com@@ for@@ table around me .
This document will be b@@ rought to the attention of Parliament in due course .
The results are not signific@@ an@@ tly different across mo@@ d@@ els .
We are , as you also re@@ min@@ ded us , Mr President , an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary people .
The qu@@ al@@ it@@ atively new areas of focus , which include :
N@@ ot@@ with@@ standing the various initiatives that have been implemented , the security of government remains in@@ adequate .
The most outs@@ tanding example of this of course is the aut@@ om@@ ob@@ ile industry .
W@@ r@@ ite only the seven questions in your answer book .

The inc@@ en@@ tives provided .
We know that there are more g@@ ir@@ ls than bo@@ ys in our schools .
They si@@ t at the very top of the p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id@@ .
And that is one of the opportunities .
L@@ et us do so .
Cri@@ me and violence
One must be a speci@@ alist in the particular field .
H@@ ere , too , South Africa has much to offer .
L@@ et@@ 's de@@ ep@@ en the fi@@ ght against these mon@@ st@@ rou@@ s and bar@@ bar@@ ic acts .
And that has created a c@@ ou@@ ple of h@@ und@@ red jobs per municipality .
I thought up some ideas this mor@@ ning .
For some reason the response was not as expected .
The programme will be presented over the following peri@@ ods :
In the light of these develop@@ ments , inf@@ lation expec@@ tations have deter@@ i@@ or@@ ated .

But let me end where I started .
They will act to sol@@ ve these problems .
Municipal sph@@ ere of government .
Str@@ ong uni@@ ons are not only a sign of a healthy democracy .
Our focus is actu@@ ally to make sure that we improve service delivery .
En@@ han@@ c@@ ement of regul@@ ation , super@@ vision and inv@@ es@@ tor protection .
This is especially true in a new system such as ours .
S@@ peci@@ alised fields should be interpre@@ ted as broad@@ ly as possible .
I acc@@ ept that claim .
The reason for this is that FI@@ F@@ I Bank has a cash flow problem .
H@@ ap@@ p@@ ily , the O@@ A@@ U is activ@@ ely addres@@ sing this issue of pe@@ ace and st@@ ability on our continent .
We@@ '@@ ve not said do one and then the other .
T@@ hat is the state of play as far as that issue is concerned .
We should be more reasonable and not act in a way that ex@@ ac@@ er@@ ba@@ tes the situation .
T@@ og@@ e@@ ther we have long dre@@ am@@ t of the African R@@ ena@@ is@@ s@@ ance , whose time has come .
P@@ over@@ ty however , contin@@ ues to pose a challenge on our way to achieve that vision .

The approach to practical art should :
As a government , we con@@ dem@@ n and fi@@ ght crime to the best of our ability .
There will now be a sound basis to stop those viol@@ ations from happen@@ ing .
If not , get your school to develop one .
Fin@@ ally , we have to think of nation building .

It must include the objectives of job creation and poverty re@@ duction .
I do not believe we are over@@ ly sen@@ si@@ tive .
Sec@@ urity needs to be improved on the farm .
A multi@@ purpose centre will be han@@ ded over to the community .
So , what is the role of the journ@@ alist in all this ?
These have all played an important part .
These are un@@ limited resources for teaching and learning .
But it is just that : a foun@@ dation .
T@@ hat this is in fact essential for the achievement of non-@@ rac@@ i@@ alism .

What is it about ?
Water is life !
T@@ om@@ or@@ row , on Africa Day , the d@@ ream of I@@ ng@@ ri@@ d J@@ on@@ k@@ er will come to fru@@ i@@ tion .

And it can bl@@ ank@@ et far more than the par@@ k .
A registration certificate may not be trans@@ ferred .
The la@@ test research on the extent of violence in specific countries will be rel@@ eased .
This country , and in@@ deed this c@@ ity , pla@@ ys a central role in this system of multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alis@@ m@@ .

The deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation of the health system is a case in point .

No@@ w is the time to act .
We still believe that the U@@ N is the key multi@@ lat@@ er@@ al institution for global governance .
Pol@@ iti@@ cal processes have been de@@ plo@@ yed in order to resol@@ ve the situation .
It is im@@ possible , within the sc@@ ope of this report , to men@@ tion all contri@@ but@@ ors .

B@@ esid@@ es these matters I have just mentioned , the following will also be addressed :
People of the C@@ ity
The first part of the process involved the development of the policy context .
As required , the President appointed f@@ our@@ te@@ en Members of the Commission .
So where is the great des@@ tin@@ ation ?
These are not comm@@ it@@ ments that can be met without some har@@ d@@ ship .
We have been able to increase our sc@@ ope and mag@@ nit@@ ud@@ e of international inter@@ action .
Social gr@@ ants for children , old and dis@@ abled .
The history of all our people is important .
The first person to be sho@@ t , however , was the farm@@ er's wi@@ fe .

To@@ day we have come to say a big than@@ k you to all of you .
Po@@ si@@ tive develop@@ ments are ev@@ id@@ ent in our economy .
A manual for the sof@@ tw@@ are must also be available .
What are the issues that you would like to re@@ ve@@ al ?
The first answer is given in Q@@ U@@ ES@@ TION 7 .

Language in the workplace :
This must be our 2010 leg@@ acy .
I wish you all a mer@@ ry Chris@@ t@@ mas and happ@@ y pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous new year .
Su@@ ch development will not be possible without the effective de@@ plo@@ y@@ ment of information and communication technology .
I know you were a sol@@ di@@ er at the time .
I would like to em@@ phas@@ ise that the strategy requires that we take collec@@ tive ownership .
The purpose and nature of rules of succ@@ ession .
As many as I lik@@ ed .
Pro@@ gress will be reported on a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly basis .
So far we have worked with 2 concepts :
Members of the Council for N@@ atural Sci@@ enti@@ fic Prof@@ es@@ sions ;
The In@@ ko@@ mat@@ i C@@ at@@ ch@@ ment Management A@@ gency was the first to be established .
The project sp@@ ans the first three terms of the year .

The challenge of human and social d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics .
AND BE@@ AR@@ ING IN M@@ IN@@ D
Our future is greater than our past .
In a few years ' time this place will be like a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard .
Ex@@ pla@@ in the concept shap@@ e code and its purpose .
This growth rate is higher than the average national rate .
Ver@@ y few women companies can do that .
Government con@@ dem@@ ns the violence that has character@@ ised the stri@@ ke .
He said the department will be presen@@ ting it to Parliament in September .
T@@ hat br@@ ings us to the second question .
Minister means the Minister responsible for E@@ ner@@ gy ;
These ses@@ sions will reach some of the remo@@ test parts of the country .
More equ@@ itable ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hic spread of economic activity .
The@@ ir ver@@ sion of what happen@@ ed .
Tha@@ t's when I became inter@@ ested know@@ ing more about this industry .
I have seen it in the st@@ re@@ ets of K@@ ins@@ ha@@ sa , since we have ar@@ ri@@ ved y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
We ple@@ dge to do more and better with less .
And we have no dou@@ b@@ t that i@@ Them@@ ba P@@ har@@ ma@@ c@@ e@@ u@@ tic@@ als will help us r@@ ise to the occa@@ sion .
To achieve these part@@ ner@@ ships will , in@@ deed , require of us to act strateg@@ ically .
In the shor@@ t-@@ term , we are committed to ste@@ pping up service delivery in the area .
The Chairperson th@@ ank@@ ed him for his contribution to the discussion .
However , it should be no@@ ted that our trade fi@@ gu@@ res are different from the Ch@@ ine@@ se fi@@ gu@@ res .
To@@ day I am able to announ@@ ce far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing decisions in this connec@@ tion .
We reach out with you R@@ ic@@ hard .
Est@@ ab@@ lish@@ ment of the authority
This is what the team says :
Ta@@ ke them some me@@ at .

A dec@@ ad@@ e ago , it was clear what had to be done ma@@ cr@@ o econom@@ ically .
Wh@@ il@@ st development and progress is s@@ low , it is on trac@@ k .
San@@ itation for health and dig@@ nity .
W@@ ha@@ t's going to happ@@ en about that ?
This should be something we must as@@ pi@@ re to .
The deleg@@ ation must be in writing .
It can be a source of dig@@ nity and ful@@ fil@@ ment .
L@@ ack of information submitted may result in pen@@ al@@ ties being im@@ posed .
The promo@@ tion of pe@@ ace and security is one of South Africa's most important objectives .
Small countries should have appropriate vo@@ ice .
I will tal@@ k on each of these areas very bri@@ ef@@ ly .
You should also be able to state where the emer@@ gency is .
This Department plans to r@@ ise to the challenge of taking the lead in this effort .
Teach@@ ers and Rese@@ arch@@ ers
More needs to be done at the mic@@ r@@ o level .
Com@@ pare the energy value of the two bre@@ ad rol@@ ls .

The criteria for the elements for each part of the project will be set .
It cal@@ ls upon us to ab@@ and@@ on sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ness , gre@@ ed and violence .
Are there any other questions ?
In addition , women face dis@@ cri@@ mination .
T@@ el@@ l me about your fa@@ ther and your mo@@ ther , and you of course .
State what is me@@ ant by a di@@ hy@@ bri@@ d cro@@ ss .
I b@@ rought the process to this point .
It is not just about the money .
And most import@@ an@@ tly the children here with us today .
Once the claim has been pres@@ er@@ ved , the action contin@@ ues to be covered by the sta@@ y .
But that will not be enough .
Our main challenge is not so much c@@ ar ownership , but c@@ ar use .
The main changes contained in the rev@@ ised regul@@ ations are as follows :
But we also have specific less@@ on outcomes , on which we evalu@@ ate the work .
This means that about 4 , 31 million people are offic@@ i@@ ally out of work .
Ma@@ p work should be integrated with the@@ ory throughout the year .
Provinces will make all the arrang@@ ements .
Use a grap@@ h to interpre@@ t the data in the table .

It is a special job , which requires particular qu@@ alities .
In some in@@ stances , the needs of society are par@@ amount .
The Minister is responsible for providing administrative and other support services to the Council .
As you are aware , South Africa has not signed this e@@ P@@ ass .

Our main concern should be the people .
Co@@ al , water and nu@@ clear power .
And to whom I was like to give offence .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of th@@ ous@@ ands of jobs have been lost in mining and agriculture .

The them@@ e for the celebr@@ ations is :

But for the time being , ther@@ e's no common understanding of what we need .
These cri@@ mes usually occur between people who know each other .
We have made progress in re@@ ach@@ ing con@@ sen@@ su@@ s on the defin@@ i@@ tion of dis@@ ability .
This is a matter for the SAPS , pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors and the cour@@ ts .
Ma@@ x@@ imum number of members
We continue to focus on the 5 priority areas identified in the programme of government .
So I@@ '@@ m not aware of any pen@@ al@@ ties at this particular point .
Fin@@ ding the right em@@ power@@ ment part@@ ner can make all the difference .
So , let us today celebr@@ ate our li@@ ber@@ ation .
The programme has adop@@ ted the con@@ tractor approach .

Or@@ al and Pr@@ ac@@ tical :
Coun@@ selling is provided and a request form will need to be signed .

In this regard , it is probably wor@@ th@@ while for this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on to be investi@@ gated further .

G@@ ive the signific@@ ance of the pho@@ to@@ elec@@ tri@@ c effect :
As we go about these critical tasks , what is our gu@@ iding man@@ tr@@ a ?
R@@ ac@@ ing takes place in resid@@ ential areas .
We cannot continue the old way .
V@@ ari@@ ous studies have confir@@ med that there is a direct link between skills levels and employment .
Make pre@@ dic@@ tions where appropriate .
It is way over@@ due .
We already have the framework within which to do this .
The matter was set@@ tled out of court .
The propos@@ als for re@@ form f@@ all into three distin@@ c@@ t groups :
Assessment Stand@@ ards in the Programme of Assessment .
These reports shall be b@@ rought to the attention of the World Her@@ it@@ age Committee .

We shall be sup@@ por@@ tive and vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant in monitoring progress in this regard .
In other words , a certificate will be issued for each successfully completed year .
Minister B@@ alo@@ yi is atten@@ ding to this matter .
They look as if they are in a tr@@ ance - possib@@ ly standing still and sing@@ ing .
They also help us to share the sp@@ iri@@ t of the World C@@ up beyond the st@@ adi@@ um .
Ste@@ m cel@@ l research
Th@@ us far , the su@@ spec@@ ts have been lin@@ ked to 2@@ 8@@ 8 cases .
Ac@@ tiv@@ ities of the project
The research is still in its early stages .
Li@@ ke the rest of the country , Limpopo has a very high youth population .
We will look at that .
The C@@ ity has also made a commitment to funding improv@@ ements . . .
There are , of course , also less@@ ons for us as a C@@ ity in this project .
They guide us now as they gu@@ ided the great leaders of our country .

There is also the problem of a lack of an over@@ si@@ ght ag@@ ency .
Stu@@ d@@ ying late at ni@@ ght .
