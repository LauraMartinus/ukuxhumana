Using the technique described in {Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation}[https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04558], this dataset contains all of our available parallel (clean) data, along with the tag added to the beginning of the English translation.

The plan is to train the model with all the combined data, and then test on one language. I am unsure what to use for validation.
