<zu> The overwhelming success in the promotion of cooperatives and SMMEs means that our resources must be directed to support both cooperatives and SMMEs at district level . 
<zu> inter alia , a coordinated and efficiently implemented infrastructural investment programme , in which both government and the private sector will have major roles to play . 
<zu> In this regard I am also pleased to report very satisfactory progress over the last year: 
<zu> In the forthcoming MTEF , ring-fenced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job creation , poverty relief and black economic empowerment . These programmes are the following: 
<zu>  this strategy in turn is aligned to the national Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative . The rationale behind this approach is simple: 
<zu> Empowerment initiatives 
<zu> A further 5 high profile cases of fraud and corruption involving syndicates are under investigation , and we have joined forces with the Directorate of Special Operations and Asset Forfeiture Unit in order to secure successful prosecutions . 
<zu> Mr Speaker , in last years address I alluded to the fact that we will not attain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty alleviation programmes 
<zu>  the Office of the Premier will be responsible for coordinating the soccer development programme across the departments involved . 
<zu> into the second phase of development by establishing secondary and tertiary cooperatives . Eleven secondary coops will be setup in each of the district municipalities and metro , 
<zu> pre-qualified bidders that are technically , financially and legally qualified and meet the empowerment criteria , 
<zu> Such practices have to become far more efficient , ensuring that administrative delays do not place unbearable cashflow burden on the SMMEs . 
<zu> In terms of employment , according to the Stats SA Labour Force Survey , in 2004 993 ,000 people in the province were unemployed - this declined to 987 ,000 in 2005 , 
<zu> The reforms in our asset and supply chain management systems and policies are proceeding on track and are set to greatly improve efficiencies in the way we procure and account for goods and services and physical assets . 
<zu> The land at La Mercy to be sold to the province . 
<zu> World Cup stadium development 
<zu> The intention is to provide a bridging programme , a one year certificate , a two year diploma and a three year degree in cooperatives and business management practice . 
<zu> Some of the cases are before the courts of law and misconduct enquiries are also being handled by respective departments . 
<zu> Both Ithala and the Provincial Government concede that this demand for finance cannot be met by Ithala alone . 
<zu> for emerging contractors aimed at promoting and supporting affirmable business and equity in the civil and building contractor sector . It comprises a six-staged advancement programme with contract value limits determined by experience , training and capacity . 
<zu> Given the huge deal flow which the initial SMME fund managed by Ithala has already generated , the Head of Treasury was tasked to develop a scheme 
<zu> which will then enter into contractual agreements with ACSA to manage and operate the airport and with the selected bidder from the private sector to design and construct the facility . 
<zu> amounting to approximately R6bn in 2005/06 , to stimulate growth in the SMME sector and to advance black economic empowerment generally . 
<zu> POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE 2006/07 MTEF 
<zu> The focus will be on dissemination of information and giving guidance to women , youth and the disabled . 
<zu> The relocation of Durban International Airport when King Shaka International is operational in 2009 ; and 
<zu> Draft legislation establishing the DTP has been prepared and will be submitted to this Legislature in March . I appeal to Honourable Members to ensure that this Bill is dealt with within the strict timeframes we have set ourselves . 
<zu> As I mentioned , this year we will also be instituting a new co-financing model to support the growth of the small business sector in the province . 
<zu> An important part of governments infrastructure-related strategic investment programme for the medium term is the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone . 
<zu> if economic growth can be stepped up to average 4 ,5 over the next five years , and 6 from 2009 to 2014 , then: 
<zu> to empower them so as to be capable of running viable commercial enterprises . This means that secondary coops will need to possess skills in financial management , 
<zu> We are proposing to allocate R31m , R89m and R139 ,5m over the MTEF period as a contribution to the building of soccer stadium infrastructure in the province . 
<zu> A special training unit has been created in collaboration with the University of Zululand to train managers and members of coops and to develop careers in the field . 
<zu> with the main functions of providing support to primary cooperatives , which are by design production units . The intention is to ensure that primary cooperatives get support from secondary and tertiary cooperatives , 
<zu> This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs , 
<zu> which will together with the Department of Sport and Recreation play a coordinating role in assisting the District Municipalities of Amajuba , Ugu , uMgungundlovu and uThungulu 
<zu> In the area of governance and risk management , quarterly summary reports on the risk profile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet . 
<zu> A contract is being concluded with the NSIC team of consultants , who will be based in the province for 10 weeks , and who will work with a team from Treasury and Economic Development . 
<zu> marketing and general business management . For technical skills secondary coops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required expertise and for private sector wishing to do business with this sector . 
<zu> The Dube TradePort Section 21 Company will have to be converted into a statutory public entity under the PFMA that is empowered to establish King Shaka International Airport Special Purpose Vehicle , 
<zu> Against this background , what are the governments expenditure priorities for the new MTEF budget cycle commencing in six weeks? 
<zu> including the provision and loan of capital equipment , on a day to day basis and are not dependant on government support permanently . Support will be given to secondary coops 
<zu> ECONOMIC SNAPSHOT 
<zu> inter alia through the bargaining muscle it will acquire over the control of resources and markets through the sheer scale of its operations , with benefits flowing to members of the cooperatives . 
<zu> The flagship Dube TradePort project incorporating a state of the art Airport in King Shaka International has made solid progress and we are on track to achieve our deadline for the project to be operational by 2009 . 
<zu> Our quest to narrow the gap between the first and second economies will continue to be a central feature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
<zu> the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as barbed wire , ceramic tiles , agri-food products , building materials , paper products etc ; 
<zu> will deal with each of these three policy priority areas in turn . 
<zu> allowing time in the first year of the MTEF for the stakeholders to finalise the business case , funding model and ownership arrangements . 
<zu> I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term consistency in the budget policy framework and direction to achieve maximum impact over time . 
<zu> The equipment and professional expertise provided by the NSIC will be used to support the growth and development of small medium and micro enterprises in the province , including cooperatives at both the primary and secondary level . 
<zu> Co-financing strategy 
<zu> The intention 
<zu> and an electronic system to perform the acquisition stage of SCM , namely the sourcing of Quotations and Tenders  this project will both improve efficiencies and turnaround times as well as help to eliminate fraud and corruption . 
<zu> Our proposal is to set aside R20 million , R200 million and R1 ,5 billion over the 2006/07 MTEF years for this project  this is over and above the R100m already in this years budget for the Trade Port . 
<zu> I have alluded to the successes already attained in establishing primary cooperatives around the province in the last year . This year we intend to move the cooperatives programme 
<zu> But hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come  Whispering it will be happier ; 
<zu> for financing business applications from primary cooperatives will be augmented by allocations of R100m , R187m and R217m over the 2006/07 MTEF  these funds will be managed by the Department of Economic Development . 
<zu> In reviewing its policy priorities for the new MTEF period , the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the goal of placing the province on a sustainably higher growth path a central part of its economic development strategy 
<zu> In the March budget address a year ago it was emphasized that government intended to use its procurement spend on goods and services , 
<zu> As the DTP will no longer be established as a PPP , the R100m allocated to the project in this years budget will be routed via Ithala to facilitate site preparation work  including site acquisition , perimeter fencing , 
<zu> This does not mean that we will be neglecting the need for continued support for primary cooperatives . The initial allocation of R110m to Ithala in the current financial year 
<zu> This investment will stimulate economic development along these nodes and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
<zu> ACSA to acquire a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a concession within or after the 10 year term ; 
<zu> This is a significant development , as henceforth governance and risk management issues cutting across all departments will be highlighted at an executive level . 
<zu> This pressure on Ithala is a reflection that in SMME finance for the disadvantaged , Ithala is the institution of choice . 
<zu> In terms of overall economic growth , according to Stats SA KwaZulu-Natal recorded a growth rate of 4 ,9 in 2004 , second only to the Western Cape at 5 ,3 and above the national growth rate of 4 ,5 
<zu> Establishment of secondary cooperatives 
<zu> which we hope to conclude by December 2006 . Award of the contract will follow and it is expected that main construction will commence in March 2007 , with facilities to be completed and operational by October 2009 . 
<zu> But some of you might legitimately ask whether all these government interventions have had a measurable effect on improving the economic performance of the province . 
<zu> The Dube TradePort as a statutory public entity will be mandated to drive the trade zone development , the cyberport , the agricultural zone and other associated commercial developments . 
<zu> Before the end of June the Department of Economic Development will convene a conference involving representatives of all municipalities to discuss common and coordinated approach to Local Economic Development . 
<zu> We must realise that we are dooming the cooperatives and SMMEs we are establishing to failure from the outset unless we follow through by facilitating access to government procurement on a sustainable basis . 
<zu> The University of KwaZulu-Natal will also be approached on a similar basis . 
<zu> Just to what extent these impressive growth and employment figures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficult to quantify at this stage . 
<zu>  we are of the unshakeable view that 
<zu> To this end , we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year . 
<zu> Many people in the izimbizo reported delays in getting approval  this is simply due to the large volumes of applications . 
<zu> Although we have indeed made progress in addressing the central challenges of poverty , unemployment and service backlogs in the past year , much remains to be done in the short , medium and long term . 
<zu> Criminal investigations , which will eventually lead to prosecution , are being conducted by the Special Investigation Unit , a division of the National Prosecuting Authority . 
<zu> It will apply to both civil engineering works such as airports , runways , bridges , roads etc , as well as general building works . 
<zu> which has more than fifty years experience in promoting the growth of small scale industries and business enterprises . We are exploring two areas of cooperation with the NSIC: 
<zu> The SEDAs will work in collaboration with Ithala and the Department of Economic Development to provide support services at district level 
<zu> and finance , real estate and business services , which grew at 7 ,9 . The manufacturing sector grew at a healthy rate of 4 ,5 . 
<zu>  and failure to meet the deadline is not an option  then all role-players will have to play their part , including this Legislature . 
<zu> but that BEE-owned companies and emerging contractors enjoy maximum benefit from the contracts put out to tender . Treasury has accordingly developed a standardised infrastructure procurement policy 
<zu> We remain determined therefore to fulfil our obligations to the taxpaying citizens of this country by maintaining and indeed improving our high standards in the field of financial management and good governance . 
<zu> Treasury took an unprecedented move to engage lawyers to oppose court applications against the Department of Social Welfare , and that saved millions of rands while it uncovered a scam which was draining funds destined for the poor . 
<zu> Mr Speaker , Honourable Members , I must stress that if the deadline for the project to be operational by 2009 is to be met 
<zu> and other irregularities , amounting to the loss of tens of millions of rands in various departments , public entities and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year . 
<zu> in such a way that governments BEE policy and objectives are met . I expect in the coming year to be able to report actual expenditure figures per department on procurement from BEE companies , SMMEs and cooperatives . 
<zu> unless at the same time we focus as a government on improving efficiencies and achieving better value for the vast sums of money we spend on these programmes . 
<zu> May I remind you again of the words of Alfred lord Tennyson who said: 
<zu> We propose to set aside R90 million and R100 million in 2007/08 and 2008/09 respectively for development of the IDZ , 
<zu> In the MTEF period , therefore , funding allocations of R50 , R55m and R60m have been set aside for the development of soccer at all levels in the province in collaboration with SAFA 
<zu> with a toll free number to assist with queries . This will be set up by April this year . 
<zu> Progress was also made in enforcing our policy of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption . Six high profile investigations into fraud , corruption , theft , mismanagement , maladministration 
<zu> I can say with some confidence that the programmes and economic sectors being prioritised by government , with one or two exceptions , appear to be yielding positive results in terms of performance and trends over the last two years . 
<zu> In respect of Performance Budgeting System , the rollout of the system in departments is proceeding on schedule , and demonstration data bases have been installed in Provincial Treasury , Health and Transport . 
<zu> that will bring banks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of SMMEs in the Province , thereby relieving the pressure on Ithala . 
<zu> The balance of funds required will have to come from debt financing . The Development Bank has already agreed in principle to provide debt funding secured against revenue streams of the project up to R500m . 
<zu> income per capita will rise by 50 in the next ten years , and the rate of unemployment will be halved . 
<zu> In this regard , government has identified several key projects and programmes as priorities for the forthcoming MTEF . These can be summarised as follows: 
<zu> It is unrealistic however , to expect that the provincial economy will launch itself onto a higher growth path on its own accord . A structural growth acceleration of this magnitude will require , 
<zu> We have secured a legally binding MoU with ACSA and the National Minister of Transport providing for: 
<zu> Site preparation and installation of backbone infrastructure is expected to commence by the end of the calendar year . 
<zu> The challenge facing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within planned timeframes , 
<zu> and the commissioning of a study by a team of NSIC experts to review the current mechanisms , legislation and policies in the province designed to support SMMEs in the province . 
<zu> It is often heard that lengthy delays occur in paying the SMMEs 
<zu> When President Mbeki said: Clearly the masses of our people are convinced that our country has entered into its age of Hope , I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say SIYAVUMA . 
<zu> based on an average of 9 people per cooperative  many of these have already found employment through their cooperatives or are likely to do so in the near future . 
<zu> to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camps . We are also of the view however that we need not just to build soccer stadium infrastructure , but also the sport itself in the province . 
<zu> Discussions are also in progress on the financing model for the Trade Port . The total investment required for the airport , which is part of the Trade Port , is about R2 .5 billion over the next four to five years . 
<zu> 70 at Social Welfare ; 23 at Home Affairs ; 3 ,979 in other departments ; and 15 medical doctors and agents were implicated . 
<zu> backbone infrastructure outlay and the development of the N2 interchange . The tenders for this initial site preparation and technical work have already closed and are currently being adjudicated . 
<zu> once again well above the national average , and close to the ASGI-SA target of 6 . 
<zu> The provincial budget will accordingly continue to play a key role as policy instrument to address the socioeconomic challenges confronting us . 
<zu> This is concrete proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empowerment . 
<zu> Funding in the amount of R50m , R55m and R60 ,5m has been allocated to the Department of Economic Development for the establishment of secondary and tertiary cooperatives in the MTEF period . 
<zu> We have undertaken to cooperate with and assist the South African Women Entrepreneurs in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry . 
<zu> This IDZ was proclaimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 2002 . Since then , however , there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure outlays required to make the IDZ work . 
<zu> to select at least 2 , but no more than 3 
<zu> stimulating economic growth through coordinated infrastructure investment , creating jobs and alleviating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy , and expansion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery . 
<zu> and that have sufficient experience and resources 
<zu> INTERVENTION THREE: Value for money and good governance initiatives 
<zu> It is surely no coincidence , however , that growth in the construction sector is surging , given the provincial governments increased expenditure on infrastructure totalling R7 ,42 bn over the last two years . 
<zu> In this regard , I have tasked the Treasury with establishing a small unit to focus on fast-tracking of payments to cooperatives and SMMEs , 
<zu> Sectors in the province which experienced particularly strong growth in 2004 were construction , which grew at a staggering 28 ,8 , 
<zu> As at the end of December 2005 , Ithala had approved 405 SMME business plans worth R433 million . Of this amount over R179 million has already been disbursed . 
<zu> In April 2006 a detailed Request for Proposals will be issued to selected bidders to prepare more detailed bids . By September 2006 a bidder will be selected and detailed negotiations will commence , 
<zu> During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R200m to Ithala to drive the SMME programme for the province pending the finalisation of a structured SMME Fund . 
<zu> A provincial supply chain management framework policy has been compiled to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to procure goods and services , including from cooperatives , 
<zu> In the coming year therefore , we are going to be implementing a new programme to support SMMEs  the details of which I will reveal shortly . 
<zu> It should come as no surprise therefore , that the budget expenditure proposals for 2006/07 recommended by Cabinet can be categorized into three broad areas which are consistent with the themes which underpinned last years budget , namely: 
<zu> for services rendered and/or supplies provided . 
<zu> The consequence of this is the need to expand the Department of Economic Development , with more staff employed to provide support centres in all districts in collaboration with municipal initiatives and to strengthen Local Economic Development . 
<zu> and the anticipated savings are as follows: R9 ,4m savings per month ; R113m savings per annum and R338m savings over a 3 year period . Furthermore a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspects: 
<zu> - this compares to a growth rate for KZN in 2003 of just 2 ,8 . In 2005 KZNs economic growth rate is projected to be in the region of 5 ,2 , 
<zu> We have welcomed the launch of Small Enterprise Development Agency as a brand of DTI to support SMMEs and coops . 
<zu> improving the unemployment rate from 33 .1 in 2004 to 31 .8 in 2005 . This decrease in unemployment was in fact faster than the national average , which declined from 27 .9 to 26 .5 over the same period . 
<zu> Creating jobs and alleviating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy 
<zu> During the year we invested R80 million in the social welfare grants investigation which has yielded tremendous value to the province . 25 ,956 fraudulent grants were identified in this investigation 
<zu> The deal flow that is currently under consideration by Ithala is standing at R1 .5bn . It is safe to suggest that between R500m to R1bn of those deals would be worthy of funding . 
<zu> As importantly , the payment process to SMMEs by Government Departments leaves much to be desired . 
<zu>  this will have a positive impact on the revival of Ulundi as a regional centre . 
<zu> A tertiary cooperative will provide support to cooperatives through apex level institutions . It will also advocate and engage organs of state , the private sector and the stakeholders on behalf of its members . 
<zu> The second major infrastructure-related programme being advanced by the provincial government relates to financial support for the development of soccer stadiums in the province in preparation for the 2010 World Cup . 
<zu> is that the tertiary cooperative should manage the entire value chain , 
<zu> only by uplifting the masses struggling to survive in the second economy will we be able to achieve sustainably higher growth rates over the longer term , and hence our end-goal of prosperity for all . 
<zu> The growth of cooperatives requires a major shift in our strategy . Coops are a community movement . For sustainability we need to institutionalise the cooperatives movement . 
<zu> Other infrastructure-related strategic projects we propose to fund over the 2006/07 MTEF period are the two road corridors leading to Richards Bay , namely the Lubombo SDI corridor and the P700 linking to Ulundi and ultimately Vryheid . 
<zu> Of the approved business plans to date , 328 involve female only cooperatives , 235 youth , 125 male and 96 mixed cooperatives . 
<zu> Continued support for small business development 
<zu> nor crowd out emerging loan capital , but to complement the existing offerings and provide loan options for those entrepreneurs and small businesses who are presently unable to access affordable loan finance due to a range of factors . 
<zu> The full details of the exact nature , purpose and governance framework for the Fund will be set out in the Information Memorandum for the KZN SMME Fund . 
<zu> Access to research and technical support for better production processes . 
<zu> The business partners and financial institutions who participate in the Fund will by agreement access the existing SMME deal flow generated by Ithala . 
<zu> to address the whole agricultural value chain , including marketing , transport , processing , packaging and branding , the provision of technical advice , and support to emerging farmers through the loan of tractors , implements and equipment . 
<zu> the USA , the Middle East and Asia . Another objective is 
<zu> The initial contribution of R200m from government in the first year of the MTEF will be followed by allocations of R220m and R242m in the outer two years . 
<zu> SMALL BUSINESS ARISE!!! 
<zu> Agrarian revolution 
<zu> The focus of agrarian revolution projects and interventions will be on boosting the capacity of secondary agricultural cooperatives at the district level 
<zu> It must be emphasised that the agrarian revolution concept is not only about agriculture . It embraces the whole spectrum of development of our rural areas , 
<zu> Applicants who have applied to Ithala for loans should not be surprised therefore if their deals end up being financed by another financial institution 
<zu> ABSA has already indicated a willingness to commit R25m to funding small and micro enterprises needing loan finance of less than R3 million . We are also at advanced stages of discussions with Standard Bank and First National . 
<zu> This document will form the basis for the participation of any other financial institution in the Fund . 
<zu> Access to markets 
<zu> Discussions with FNB have not been finalised . Together with a provincial government contribution of R200m which we will make available , the intention is to leverage total funding of over R1 ,5 bn for the SMME Fund by June 2006 . 
<zu> Our message is: 
<zu> The Fund is designed as a central component of a small enterprise lending framework , which seeks not to compete with other commercial SMME lenders in the market , 
<zu>  the important thing is that all SMME business loan applications will be attended to within the coming year . 
<zu> Note that the funds will be held against the Vote of the Provincial Treasury pending disbursement to the SMME Fund . 
<zu> The objective is to develop the provinces enormous potential in agriculture into a competitive advantage by utilising all of its 590 bio-resource regions to produce vegetables , fruit and meat products for export to Europe , 
<zu> A dramatic reduction in farming input costs 
<zu> Standard Bank has indicated that subject to agreement on governance arrangements , they will make available R250m for the financing of SMMEs applying for finance between R3m and R30m . 
<zu> Another key second economy intervention is that of the agrarian revolution , whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to move subsistence farmers upwards towards the first economy . 
<zu> Business Partners in collaboration with Khula , will work with Ithala to open access to Ithala applicants to the R150m start up capital for SMME and BEE funding . 
<zu> Access to support for land reform beneficiaries , and 
<zu> to reduce the reliance on the importation of basic foodstuffs and to bring down food prices through a comprehensive support programme for emerging farmers which will facilitate: 
<zu> Division of revenue framework and revised provincial allocations over the MTEF 
<zu> demonstrating governments ongoing commitment to improving the quality and reach of education . The budget includes additional funding in 
<zu> 'n Ensuring the viability of the land restitution process , through the facilitation of viable programmes for such areas 
<zu> and is a first step towards aligning service delivery provision between the local and provincial spheres of government . 
<zu> The Department of Community Safety & Liaison receives R50 ,8 million this year , an increase of 5 .5 per cent . As the department received a substantial additional allocation last year , there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget . 
<zu> Parliament receives R139 ,2 million , an increase of 7 .6 per cent over the previous year , including an additional allocation over baseline of R15 ,7 million 
<zu> for EMIS , the National Curriculum Statement , ABET , FET Colleges and the introduction of the no fee schools policy . 
<zu> the provision for government employees medical scheme to cover those civil servants not covered by medical aid , and the phasing in of the food relief 
<zu> Education is allocated a budget of R16 ,209 billion . The 2006/07 budget represents an increase of 11 .7 per cent over last year , 
<zu> which provides access to markets 
<zu> and antifraud and corruption measures aimed at streamlining the drivers and learners licence system . Note that the department receives very substantial increases in this budget in the outer two years of the MTEF . 
<zu> This includes additional funding in the amount of R70 million for maintenance , new road works and access bridges , 
<zu> In particular , the unit will work closely with the Department of Economic Development , the Regional Offices of the Land Claims Commission and Land Affairs , and other provincial departments 
<zu> Agriculture and Environmental Affairs receives R1 ,299 billion , an increase of 24 .2 per cent . 
<zu> Included in this allocation is additional funding in the amount of R31m for coordinating the provision of soccer stadia infrastructure in District Municipalities and the Metro , 
<zu> There is a growing need for government to intervene in the second economy through our instrument for economic empowerment , Ithala . While much has been achieved in the last year 
<zu> Note that all funding in the Poverty Alleviation Fund has been allocated to specific departments , while specific allocations have also been made to various departments 
<zu> Establishment of accelerated economic development unit within Ithala 
<zu> I turn now to the expenditure proposals . In line with established practice and sound financial principles , the province is aiming at a balanced budget for the 2006/07 financial year 
<zu> In respect of the total budget allocations for the 2006/07 financial year: 
<zu> Over and above this , most departments will be receiving additional funding over the MTEF for specific purposes and projects , as indicated in Table 3 in the printed speech . 
<zu> with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the 20 major land restitution projects around the province . A Task Team coordinated by the Economic Technical Cluster of Cabinet has already been established 
<zu> Treasury has engaged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate model for the planning , coordination , and approval of the agrarian revolution projects . 
<zu> while service delivery issues and capacity constraints are also addressed in the budget proposals . 
<zu> An amount of R40m will be allocated to the Department of Economic Development in the 2006/07 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit . 
<zu> R280 million for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure ; 
<zu> R50m of this increased allocation is earmarked for the establishment of secondary coops , R100m for primary coops , R30m for the incubator programme , 
<zu> Transports budget of R2 ,416 billion in 2006/07 is an increase of 9 .9 per cent over last year . 
<zu> R110 million to strengthen the FET colleges ; and 
<zu> Investing in revival of township economies 
<zu> The budget proposals will simultaneously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment , job creation , poverty alleviation , and broader participation in the economy 
<zu> from communities and interest groups across the province  we are left with the firm impression that this is truly a budget for the people by the people of the province . 
<zu> Note that the amounts per project are the total sum over the three years of the 2006/07 MTEF period . It should also be noted that 
<zu> Given the limited resources , substantial reprioritization and tradeoffs had to be made  this is of course the essence of what the budgeting process is all about . 
<zu> is the single most important impediment to viability and sustainability , and this aspect will be a major focus area of Ithalas Accelerated Economic Development Unit and the other role-players mentioned . 
<zu> Ithala is therefore in the process of establishing a new business unit called Accelerated Economic Development Unit , which will facilitate delivery in the following areas: 
<zu> The Department of Sport & Recreation is allocated a budget of R106 ,1 million , a 19 .3 per cent increase over last year . 
<zu> and requires a high degree of coordination and cooperation between various provincial departments and district municipalities . The Department of Transports African Renaissance Road Upgrading Programme , 
<zu> Once again Minister Trevor Manuel and the Team Finance have provided invaluable advice and guidance on the technical issues and national budget framework which underpin this budget . 
<zu> As explained this decrease is attributable to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget . The department nevertheless receives 
<zu> Facilitation of new investment and increased trade within the Province 
<zu> However , the quality of information received from departments in their budget submissions in terms of their spatial spending and service delivery gaps was relatively incomplete and inadequate . 
<zu> The budgeted revenue for 2006/07 is made up as follows: 
<zu> the provincial budget actually grows by 13 .4 per cent over last years main budget , again excluding the social security grant funding . This is not an inconsiderable increase , 
<zu> In his medium term budget policy statement , the Minister of Finance tabled the division of revenue between the three government spheres . 
<zu> There are many people who contributed to the budget proposals which we table today . The support provided by the Premier Hon JS Ndebele and my Cabinet Colleagues is most sincerely appreciated . 
<zu> Total funding request by departments 
<zu> will be collectively spending no less than R3bn over the forthcoming MTEF on combating HIV and AIDS , including the further expansion and rollout of the PMTCT , antiretroviral and home-based care programmes 
<zu> Expansion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery 
<zu> Health is allocated a budget of R11 ,737 billion , an increase of 13 .1 per cent . This relatively large percentage increase reflects the high priority which government , both national and provincial , 
<zu> but Hope smiles at the threshold of the year to come whispering , it will be happier  The 2006/07 Provincial budget process 
<zu> For the 2006/07 MTEF , a total of R9 ,7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments . This is against a total of R4 ,6 billion available in the provincial resource envelope . 
<zu> In short , I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proceed , on schedule , along our journey to prosperity for all . 
<zu> Economic Development gets R390 ,1 million in 2006/07 , a 177 per cent increase over last year . Before I am accused of nepotism , let me draw attention to the fact that 
<zu> who have once again have played a most constructive role in engaging with Treasury on budgetary and financial management issues . 
<zu> KZNs share of additional funding 
<zu> The third area which government is prioritising in this budget relates to expanding and improving the quality of existing programmes and projects . Of note are the following allocations: 
<zu> and outer two years of the MTEF period . The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 2005/06 financial year , namely R37 ,192 billion , is allocated to the various provincial departments . 
<zu> Before Honourable Members become alarmed , however , I should explain that the decrease is entirely attributable to the removal of the social security conditional grant funding from the provincial budgets altogether 
<zu> This exercise revealed that indeed we are funding these national priorities more than adequately , and all the national priority programmes have been allocated healthy increases in their baseline budgets over the 2006/07 MTEF . 
<zu> in accordance with their legislative mandates and any sector-specific norms and standards . 
<zu> It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget submissions . If nothing else , this approach has brought about a change in the mindset of departments 
<zu> For the 2006/07 financial year , the province is budgeting for total revenue of R37 ,191 billion . This represents a decrease of 18 ,4 per cent as compared to last years main budget . 
<zu> EPWP and BBBEE principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and maintenance-related projects . 
<zu> This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department , in the amount of R18 ,9 million , as well as R4m for the carry-through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate . 
<zu> R290 million for Adult Basic Education & Training ; 
<zu> in terms of the number of new entrepreneurs entering the market , there is a need to create better focus within Ithala in order to accelerate delivery in this all important empowerment initiative . 
<zu> The Royal Household receives R31 ,4 million in 2006/07 , an increase of 13 .8 per cent over last year . 
<zu> to R13 ,832 bn in 2006/07 compared to R12 ,771 bn in the current year . 
<zu> additional funding totalling R97 ,5m as a result of the phasing in of the Food Relief and HIV and AIDS grants . Although not in our budget the conditional grant for social assistance grants 
<zu> I am confident however that we have succeeded in formulating budget proposals which truly reflect the provincial policy priorities as approved by the provincial executive , and will go a long way towards satisfying the aspirations of popular expectations . 
<zu> and the HIV and AIDS conditional grants into the equitable share . For 2006/07 , R397 million is available for discretionary spending , rising to R3 .2 billion in 2008/09 . 
<zu> shows an increase 
<zu> The number of beneficiaries in year 2000/01 was 621 ,494 compared to 1 ,836 ,975 in year 2004/05 . 
<zu> for the carry-through costs of the Adjustments Estimate allocations last year , and R9 ,5m and R6 ,7m for catering for cultural affairs and office administrative costs respectively . 
<zu> R58 million to develop communal agricultural infrastructure ; 
<zu> The social services are once again prioritised in terms of the growth rates in their MTEF allocations , 
<zu> The purpose of this spatial exercise was to move towards attaining a comprehensive economic alignment strategy for the province , by trying to identify provincial departments spending 
<zu> for coordinating soccer development in the province in collaboration with SAFA , as well the additional allocations already referred to for extra capacity in the executive council secretarial services , 
<zu> cane and timber production become viable and sustainable in as short a time as possible . Without exception , the lack of loan financing for the initial capitalisation of the projects 
<zu> the amount of R135 million 
<zu> from the Provincial Growth Fund for strategic provincial projects such as the Dube Trade Port , Richards Bay IDZ and infrastructure for the 2010 Soccer World Cup . 
<zu> Note the additional allocations made in the two outer years of the MTEF for the establishment of sporting and recreation facilities . 
<zu> The Department of Social Welfare and Populations budget decreases from R13 ,605 bn last year to R895m  a decrease of no less than 93 .4 per cent . 
<zu> The unit will create capacity to deliver on the above areas and thus realising government objectives of reducing poverty and unemployment . 
<zu> REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS: 2006/07 
<zu> R279 million to improve maintenance of hospitals . 
<zu> to ensure that all the national priorities in the fields of education , health care , social welfare services and EPWP programmes were adequately funded . 
<zu> and service delivery gaps within a given spatial area . Ultimately , Treasury would like to compile a profile per district municipality on services provided by provincial departments , 
<zu> Proposed additional allocations to the Office of the Premier will strengthen the secretarial services to the Executive Council , and other provincial committees . 
<zu> R10m for corridor development , and a R15 ,8m allocation to meet the costs of the incorporation of Umzimkhulu into KwaZulu-Natal . 
<zu> Promotion of commercial , as well as viable subsistence farming in previously disadvantaged communities 
<zu> Mr Speaker , I turn now to the detail of the provincial budget proposals for the 2006/07 MTEF . 
<zu> Mr Speaker , we remain committed for example to continue waging a relentless campaign to combat the ravaging effects of the HIV and AIDS syndrome on our society . To this end provincial departments 
<zu> And demanding , because putting budgets together , which involves making informed choices and matching limited resources against competing needs and demands , is never an easy process . 
<zu> for the carry- through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate , new posts and IT support and systems . 
<zu> I also wish to extend my thanks to the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Portfolio Committee , Mr Cyril Xaba and his Committee , 
<zu> Mr Speaker , compiling these budget proposals has been both a pleasurable and demanding task . Pleasurable , in that there has been tremendously positive input and advice received 
<zu> R29m for the Community Development Workers programme , R24 ,1 million for Project Consolidate , Disaster Management Centres and the Rural Connectivity Programme , 
<zu> The Housing budget records a substantial leap to R1 ,252 billion , an increase of no less than 29 .1 per cent over last year . 
<zu> and there is little doubt that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliver on its mandate to the electorate . 
<zu>  this funding has been transferred to the newly established Social Security Agency at a national level . Taking out the social security grant funding of some R13 ,8bn in 2006/07 , 
<zu> The Department of Works receives R451 ,5 million this year , an increase of 6 .0 per cent over the 2005/06 budget . 
<zu> This includes additional funding of R110m as mentioned for the agrarian revolution programme , 
<zu> The main reason for the decrease is that Treasury will no longer have the centralised Poverty Alleviation Fund held against its budget , 
<zu> The Provincial Treasury receives R1 ,069 billion , a nominal decrease of 1 .8 per cent over last years main budget . 
<zu> The primary focus of the 2006/07 Treasury Guidelines was on the review and reprioritisation of departments budgets , as well as on an analysis of their spatial spending and service delivery in each district municipality . 
<zu> The expenditure framework provides for R31 billion in additional equitable share allocation to the provinces over the MTEF . 
<zu> while even the balance of the Provincial Growth Fund and SMME Fund will only be housed in Treasurys budget on a temporary basis , pending approval of projects and consequent transfer of funds to the Ithala 
<zu>  this is the total expenditure across the Departments of Health , Social Welfare and Education . The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty alleviation programmes in their respective budget documentation . 
<zu> The Department of Arts , Culture and Tourism receives a budget of R254 ,7 million , a 21 .6 per cent increase over last year . This includes an additional allocation of R18 ,7 million 
<zu> with the mandate to ensure that the commercial enterprises earmarked for the major land restitution projects such as game farming and ecotourism , 
<zu> R40m for the Accelerated Development Unit in Ithala , and R20m for the Dube Trade Port . Previously these funds were kept in Treasury before they were transferred to Ithala . 
<zu> Mr Speaker , I have dealt at length with the major policy priorities and therefore I wish to briefly explain the division of revenue and MTEF framework which underpins this provincial budget . 
<zu> The Office of the Premier is allocated R 294 ,7 million , an increase of 35 .1 per cent over the 2005/06 budget . This large increase is mainly attributable to an allocation of R50m 
<zu> The Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs gets R595 ,6 million , a 29 .9 per cent increase . 
<zu> Other key role-players include the Departments of Economic Development , Housing , Arts , Culture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land Claims Commission . 
<zu> We are also recommending additional allocations in order to help departments increase their internal capacity and improve service delivery . 
<zu> continues to accord to the delivery of social services , and includes an additional allocation of R24 ,6 million for improving maintenance in hospitals . 
<zu> Mr Speaker , I want to emphasise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for allocation should be apportioned among departments and programmes , we did a comprehensive costing and benchmarking exercise 
<zu> Expenditure proposals and departmental allocations 
<zu> This allocation will also support the regulatory activities of the Gambling Board . A request from the Department of Housing for additional capacity has also been recommended to support various initiatives such as training of housing beneficiaries . 
<zu> Table 1 in the printed speech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further allocation , taking into account projected provincial own revenue and two national policy directives ;

<zu> What is the National Budget? 
<zu> A Peoples Guide . 
<zu> The expanded in governments infrastructure public works programme began projects and in the delivery of in 2004/05 . 
<zu> We all have a role to play in making sure money is not wasted by any of our civil servants . We must combine our efforts in working together toward our economic recovery . 
<zu> Despite governments best efforts , meeting the needs of all South Africans will be tougher over the period ahead . Government officials must remain mindful of the fact that our resources belong to all South Africans . 
<zu> The main areas in the budget that receive more money are: 
<zu> It describes how government will raise money and how it will be spent . The national budget divides money between national departments , provinces and municipalities . Budget highlights on page 4 . 
<zu> because in previous years we handled our finances with discipline . We saved money when our economy was doing well . As a result , we can increase spending on public services without hurting our economy . 
<zu> R6 .4 billion more for public transport , national roads and rail infrastructure 
<zu> From 2009 , government kicks off a new phase of the expanded public works programme . 
<zu> R10 .9 billion more for housing , water , sanitation and municipal services 
<zu> In its first five years ,public services . 
<zu> R45 billion more for provinces to improve education , health and roads and to spend more on rural development 
<zu> More than R4 .1 billion will be invested in this programme to create even more jobs over the next five years . These jobs will be created in: 
<zu> Public works will put more people to work 
<zu> Tougher times ahead 
<zu> Many countries are not able to respond to this situation as we can . South Africa can take these measures to protect our economy and the poor 
<zu> Government is working to create jobs were created by increasing more jobs for unemployed the number of workers used South Africans . 
<zu> Construction , maintenance and environmental protection projects 
<zu> The world economy is in a worse position than it has been in several decades . According to a report by the International Labour Organisation , more than million people could lose their jobs this year 
<zu> Government spending will continue to grow on services that help poor communities , and public works programmes which will create more new jobs . 
<zu> Over R780 billion will be spent on large infrastructure projects over the next three years , including building more power stations , roads and railways , upgrading water and sanitation networks 
<zu> Government aims to increase the number of full time equivalent jobs to 400 000 a year by 2014 , helping to bring down poverty and unemployment . 
<zu> South Africa is not as badly affected , and we want to keep it that way . In fact , we want to do better so that we can continue to provide for the needs of our people . 
<zu> When the economy grows at a slower rate , governments collect less taxes . This means that government will have to borrow to meet some of its spending commitments . 
<zu> and providing more houses . We will also work with business and trade unions to ensure that job losses are kept to a minimum . 
<zu> R5 .4 billion more for improving the criminal justice sector 
<zu> We must also use the period ahead to try and deal with the many challenges facing us . 
<zu> Like the rest of the world , our economy is going to grow more slowly . We too are experiencing job losses and many people will struggle to cover their monthly household expenses .

<zu> CHARACTERISTICS OF HIJACKINGS 
<zu> HIJACKING PREVENTION 
<zu> The publication of the Bill for comment therefore represents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders , interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act . 
<zu> The questions are often raised  why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation  is the coast not simply part of the general environment 
<zu> The review concluded that a dedicated Coastal Management Act was required for implementing the White Paper . 
<zu> This chapter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Minister and the MECs . 
<zu> The coast is a unique part of the environment . It is the meeting place of the land and sea  a limited spatial area that supports many human activities . 
<zu> Section 25 authorises MECs to establish coastal setback lines . 
<zu> The Act also requires municipalities to develop municipal CMPs within four years of the Acts commencement , either as stand alone documents or as part of an integrated development plan prepared in accordance with the Municipal Systems Act . 
<zu> In the past , the value of coastal ecosystems as a cornerstone for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in decision-making in South Africa . 
<zu> The Bill intends to regulate the discharge of effluent into coastal waters from any source on land by requiring permits to authorise such discharges . 
<zu> However , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the Protected Areas Act rather than the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act . 
<zu> The purpose of this Guide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period . 
<zu> The White Paper did not merely provide a vision , principles , goals and objectives for coastal management in South Africa . 
<zu> This chapter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all estuaries by providing that they must be managed , in accordance with: a 
<zu> Chapter 5: Institutional arrangements 
<zu> indicates to whom and where the Act applies and explains that the Act must be read in conjunction with the National Environmental Management Act and explains how to reconcile conflicts with other legislation . 
<zu> Seafront development needs to be located behind the littoral active zone - a hazardous area for development . 
<zu> For coastal development to be socially sustainable , it should emphasise public awareness and shared responsibility , empowering disadvantaged individuals and communities , including women and the poor . 
<zu> The coast is a distinctive system in which a range of considerations  biophysical , economic , social and institutional  interconnect , in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach . 
<zu> MANAGEMENT BILL 
<zu> This chapter provides measures for protecting the coastal environment from activities that may detrimentally affect it and creates procedures for assessing and regulating such activities . 
<zu> to declare that protected areas or parts thereof are not part of the buffer zone . 
<zu> In order to protect and effectively regulate coastal public property , it is also necessary to impose controls and restrictions on certain areas adjacent to coastal public property that form part of coastal ecosystems . 
<zu> The coast needs to be managed as a system in order to make optimal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides . 
<zu> into the existing provincial and municipal land-based and economic development planning procedures in a manner that is consistent with the policy goals of the White Paper . 
<zu> Section 60 authorises the Minister or MEC to issue notices for the repair or removal of structures within the coastal zone . 
<zu> Section 38 provides for the establishment of Provincial Coastal Committees which will be responsible for coordinating coastal management in each province . Section 39 authorizes the MECs of each province to determine the composition of these Committees . 
<zu> Much of the wealth locked up in our coast continues to be wasted due to environmentally insensitive development and activities . Economic and social opportunities for wealth creation and equity are being missed and coastal ecosystems are being degraded . 
<zu> Chapter 10: Enforcement 
<zu> The text of the Bill is available from the Government Printer or can be downloaded from http://www .deat .gov .za/ . 
<zu> set coastal management objectives and include priorities and strategies for achieving these and performance indicators that can be used to measure progress . 
<zu> In order to secure public access to coastal public property , the Bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land . 
<zu> A coastal setback line may , for example , be established to ensure that the shadows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise . 
<zu> In practice this means , for example , that the Minister must ensure that there is consistency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans . 
<zu> Includes: vision , national coastal management objectives . 
<zu> COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME 
<zu> for establishing special management arrangements in a particular area in order to give effect to the recognition in the White Paper that the diversity of the coast requires different management approaches in different areas . 
<zu> The preamble explains the rationale or basis for promulgating the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act . Several factors forming part of this basis are discussed above . 
<zu> Part 5 contains general provisions relating to the temporary occupation of land within the coastal zone for specified purposes and the amendment , suspension or cancellation of authorisations . 
<zu> WHY IS THERE A NEED FOR A NATIONAL COASTAL MANAGEMENT ACT? 
<zu> Chapter 8: Marine and coastal pollution control 
<zu> Once such a line has been established in a zoning scheme , any person who wishes to erect or alter a structure situated seaward of the line must obtain permission before doing so . 
<zu> Sets local policy , strategy & CMOs . 
<zu> Reasons for withdrawing such designation could include instances where the use of coastal access land is causing damage to the environment . The process for designating or withdrawing the designation of coastal access land is described in section 19 . 
<zu> White Paper is regarded as first NCMP 
<zu> THE INTEGRATED COASTAL 
<zu> Such amendment , suspension or cancellation is subject to the criteria specified in section 73 . 
<zu> Sets provincial coastal management policy and strategy consistent with MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES 
<zu> Chapter 6: Coastal management 
<zu> The White Paper recommended new arrangements to coordinate coastal management in South Africa . 
<zu> Section 49 requires the alignment of certain plans with CMPs to ensure coordinated coastal management . Similarly section 50 requires consistency between CMPs and other statutory plans . 
<zu> Pending the determination of an appeal , the Minister or MEC may make an interim order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act . 
<zu> The powers of the Minister and the MECs to review provincial and municipal CMPs respectively are set out in sections 53-54 . 
<zu> A permit is also required in order to undertake certain non-consumptive , commercial uses of coastal public property or the exclusive economic zone in order to provide a mechanism for 
<zu> It sets out the legal mechanisms for establishing a proactive planning system for coastal areas that integrates coastal concerns 
<zu> This is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jointly by several organs of State instead of many separate authorisations . 
<zu> The purpose of a panel is to ensure that the consideration of an appeal is informed by technical expertise where this is required . 
<zu> Sets national coastal management policy and strategy . 
<zu> Management Protocol approved by the Ministers responsible for the environment and for water affairs ; and estuarine management plans for individual estuaries . 
<zu> This chapter establishes integrated procedures for regulating the disposal of effluent and waste into estuaries and the sea . 
<zu> This chapter establishes a statutory framework for new institutional arrangements to ensure integrated and coordinated coastal management . 
<zu> The reason for this is that some protected areas extend sufficiently far inland so as to make it logical to exclude them from the scope of the proposed Act . 
<zu> specially protected coastal areas , and includes any aspect of the environment on , in and above them . 
<zu> This Chapter is designed to extend that system across the land/sea interface in order to allow for integrated coastal planning and the proactive control of the use of coastal resources . 
<zu> This chapter sets out the procedures to be followed when appealing against coastal protection or repair and removal notices or in connection with the granting or refusal of a permit under the Act . 
<zu> The Bill focuses on regulating human activities within , or that affect the coastal zone . 
<zu> Certain land will be regarded as coastal access land when the Bill is enacted but the designation of coastal access land may also be withdrawn or cancelled . 
<zu> The White Paper also emphasizes the importance of facilitating coastal development which is sustainable . This requires development to be ecologically , socially and economically sustainable . 
<zu> national CMP . 
<zu> It also sets out the considerations which must apply in respect of such demarcations and adjustments . Interested and affected parties have an opportunity to contribute to the process of demarcating or adjusting boundaries . 
<zu> The Bill authorises the Minister to dispense with prescribed procedure in respect of dumping in emergencies . For example , vessels in distress due to mechanical failure may need to urgently dump cargo overboard . 
<zu> The Bill provides procedures relating to both discharge and dumping permits . 
<zu> This Part also provides strict guidelines for decision-making which the permit issuing authority must consider . 
<zu> Section 57 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occupiers of land , coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adverse effects on the coastal environment 
<zu> The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CMPs withinfour years of the commencement of the Act that are consistent with the national CMP and the National Estuarine Management Protocol . 
<zu> Protected areas or parts thereof are automatically included in the buffer zone in terms of Section 16 . The purpose of section 22 is to enable the MEC 
<zu> Part 4 deals with the letting of coastal public property by way of coastal leases and the granting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal concessions . 
<zu> This contrasts with the current situation under the Seashore Act where the seashore and sea are owned by the President on behalf of the people .Coastal public property is made up primarily of the seashore and coastal waters . 
<zu> After the Cabinet approved the White Paper a comprehensive legal review was carried out . Its purpose was to determine whether the White Paper could be implemented in terms of existing laws . 
<zu> Early drafts of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas . 
<zu> Section 35 establishes a National Coastal Committee which will function at national government level . Section 36 authorizes the Minister to determine the composition of the Committee . 
<zu> Section 40 authorizes the MECs to appoint Voluntary coastal officers and define their roles and responsibilities . 
<zu> The protocol will provide a national policy for estuary management and guide the development of individual estuarine management plans . 
<zu> Demarcation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal buffer zone are only likely to be instituted where the area designated by the Act is inappropriate and impedes effective coastal management . 
<zu> This provision helps facilitate a new cooperative and participatory approach to managing the coast by enhancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management . 
<zu> Includes: vision , provincial CMOs . 
<zu> The coastal resource use planning system established by this Chapter will function as a mechanism for controlling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is presently used . 
<zu> The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental factors . 
<zu> It took a step further by providing a Plan of Action which outlines in detail how the White Paper is to be implemented . One of the elements of this Plan of Action is Institutional and Legal Development . 
<zu> However , this system  orientated approach has failed to materialize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach focusing 
<zu> Coastal waters are essentially all waters influenced by tides and the sea out to the limits of the territorial sea . 
<zu> rather than as conservation areas . For example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable harvesting of shellfish for subsistence purposes in areas where such harvesting is presently depleting the shellfish resources . 
<zu> Section 59 provides for the Minister or MEC to issue written notices requiring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment . 
<zu> The Minister pointed out that due to its complexity the Bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days . 
<zu> This Bill promotes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management , which views the coast as a system and emphasizes the importance of managing it as such . 
<zu> The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estimated in 1998 to be about R168 billion annually , which was equivalent to about 35 of our annual Gross Domestic Product . 
<zu> Chapter 4: Estuaries 
<zu> Section 37 provides for the designation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level . 
<zu> Restricting or controlling developments in these areas is also essential to take account of the dynamic nature of the coast 
<zu> Parliament requires the publication for public comment of Bills in the Government Gazette before such Bills are introduced in Parliament for the purpose of promulgating them as legally binding Acts . 
<zu> Part 2 
<zu> Chapter 3: Boundaries of coastal areas 
<zu> This chapter defines important words and terms , sets out the objectives of the proposed Act in order to guide the interpretation and application of the Act , clarifies the role of the State in relation to the coastal environment , 
<zu> The Bill also establishes a prohibition of incineration or dumping at sea of waste or other material . 
<zu> Fig . 2 . Coastal Management Programmes a national coastal management programme has been adopted in accordance with section 41 . 
<zu> For coastal development to be ecologically sustainable , it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources . 
<zu> The authorisation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment . 
<zu> Part 3 prohibits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit . 
<zu> For coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diversify opportunities , provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources . 
<zu> Photo: eThekwini Municipality 
<zu> A special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas , 
<zu> Section 68 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for granting permits for the use of coastal resources while maintaining a high level of environmental protection . 
<zu> The current land-use planning system in South Africa is a land-based system that essentially stops at the high water mark . 
<zu> The Bill requires the Minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .

<zu> This resulted , for example , in car-parks being located in dynamic dune areas characterized by drift-sand movement or in areas subject to serious erosion during storm seas . 
<zu> Assessing the environmental impact of activities which may detrimentally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were promulgated in terms of NEMA on 21 April 2006 . 
<zu> Presently the disposal of effluent through pipelines and the dumping of waste from vessels into estuaries or the sea are controlled under different pieces of legislation by different Departments . 
<zu> The White Paper highlights the importance of recognising the value of the coast . 
<zu> The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20 . In the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors . 
<zu> Chapter 7 Protection of Coastal Resources 
<zu> The purpose of sections 31 and 32 is to provide for the formalizing in law of such determinations and adjustments through the marking of boundaries on zoning maps and endorsements by the Registrar of Deeds . 
<zu> and gives the Minister , an MEC or a municipality the power to institute legal proceedings or take other measures in relation to coastal public property or the coastal environment . 
<zu> May enact bylaws to give effect to municipal CMP . 
<zu> This Guide then briefly explains the purpose of each chapter of the Bill and provides an outline of its content . 
<zu> It empowers the Minister or MEC either to consider the appeal personally or to appoint an appeal panel to determine the appeal . 
<zu> Section 23 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 deals with the management of such areas . This is intended to provide a mechanism 
<zu> Chapter 9: Appeals 
<zu> At the heart of the coastal zone is an area of land and water defined as coastal public property , which is the common property of the people of South Africa . 
<zu> Importantly , it will provide a mechanism for translating the results of research regarding how coastal resources should be used 
<zu> When the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament South Africa will for the first time have a national Coastal Management Act in place for managing our coastal zone , a priceless national asset . 
<zu> During the first week of December 2006 the Cabinet approved the publication in the Government Gazette of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill for public comment . In a press release issued on 8 December 2006 , 
<zu> Chapter 11: General Ministerial powers and duties 
<zu> The Bill does not seek to introduce new environmental impact assessment procedures . 
<zu> Chapter 1: Interpretation , objectives and application of act 
<zu> The Guide seeks to achieve this by first explaining the historical context leading to the publication in 2000 of the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa which provided a national policy for managing our coastline . 
<zu> in accordance with section 28 of the National Environmental Management Act , referred to below as NEMA . Section 58 stipulates the requirements which apply to the authorisation of activities causing adverse effects . 
<zu> and is it not already covered by existing environmental legislation? Answers to these questions are discussed below . 
<zu> The coastal zone is illustrated in Figure 1 and defined as the area comprising coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , coastal access land , 
<zu> on their specific sectors such as land-use planning , agriculture , water affairs , nature conservation and others . 
<zu> These national , provincial and municipal CMPs must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover , 
<zu> Procedures relating to public participation in respect of decision-making in accordance with the proposed Act are set out in sections 51-52 . 
<zu> COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES 
<zu> Marthinus Van Schalkwyk , the Minister of Environmental Affairs & Tourism , announced that the Bill would be gazetted on 15 December 2006 . 
<zu> This is in line with the Constitutional imperatives that government ensures accountability , responsiveness and openness . 
<zu> Section 55 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish zoning schemes . Section 56 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal zoning schemes . 
<zu> This chapter provides procedures for demarcating and adjusting the boundaries of coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , special management areas and coastal access land . 
<zu> Chapter 2: The coastal zone 
<zu> This chapter establishes certain offences , determines penalties in respect of offences , provides for offences under the Act to be prosecuted in the magistrates court 
<zu> the control of activities such as offshore tourism . As in the case of the coastal buffer zone , the issuing of permits is subject to environmental impact assessment . 
<zu> This chapter establishes new management and planning procedures for coastal resources to ensure that development is sustainable , integrated and in the interest of all user groups . 
<zu> NATIONAL 
<zu> One of the benefits of the proposed Act is that it will replace three existing Acts completely and will repeal provisions in the Nature Conservation Act , 1987 
<zu> metres . In other instances such as estuaries where tidal influence extends further inland than Coastal access land will secure public access to coastal public property .

<zu> Chapter 12 Miscellaneous Matters 
<zu> prepare and adopt within six years of the commencement of the National Coastal Management Act . 
<zu> For example , in developed areas where the coastal environment has been highly modified , such as Durbans beachfront and Sea Point in Cape Town , the width of the coastal buffer zone could be reduced to less than 100 
<zu> Part 2 describes the powers to be exercised by the Minister and MEC . Section 92 grants the Minister the power to exercise certain functions normally exercised by the MEC if specific circumstances apply . 
<zu> A chapter of the Bill focuses on estuaries which are much sought after for recreation 
<zu> Part 1 deals with the powers of the Minister and of MECs to make regulations to promote the Acts implementation and prescribes the consultative process that is to be followed when making regulations . 
<zu> These include provisions dealing with the continuation of existing leases on , or rights to , coastal public property , the procedures for dealing with unlawful structures on coastal public property , 
<zu> Section 96 deals with the MECs powers to delegate powers or duties assigned to the MEC . 
<zu> of the former Ciskei and the Environmental Conservation Decree ,1992 of the former Transkei . 
<zu> and the continuation of existing lawful activities in the coastal buffer zone that were lawful before the commencement of the Act but that after its commencement may only be conducted with a permit . 
<zu> Part 4 deals with certain General matters . Section 97 deals with Information and reporting on coastal matters . The Minister must make certain information concerning the protection and management of the coastal zone available to the public . 
<zu> The Chapter establishes a hierarchy of coastal management programmes . At the top of the hierarchy is the national CMP which the Minister must 
<zu> This chapter deals with a variety of matters in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the previous management system to the one proposed by the Bill . 
<zu> Section 95 authorises the Minister to exercise certain duties and powers normally exercised by the MEC under certain circumstances . 
<zu> Environmental Affairs and Tourism 
<zu> How we manage our coastal areas will determine whether they remain valuable assets or become degraded liabilities . 
<zu> section 28 sets out procedures whereby the various coastal areas may be specifically demarcated on a case-by-case basis . 
<zu> COSTS AND BENEFITS 
<zu> Fig . 1 . Defining the Coastal Zone . 
<zu> It also deals with other matters such as the repeal and amendment of other laws . 
<zu> The Bill provides that initially the coastal buffer zone would extend one hundred metres inland from the boundary of coastal public property 
<zu> Section 93 authorises the MEC to issue directives to municipalities . 
<zu> in areas that have already been zoned for residential , commercial , industrial or multiple-use purposes , and one kilometre inland in other areas . 
<zu> Part 3 deals with delegations . Section 94 deals with delegations of powers or duties by the Minister . 
<zu> However , since these dimensions are relatively arbitrary and do not take account of the very varied situations along the coast , 
<zu> The responsibilities of the Minister and MECs to prepare reports on the state of the coastal environment are also set out . Section 98 requires the coordination of actions between provinces and municipalities . 
<zu> enhance the ability of each sphere of government to perform their existing coastal management functions and facilitate the further assignment of coastal management responsibilities where appropriate? 
<zu> Accordingly , the Act has been drafted in a manner that will enable it to be implemented in conjunction with other environmental and land-use planning legislation .

<zu> IF ENACTED WILL THE BILL PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE NEW INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT ACT? SOME QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER WHEN SUBMITTING COMMENTS 
<zu> provide a legal basis for applying the principles and achieving the goals and objectives set out in the White Paper? 
<zu> The above publications are available on the following websites: 
<zu> generally or specifically give adequate legal effect to the policy in the White Paper? 
<zu> adjust public and private rights to own and use the coast to ensure that they do not conflict with the implementation of the policy in the White Paper? 
<zu> support the new holistic coordinated and integrated coastal management approach that is central to the White Paper? 
<zu> These will be primarily related to the new function of preparing comprehensive coastal management programmes . 
<zu> provide for the use of economic instruments , as recommended in the White Paper , to support the achievement of the policy objectives? 
<zu> However these costs should be dwarfed by the benefits derived from improved allocation of coastal resources and streamlined management systems . 
<zu> and circumstances that exist along our coast require correspondingly diverse management systems? 
<zu> facilitate the establishment of a range of public/private and other partnerships for the management of areas of the coastal zone based on the recognition that the great diversity of coastal land forms 
<zu> The implementation of the Act will involve some additional costs to organs of State within the national , provincial and local spheres of government . 
<zu> promote equitable access to opportunities and benefits arising from the use of the coast? 
<zu> enhance public rights to use the seashore and balance these with corresponding duties? 
<zu> enable the development of national , provincial and municipal coastal planning systems to regulate the development and use of the coast?

<zu> If it is found that illegal connections are made to these standpipes and not reported to the Council , the standpipe connection will then be disconnected and removed . 
<zu> The flow limiting device will be removed once the outstanding amount is paid in full and the charge to remove the device is paid . However , in the event of a funeral , 
<zu> until the amounts owing have been paid in full . In this regard interest will again be due on the frozen amount from the date that the tampering is detected by the Council . 
<zu> The training programme in this case is vital as it makes customers aware of how to manage with 200 litres of water per day . 
<zu> an application can be made for temporary relief whereby the flow limiter is removed for a specific period up to seven days only . 
<zu> INSTALMENTS WILL BE RAISED ON YOUR MONTHLY CONSOLIDATED BILL AND ARE DUE WHEN RENDERED . FAILURE TO PAY WITHIN 21 DAYS FROM DATE OF ACCOUNT 
<zu> Where an informal community located on privately owned land , the permission of the private land owner must be given before such a service can be provided . 
<zu> RECONNECTION WILL THEN ONLY BE EFFECTED ONCE THE ENTIRE DEBT HAS BEEN PAID . 
<zu> and the tampering is detected by the Council before it has been reported to eThekwini Water Services by the customer , then the supply of water to the property will be permanently disconnected 
<zu> This will be done upon payment of the prescribed fee of three hundred rand to be reviewed annually . The flow limiter will be re installed after seven days . 
<zu> The customer is also made aware that if the flow limiting device is tampered with in any way and the supply of water to the property increases above 200 litres a day

<zu> Other implementation mechanisms that will be operationalised are a Language Code of Conduct for Public Servants , 
<zu> The implementation of the language policy willincrease the demand for translation and editing work and interpreting services , especially in the indigenous languages . 
<zu> LANGUAGE POLICY 
<zu> In cases where government documents will not be made available in all 11 official languages , national government departments must publish documents simultaneously in at least six languages . The selection of languages will be made as follows: 
<zu> The availability of Human Language Technology applications  for the indigenous languages will play a major supporting role in language facilitation activities . 
<zu> public and private institutions have a tendency to take ad hoc language decisions that negate the constitutional provisions and requirements relating to languages . 
<zu> must therefore cater adequately for the harmonisation of language policy at all three levels of government and articulate clear policy positions on the status and use of the indigenous official languages in all nine provinces in South Africa . 
<zu> National Language Policy Framework - 2002 
<zu> Language in Education Policy 
<zu> It takes into account the broad acceptance of linguistic diversity , social justice , the principle of equal access to public services and programmes , and respect for language rights . 
<zu> Introduction 
<zu> To promote multilingualism this policy determines the use of different languages in government structures as follows: 
<zu> The use of three or more languages by an individual or by a group of speakers such as the inhabitants of a particular region or a nation .

<zu> GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
<zu> Since the first occupation of South Africa by the Dutch in 1652 , through successive periods of British rule , the Union of South Africa , and subsequently the establishment of the Republic of South Africa 
<zu> Legislative context 
<zu> Official language 
<zu> The equal treatment of two or more languages , especially with regard to official domains of society such as legislation , justice , public administration and instruction . 
<zu> After eight years of democracy , South Africa has now arrived at a crucial point in its history . South Africans have to respond to their linguistic and cultural

<zu> SECTION 4: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES 
<zu> Southern African Development Community 
<zu> Working in collaborative partnerships to promote constitutional multilingualism ; 
<zu> A persons language is in many ways a second skin: a natural possession of every normal human being , with which we use to express our hopes and ideals , 
<zu> At least one from the Nguni group ; 
<zu> Section 6 and contain language-related provisions for national and provincial governments , whereby government departments must use at least two of the official languages . 
<zu> Heritage Languages 
<zu> Monitoring mechanisms for assuring the quality of translation and editing services will be developed . 
<zu> while sections 30 and 31 refer to peoples rights in terms of cultural , religious and linguistic participation and enjoyment . 
<zu> Medium of instruction 
<zu> A language native to a country . 
<zu> This document sets out an enabling framework for a coherent multilingual dispensation within the parameters of the Constitution . 
<zu> Standardised technical terms established for a specific subject field . 
<zu> Language planning focuses on solutions to language problems by formulating alternative goals , means and outcomes . It involves processes of regulating and improving languages through language development . 
<zu> Where the effective and stable operation of government at any level requires comprehensive communication of information , it must be published in all 11 official languages and , in the provinces , in all the official languages prescribed in the Province . 
<zu> SECTION 4 
<zu> Local governments will determine the language use and preferences of their communities within an enabling provincial language policy framework . 
<zu> The Constitution emphasises that all official languages must enjoy parity of 
<zu> Approach 
<zu> Government will encourage , and where necessary support , private enterprises to develop and implement their own language policies in accordance with the national language policy framework . 
<zu> A language used in government , courts of law , education , business , and the media . 
<zu> For example , Xitsonga , Tshivenda , isiNdebele and si 
<zu> leading to the use of English and Afrikaans as the most dominant languages in the socioeconomic and political domains of our society . 
<zu> LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS 
<zu> which are held not only by English and Afrikaans speakers , but even by many of the speakers of the African languages themselves . 
<zu> and that our indigenous languages should be part of the rapidly expanding technological environment . Hence , it intends to reaffirm the status and use of the indigenous languages of South Africa . 
<zu> Department of Arts and Culture 
<zu> Aims Principles Approach Scope 
<zu> By consensus , each government structure must agree on a working language ; Provided that where practically possible no person will be prevented from using the language of his or her preference . 
<zu> Human Language Technologies 
<zu> Languages not indigenous to a country but brought by immigrants . 
<zu> SECTION 2: KEY ELEMENTS 
<zu> This is the finalisation of a process that started in 1995 , when I appointed the Language Plan Task Group to advise me on a framework for a coherent language policy and plan . 
<zu> Capacity building in the identified areas of language facilitation will take place in close collaboration with service providers such as tertiary institutions offering SAQA-accredited programmes 
<zu> Refers to the choice of a particular language in a particular situation , multilingualism determined by the context in which the language is used , i .e . the function , the audience and the message for which it is employed . 
<zu> in collaboration with my Advisory Panel on Language Policy . The policy framework is fundamental to the management of our diverse language resources 
<zu> I am particularly proud that , after a thorough process of consultation , we are finally in a position to announce a framework for a language policy for South Africa . 
<zu> encourage the learning of other official indigenous languages to promote national unity , and linguistic and cultural diversity ; and promote good language management for efficient public service administration to meet client expectations and needs . 
<zu> promote the equitable use of the 11 official languages ; 
<zu> South African Qualifications Authority 
<zu> It is in this spirit that the promotion of all 11 official languages of our country , as provided for in the Constitution , takes centre stage in the policy . 
<zu> Language awareness 
<zu> and the growing criticism from language stakeholders of the tendency towards unilingualism in South Africa . 
<zu> The Constitution and related legislation clearly advocate the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa . This policy framework 
<zu> The language policy takes cognisance of the constitutional provisions on multilingualism and is in concert with governments goals for economic , socio-political and educational growth . Its aims are to  
<zu> SECTION 3 
<zu> In collaboration with PanSALB , the Department of Arts and Culture will monitor progress and report at specified intervals to all relevant authorities . 
<zu> The language policy is based on the following principles: 
<zu> At least one from the Sotho group ; 
<zu> Section 6 of the Constitution provides the principal legal framework for multilingualism , the development of the official languages and the promotion of respect 
<zu> I believe that collectively we have to ensure that the policy becomes a reality in our lives , affirming and making us proud of our unique South African identity . 
<zu> The official languages will be used in all legislative activities , including Hansard publications , 
<zu> All government structures , as well as institutions exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of legislation are bound by this Language Policy Framework . 
<zu> There is currently a strong awareness of the need to intensify efforts to develop the previously marginalised indigenous languages and to promote multilingualism 
<zu> Translation 
<zu> When a language loses its value in these spheres the status of the language diminishes . This Policy Framework also takes into account that we are faced with the challenge of globalisation 
<zu> The progressive phasing in of the implementation of the policy in the short , medium and long term is the preferred strategy at all levels .

<zu> The approach recognises the following: 
<zu> ensure redress for the previously marginalised official indigenous languages ; 
<zu> The NLS will be required to coordinate the management of policy implementation by facilitating training for language unit staff in language planning activities and support of the work programmes of these units .

<zu> Promoting multilingualism in South Africa requires efforts that do not discount the knowledge that exists in societies where indigenous official languages are prominent . 
<zu> facilitate equitable access to government services , knowledge and information ; 
<zu> International communication: Government communication at the international level will normally be in English or ad hoc in the preferred language of the country concerned . 
<zu> This will be facilitated by the use and involvement of communities as participants in the processes of language development .

<zu> South African Sign Language 
<zu> Principles 
<zu> The core of translation expertise in these languages will have to be expanded both in government departments and in the private sector , i .e . freelance language practitioners such as translators , editors 
<zu> All these practices engendered the corollary status of the indigenous languages and language varieties of the African people 
<zu> The act of transposing a text from a source language to another  language in written form . 
<zu> The Policy Framework not only initiates a fresh approach to multilingualism in South Africa , but strongly encourages the utilisation of the indigenous languages as official languages in order to foster and promote national unity . 
<zu> It will be expedient to engage language specialists to assist the process of developing functional multilingual programmes through research and the dissemination of findings . 
<zu> LANGTAG 
<zu> SECTION 2 
<zu> The Department of Education introduced a Language in Education Policy , which stresses multilingualism as an extension of cultural diversity and an integral part of building a non-racial South Africa . 
<zu> The scope or provisions of the policy are as follows: 
<zu> Equity 
<zu> LiEP deals with such matters as language of learning and teaching in public schools , school curricula , and the language-related duties of provincial departments of education and school governing bodies . 
<zu> if South Africans are to be liberated from undue reliance on the utilisation of non-indigenous languages as the dominant , official languages of the state . 
<zu> Supporting the learning and teaching of all official South African languages at all levels of schooling . 
<zu> diversity and to the challenges of constitutional multilingualism , hence the introduction of this National Language Policy Framework . 
<zu> In terms of the Constitution , all languages are to receive equal respect . 
<zu> Additional government responsibilities regarding the implementation of the national language policy are as follows: 
<zu> All oral communication must take place in the preferred official language of the target audience . If necessary , every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as interpreting where practically possible . 
<zu> Supporting the development of human resources required for successful implementation of multilingualism ; 
<zu> SECTION 1 
<zu> Other relevant provisions pertaining to language matters are made elsewhere in the Constitution . Section 9 protects against unfair discrimination on the grounds of language , 
<zu> Regarding government publications , implementation will be phased in flexibly and pragmatically by government structures over a period of at least three years . 
<zu> BUILDING HUMAN CAPACITY 
<zu> initiate and sustain a vibrant discourse on multilingualism with all language communities ;

<zu> In the South African context , these are the languages that were assigned disadvantaged low status by former powerful groups and which were , as a result , not used languages 
<zu> Policy reviews will be conducted regularly and recommendations will be made for amendments where necessary so that budgets can be adjusted accordingly . 
<zu> Government structures will have time to plan their budgets by gradually increasing allocations over the MTEF period and planning operations in line with the resources required for successful policy implementation . 
<zu> Sensitivity to how language is used in society , whether the users are accorded their language rights , and how language is used to empower or disempower . 
<zu>  CONTENTS 
<zu> Scope 
<zu> Deleted: This situation was reversed with the advent of democracy in 1994 and the Constitutional provisions on official multilingualism . 
<zu> To date management of linguistic diversity in post-apartheid South Africa has been made problematic by the lack of a clearly defined language policy , 
<zu> Department of Education 
<zu> The underlying principle is to retain the learners home language for learning and teaching , but to encourage learners to acquire additional languages as well . 
<zu> Language equity 
<zu> education , legal and administrative systems , etc . ; and by generally providing scope for the publication of literary works in that language . 
<zu> The right to use the official languages of our choice has therefore been recognised in our Bill of Rights , and our Constitution acknowledges that the languages of our people are a resource that should be harnessed . 
<zu> In promoting multilingualism provinces will formulate their policies in line with the guidelines contained in this Policy Framework , taking into account their regional circumstances , and the needs and preferences of communities , as stated in the Constitution . 
<zu> Interpreting 
<zu> This step was essential in view of the lack of tolerance for linguistic diversity and the resultant multilingualism is a costly problem approach evident in some sectors of our society , 
<zu> Laws determining the situations in which citizens can make language choices . 
<zu> Government agencies in departments and provinces to deal with specific language issues of that department and/or province arising from the National Language Policy and to liaise with other departments on language matters . 
<zu> 2 .4 .6 .2 . Communication with members of the public: For official correspondence purposes , the language of the citizens choice must be used . 
<zu> A principle of rotation must be applied when selecting languages for publishing government documents in the Nguni and Sotho groups . 
<zu> KEY ELEMENTS OF THE POLICY 
<zu> Historical context 
<zu> Regulating the language facilitation profession , i .e . translation , interpreting and terminology development , through development and appropriate legislation ; 
<zu> Indigenous language 
<zu> of terminology in the official languages and of a National Termbank that is accessible to both government and freelance language practitioners . 
<zu> the establishment of the SA Language Practitioners Council , a Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa , a strategy for the development of the previously marginalised languages and an HLT Strategy . 
<zu> Terminology 
<zu> Bilingualism 
<zu> For the purposes of conducting meetings or performing specific tasks every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as translation and/or interpreting where practically possible . 
<zu> A community-based approach to the promotion of multilingualism is the most viable one , given South Africas highly pluralistic society . 
<zu> South Africa is therefore a multilingual country . A striking characteristic of multilingualism in South Africa is the fact that several indigenous languages are spoken across provincial borders ; shared by speech communities from different provinces . 
<zu> The act of effecting corrections to language and/or style in written texts . 
<zu> Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 
<zu> Language equality 
<zu> The promotion of a language by graphisation , standardisation and language elaboration of functions so that the language can be used in the media , 
<zu> National Language Service 
<zu> and tolerance for South Africas linguistic diversity . It determines the language rights of citizens , which must be honoured through national language policies . 
<zu> To promote linguistic diversity further , section 6 provides for the establishment of the Pan South African Language Board to promote multilingualism 
<zu> Government publications: A publication programme of functional multilingualism should be followed by national government departments in those cases that do not require publication in all 11 official languages . 
<zu> articulate our thoughts and values , explore our experience and customs , and construct our society and the laws that govern it . It is through language that we function as human beings in an ever-changing world .

<zu> Section of Act
<zu>  , or the Consumer Protection Act , 2008 ;
<zu> The Draft Consumer Policy Framework , which recommended that comprehensive consumer protection legislation be formulated to implement the consumer protection policy and to create the necessary infrastructure to regulate the market for consumer goods and services , was presented to the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry and tabled at NEDLAC .
<zu> Any business name that , as of the general effective date , was registered in terms of any repealed law , must be regarded as having been registered in terms of this Act , as of the effective date .

<zu> to 58 Apply only with respect to any goods or services supplied to the consumer in terms of the agreement , on or after the general effective date .
<zu> or the transaction is between two parties who are part of the supply chain if the value of the transaction falls above a threshold prescribed by the Minister .
<zu> Currently , business name registration is optional , serving to protect businesses from other persons encroaching on a trading identity .
<zu> It also prohibits informing consumers that they have won a prize when no competition has been conducted , or they have never entered a competition , or making the prize subject to a previously undisclosed condition payment of any consideration , whether for participating in the competition or for the prize itself .
<zu> The equality court is recognised as having exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate contraventions of this part in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act .
<zu> The Minister may make regulations to set deposits of containers , pallets and similar objects to be refunded to the consumer when they return it to the supplier .
<zu> Clause 26 makes it compulsory for sales records of every transaction to be provided to the consumer and prescribes the information that must be contained in a sales record .
<zu> Therefore , the Bill proposes a significant change in the current business name registration scheme by making it mandatory rather than voluntary .
<zu> Such goods , when delivered , must correspond with the description or sample , or the consumer has a limited right to return them under clause 20 .
<zu> The laws that will be repealed , as set out in clause 121 and the consequential amendments , are :
<zu> The Bill recognises that consumer protection is a matter that falls under the functional area of concurrent jurisdiction between provincial and national government in terms of Schedule 4 to the Constitution .
<zu> and intervening in any matter before any forum contemplated in this Act if the interest of consumers represented by that group are not otherwise adequately represented in that forum .
<zu> This particularly applies to circumstances where the consumer is buying on the basis of a description or sample .
<zu> Repeal and replacement of current laws
<zu> Under the existing regulatory framework , the Consumer Affairs Act , 1988 , and various other laws regulate consumer protection .
<zu> This includes commissions earned , and entities whom they represent .
<zu> This will harmonise this Bill with other laws that require differential treatment , for example , the prohibition of sales of alcohol to under-age minors .
<zu> Under the Bill , a person who carries on business may only do that in the persons own full name as recorded in an official form of identification , registered name or a registered alternative business name . Trade catalogues and circulars have to reflect that name , description of the business and statement of the place where it is carried on .
<zu> In respect of lay-bys it provides that suppliers are accountable for amounts paid by consumers for lay-bys , and that the goods remain at the risk of the supplier .
<zu> Clause 36 prohibits offering prizes with the intention of not providing them .
<zu> In addition , accredited consumer protection groups have a right to be consulted in respect of any proposed industry code of practice , and any proposed regulations .
<zu> The Minister has authority to exempt certain categories of transaction from that requirement .
<zu> Right to honest and fair dealing
<zu> The right to choose includes the right to decide whether or not to continue a commercial arrangement during the course of an agreement , and once it has expired .
<zu> Unconscionable conduct , force , coercion , undue influence , pressure or harassment , unfair tactics or conduct is prohibited in connection with any marketing , supply , negotiation , collection or recovery of goods from consumers .
<zu> Persons who attend at a consumers place of business or residence to deliver or install any goods , or perform any services , must wear satisfactory identification .
<zu> If goods are reconditioned that has to be disclosed , and if they have been imported without the benefit of the manufacturers warranty , that fact must be disclosed .
<zu> A number of specific marketing and selling practices are prohibited , including bait marketing , negative options and referral selling .
<zu> Suppliers are prohibited from requiring consumers to purchase bundled goods or services as described in clause 13 , unless it can be proven that the bundling results in economic benefit for consumers .
<zu> The right to equal access to the consumer market
<zu> Suppliers are obligated under the Bill to accept the return of waste goods that may not be accepted in the common waste collection system .
<zu> The right to equal access expands on and is conceptually linked to both the Bill of Rights and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act , 2000 . It protects communities , districts , market segments or populations from being unfairly discriminated against with regards to access to goods or services of different quality or pricing .
<zu> Clause 39 addresses the legal status of agreements between suppliers and persons who lack legal capacity to enter into such an agreement .
<zu> Right to be heard and obtain redress The Bill aims to make redress accessible , and to protect consumers from being victimised if they act to enforce their rights .
<zu> It is not to displace or over-ride more specific schemes of consumer protection established in terms of any industry-specific law .
<zu> Clause 69 outlines the available avenues of redress , including the courts , alternative dispute resolution , and complaint to the Commission .
<zu> Consumers who are approached by direct marketers often feel psychologi-cally pressured to agree to a transaction .
<zu> The Bill codifies a number of fundamental consumer rights , as discussed below .
<zu> The Bill seeks to advance that right with the following provisions :
<zu> Unreasonable transactions as described in clause 48 are prohibited , as are unjust or unfair terms or conditions .
<zu> determination of steps to be taken to ensure the performance of a particular function by a provincial consumer protection authority , in the case where no provincial consumer protection authority has been established ;
<zu> In terms of clause 61 , a producer , distributor or supplier of a good is strictly liable for any harm wholly or partly caused as a consequence of product defect or failure , with certain exceptions .
<zu> It will also permit the common practice of discounted prices for children , or for persons over a certain age , and will permit the continued use of separate facilities for different genders .
<zu> Finally , clause 67 requires suppliers to return parts and materials remaining from maintenance work .
<zu> This Bill proposes to repeal several laws replacing them with a single Consumer Protection Act , which will also give priority to its own procedures for enforcement and will modify the common law in several respects .
<zu> Because that sort of agreement is often not an exercise of free choice , clause 16 establishes the consumers right to cancel such an agreement without penalty during a brief cooling-off period of five business days .
<zu> The Bill is intended to provide a general default regime of consumer protection .
<zu> Right to fair , just and reasonable terms and conditions
<zu> The Minister may exempt certain transactions or services below a certain threshold .
<zu> The Bill promotes consumer activism .
<zu> Meaning of transaction and consumer
<zu> In order to enhance consumer choice the Bill introduces a number of provisions that are aimed at assisting consumers to select goods or services on the basis of having examined the goods and compared prices .
<zu> The right of consumers to privacy includes the right to accept , refuse or block any approach for the purpose of direct marketing .
<zu> To restrain or correct the worst abuses in the area of the marketing of goods or services , the Bill introduces or re-enacts a number of provisions to address the following matters :
<zu> The Minister may prescribe the information or records that intermediaries or categories of intermediaries must keep .
<zu> It further requires the supplier to compensate the consumer if the supplier is unable to produce the goods once the full price has been paid by the consumer .
<zu> To this end , the Bill provides for the Minister to consult the Members of the Provincial Executive Councils responsible for consumer affairs with respect to the co-ordination and harmonisation of the functions of the Commission and the provincial consumer protection authorities ;
<zu> The right to disclosure aims to ensure that consumers understand the terms and conditions of the transactions or agreements they enter into and are able to make informed choices about the products and services they consume .
<zu> A supplier or a person acting on his or her behalf is prohibited from making false , misleading or deceptive representations in respect of any goods and services under the circumstances listed in clause 41 .
<zu> In addition , if the consumer had informed the supplier of the use he wants to put the goods to , the consumer has the right to expect that it will be suitable for that particular purpose .
<zu> An ombud , consumer court or provincial authority that has resolved a complaint may record the agreement as an order , which must then be confirmed as a consent order by the courts .
<zu> The right to choose encompasses the consumers right to examine goods .
<zu> The Bill imposes an obligation on the supplier to issue alerts of any activity or facility that is subject to any hazard that could result in serious injury or death to consumers ;
<zu> Trade descriptions applied to any goods must not be misleading , and must not be tampered with . The Minister may prescribe categories of goods to which a trade description must be applied .
<zu> The Bill replaces the current Lottery Act scheme for regulating promotional competitions .
<zu> To this end consumers have the following rights :
<zu> Suppliers accountability to consumers
<zu> The Bill sets out standards for fair and responsible marketing and provides a general prohibition against marketing that is misleading , fraudulent or deceptive , as described in clause 35 .
<zu> To further protect consumers , the Minister may prescribe certain days , dates and times during which it is prohibited to contact consumers for promotional purposes .
<zu> There is a prohibition against overselling and overbooking , which requires a supplier not to accept consideration for any goods or services unless they reasonably expect to have capacity to supply them or intend to provide goods or services that are materially different . Consumers have to be refunded in full with interest and consumers can also claim contractual and consequential damages , including economic losses .
<zu> The liability provided for in the Bill is in addition to any other liability of that person in terms of any law , and extends to loss arising from death , illness or injury , or loss or damage to any property .
<zu> Clause 58 provides guidance to the courts with regards to how they should assess unconscionable conduct , unfair , unjust or unreasonable contract terms , or deal with prohibited contract terms .
<zu> If an advertisement or notice states that prices are subject to a reduction or sale price , clause 23 provides for a consistent application of such notices , so that consumers can better compare prices in a consistent fashion .
<zu> If the sponsor of a loyalty programme keeps a register of members , the sponsor may increase the price of rewards only after notifying the members .
<zu> or a franchisee in terms of a franchise agreement .
<zu> The definition of consumer is extended to the actual users of goods or services , regardless of who actually may have conducted a transaction or paid for the goods or services .
<zu> The Bill makes it compulsory to display prices for any goods that are displayed for sale .
<zu> The right to choose also includes the right of the consumer to cancel advance reservations or bookings , but suppliers may charge advance deposits and impose reasonable cancellation penalties .
<zu> The dti believes that consumers have a right , and need , to be able to ascertain the identity of the legal person with whom they are dealing .
<zu> or the Minister has concluded that the existing provincial consumer protection authority is unable to perform that function effectively .
<zu> Upfront disclosure for preparing an estimate is also required .
<zu> Therefore , clause 5 provides for the Minister to grant industry-wide exemptions from the application of specific provisions of this Bill on the request of a relevant industry regulator , if the National Consumer Commission advises that the specific industry scheme offers at least as much protection for consumers as they would have under this Bill .
<zu> The Bill recognises the role of civil society in consumer protection by providing for the support of any juristic person or association of persons that meet the set criteria as consumer protection groups .
<zu> Consumer Affairs Act , 1988 Trade Practices Act , 1976 Sale and Service Matters Act , 1964 Business Names Act , 1960 Businesses Act , 1991 Price Control Act , 1964 Sections 2 to 13 and sections 16 to 17 of the Merchandise Marks Act , 1941 Section 54 of the Lotteries Act , 1997 , and related regulations .
<zu> Clause 26 sets out disclosure requirements that intermediaries who are not regulated under another law have to comply with .
<zu> Clause 17 describes circum-stances under which a cancellation penalty may be considered unreasonable .
<zu> notice or instructions of safe handling of goods ;
<zu> In addition , it will allow suppliers to target their marketing to specific population groups to the extent that is reasonable , having regard to the goods and services being offered .
<zu> However , the supplier can exceed the original estimate if the consumer in writing declines the estimate or pre-authorises any charges up to a specified maximum .
<zu> Thus , depending on the context , a consumer means a person to whom goods or services are marketed in the ordinary course of business ; a person who has entered into an agreement or transaction with a supplier ;
<zu> The Bill applies to goods or services whether promoted by a for profit business , or by a non-profit entity , the State or entities contracted by the State , including Public Private Partnerships .
<zu> Suppliers of repair , maintenance or replacement services cannot charge consumers for these services unless the consumer was provided with an estimate which the consumer has authorised .
<zu> The Bill regulates loyalty programmes by requiring sponsors of loyalty programmes to meet their obligations when loyalty credits are tendered , prohibits offering inferior quality products or requiring the bundling of reward goods or services with revenue products , requires a supplier to accept the tender of sufficient loyalty credits as adequate consideration for goods and services at any time , subject to limited black-out periods .
<zu> In addition , clause 2 specifically provides that in case of a conflict between this Bill and any other law protecting consumers within an industry , the laws are to be enforced concurrently , as far as possible , and beyond that , the law that provides the greater degree of protection for consumers is to prevail .
<zu> Clause 82 establishes a scheme for the development through consultation of industry codes of conduct relating to consumer matters , and provides for them to receive the force of law by being prescribed by the Minister .
<zu> If a third party has a legal claim over the goods , the supplier is liable to that third party , unless it can be shown that the supplier and consumer colluded to defraud the third party .
<zu> Certain agreements or provisions of agreements are listed as unlawful in clause 51 , and are void from inception irrespective of the common law or provision of other laws .
<zu> The Bill aims to codify and improve on the common law by addressing unfair contract terms and provide consumers with remedies where there have been breaches of contract .
<zu> Clause 63 provides that prepaid certificates , credits and vouchers remain negotiable for up to five years , and that the supplier is obligated to honour them when presented .
<zu> Clause 22 outlines the circumstances under which a document would be considered to be in plain language , and the Commission may publish guidelines for methods assessing whether a document satisfies that requirement .
<zu> The Bill retains the existing prohibitions against fraudulent schemes and offers , pyramid and related schemes .
<zu> The dti believes that large transactions involving large businesses and the State do not require the protection offered by the Bill because they would benefit from the flexibility of operating in an unregulated market . Therefore , the Bill will not apply to transactions when the consumer is the State , or any organ of state ;
<zu> New provisions in clause 45 aim to ensure fairness in auctions by regulating the participation of owners or their agents as bidders , and requiring notice of any reserve bid or upset price .
<zu> Clause 33 establishes standards for the conduct of catalogue sales , clause 34 regulates the use of trade coupons , and clause 37 regulates the marketing of work from home schemes .
<zu> The provisions regarding the criteria for , and registration of , business names have been revised , modernised and harmonised with proposals under discussion for criteria applicable to companies in terms of the Companies Act .
<zu> To enable consumers to exercise this right the Act provides for consumers to make a formal demand to a marketer to discontinue any such approach to that consumer , and it contemplates the establishment of an Exclusion Register either by industry or by the Commission .
<zu> The Bill will apply to most transactions in the ordinary course of business between parties within the Republic , to the promotion of goods and services that could lead to such transactions , and to the goods and services themselves after the transaction is completed .
<zu> The Bill further sets out the matters over which provincial consumer protection authorities have jurisdiction in respect of activities occurring or application by per-sons carrying on business exclusively within their provinces , including issuing , on behalf of the Commission , of compliance notices ;
<zu> Provisions that seek to limit the suppliers liability must be specifically and conspicuously brought to the attention of the consumer , as outlined in clause 49 .
<zu> or the interaction concerns the supply or potential supply of goods or services to or at the direction of the consumer .
<zu> This includes franchise transactions or agreements as described in clause 5 .
<zu> Clause 14 establishes the consumers right to cancel a fixed-term agreement , limits the rights of suppliers to impose cancellation charges , and sets out rules governing the expiring of such agreements .
<zu> It provides that consumers have a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are intended , of good quality , in good working order , free of defects , and useable and durable for a reasonable period of time .
<zu> Currently contracts are regulated in terms of the common law .
<zu> Any repairs or maintenance cost above the original estimate has to be authorised by the consumer .
<zu> Consumers have to be informed and provided with the identity of the agents or person and informed of their right to rescind the agreement during the cooling-off period .
<zu> In terms of clause 44 , the consumer has the right to assume , and it is an implied term of every transaction , that the supplier or lessor has legal right to sell or lease the goods for full title of the goods to pass to the consumer .
<zu> Such a register would allow consumers to pre-emptively block direct marketing approaches .
<zu> Clause 9 sets out a small number of well-defined , long-standing and widely accepted commercial practices that allow differential treatment of consumers of a particular sex , age or gender , and states that those practices are not to be construed as unfair discrimination , if the conduct is reasonable .
<zu> Accredited consumer protection groups may also enforce consumer rights by commencing or undertaking any lawful act to protect the interests of a consumer individually or a group of consumers collectively in any matter or before any forum contemplated in the Bill ;
<zu> If two prices are displayed for the same goods , the lowest has to be charged .
<zu> a user of the goods or a recipient or beneficiary of the services ;
<zu> Clause 32 outlines standards to be adhered to when suppliers engage in direct marketing .
<zu> In addition to their jurisdiction to hear a matter initiated directly by a consumer , the courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals against Tribunal decisions , and may order suppliers to alter or discontinue certain practices , award damages against suppliers for collective injury to all or a class of consumers , to be paid to any person on any terms that the court might decide .
<zu> In addition , there is a general prohibition against consumers being subjected to unfair discrimination when they are entering into a transaction or agreement , and in all aspects of the conduct of the supplier towards the consumer in the course of the transaction .
<zu> The Bill identifies the following elements that make a transaction a consumer transaction , and thus bringing it within the scope of the Bill if it is an interaction or agreement to interact between a consumer and supplier in the ordinary course of the suppliers business , including in terms of any public regulation ;
<zu> If a complaint is made to the Commission , it will investigate , and may make a referral to the Tribunal , which may resolve the matter by making certain orders as contemplated in clause 75 .
<zu> notice on how to inhibit any risk associated with the use of goods , and to remedy or mitigate the effects , and provide for the safe disposal of the goods .
<zu> Under certain circumstances , as described in clause 21 , goods or services delivered to or performed for consumers may be regarded as unsolicited , in which case the con-sumer has no obligation to pay for them , and the return of the goods to the supplier is at the suppliers own risk and expense .
<zu> The Bill would hold suppliers accountable to consumers for any money or other property belonging to the consumer , but held by the supplier under any agreement , including advance payments for services to be supplied at a later date .
<zu> However , this does not apply to used goods or immovable property .
<zu> If a complaint arises in an industry in which a statutory ombud scheme is in place , the consumer must pursue a resolution through that scheme before making a complaint to the Commission .
<zu> Cause 60 creates a framework for industry codes to be developed , establishing schemes of product safety monitoring and , if needed , product recall .
<zu> This Part aims to safeguard the safety of consumers and to establish a regime of product liability , irrespective of negligence on the part of anyone in the supply chain , which currently does not exist in South Africa .
<zu> The Commission would have authority to order an investigation and recall of any dangerous or defective products covered by any such industry code .
<zu> If a complaint under this Part is directed to the Commission , it will be referred to the equality court .
<zu> there is an exchange of consideration ;
<zu> Right to privacy
<zu> The Bill provides for a general right for consumers to receive goods that are of good quality and free from defects , as described in clause 55 .
<zu> However , an exception is allowed where the consumer has been expressly informed of the condition of the goods and has expressly agreed to buy them in that particular state .
<zu> The dti believes that having informed and active consumers will enhance market and price competition .
<zu> Any printed information , document or notice that the Bill requires a supplier to pro-duce , provide or deliver to a consumer must satisfy the plain language requirements of clause 22 .
<zu> The use of a threshold will mean that the protection of the Bill will extend to small shop-keepers and other businesses , when they make routine or minor purchases for the purpose of their business . However , despite those exceptions , clauses 60 and 61 , which deal with unsafe goods , will apply to all goods introduced to the market , even if they were the subject of an exempt transaction .
