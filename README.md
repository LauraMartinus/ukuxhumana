# ukuxhumana

"Ukuxhumana" means "Communicate" in Zulu. This project is aimed at exploring ideas for using Neural Machine Translation for Low-resource languages - In particular, for the Bantu languages of Africa.

The translation.py runs a simple seq2seq model to perform the translation. This model does not perform well and was used as a way to learn how TF implements seq2seq
