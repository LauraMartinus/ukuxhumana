Ward Committees should establish a structured process whereby they meet regularly with their ward councillor to keep the councillor informed about community issues , through Ward Committee meetings , and by making sure that regular meetings are held to keep the public up to date on council issues .
For example , if a member or group from the community approaches the Ward Committee for assistance and the members of the committee feel that that particular group ' has no place in this community ' this will impact on the way the group or person is treated and in particular how their issue is treated .
I would like to appeal to every Pula Imvula reader - use the land that you have available this year to be best of your ability - take your soil samples , fertilise correctly , use the best seed that you can afford and remember to control the weeds as they are your enemy .
