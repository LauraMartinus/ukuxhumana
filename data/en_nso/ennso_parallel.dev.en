﻿This situation was reversed only with the advent of democracy in 1994 and the Constitutional provisions on official multlingualism. 
which stresses multilingualism as an extension of cultural diversity and an integral part of building a non-racial South Africa. 
A persons language is in many ways a second skin: a natural possession of every normal human being, 
Principles 
The National Language Policy Framework is based on the outcome of our consultation processes, 
Section 6 and contain language-related provisions for national and provincial governments, whereby government departments must use at least two of the official languages. 
The underlying principle is to retain the learners home language for learning and teaching, but to encourage learners to acquire additional languages as well. 
This resulted in language inequality, and the dominance of English and Afrikaans 
SECTION 4 
Promoting multilingualism in South Africa requires efforts that do not discount the knowledge that exists in societies where indigenous official languages are prominent. 
SECTION 2 
South African Qualifications Authority 
Section 6 of the Constitution requires mechanisms to be put in place to develop these indigenous languages. 
This will be facilitated by the use and involvement of communities as participants in the processes of language development. 
Approach 
All these practices engendered the corollary status of the indigenous languages and language varieties of the African people 
To promote linguistic diversity further, section 6 provides for the establishment of the Pan South African Language Board to promote multilingualism 
It is through language that we function as human beings in an ever-changing world. 
The right to use the official languages of our choice has therefore been recognised in our Bill of Rights, 
SECTION 2: KEY ELEMENTS OF THE POLICY 
It is in this spirit that the promotion of all 11 official languages of our country, as provided for in the Constitution, takes centre stage in the policy. 
This policy framework must therefore cater adequately for the harmonisation of language policy 
and subsequently the establishment of the Republic of South Africa and the apartheid regime, government language policy and the power elite failed to recognise South Africas linguistic diversity. 
FOREWORD BY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND 
Recognising that languages are resources to maximise knowledge, expertise and full participation in the political and socioeconomic domains; 
Section 9 protects against unfair discrimination on the grounds of language,

Section 6 of the Constitution provides the principal legal framework for multilingualism, the development of the official languages and the promotion of respect and tolerance for South Africas linguistic diversity. 
This Policy Framework also takes into account that we are faced with the challenge of globalisation and that our indigenous languages should be part of the rapidly expanding technological environment. 
and political recognition to hitherto disadvantaged language groups on the basis of the expressed needs of communities and interest groups. 
Scope 
The approach recognises the following:

After eight years of democracy, South Africa has now arrived at a crucial point in its history. 
Final Draft November 2002 
Principles 
The 11 official languages are isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu and siSwati ; Sesotho, Sepedi and Setswana ; Tshivenda, Xitsonga, English and Afrikaans. 
TECHNOLOGY 
A striking characteristic of multilingualism in South Africa is the fact that several indigenous languages are spoken across provincial borders; shared by speech communities from different provinces. 
TECHNOLOGY, DR B S NGUBANE 
promote the equitable use of the 11 official languages; 
on the grounds that their usage includes about 98 of the total population. 
The Constitution and related legislation clearly advocate the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa. 
The language policy is based on the following principles: 
Historical context 
Since the first occupation of South Africa by the Dutch in 1652, through successive periods of British rule, the Union of South Africa, 
There is currently a strong awareness of the need to intensify efforts to develop the previously marginalised indigenous languages and to promote multilingualism 
It takes into account the broad acceptance of linguistic diversity, social justice, the principle of equal access to public services and programmes, and respect for language rights. 
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE POLICY 
South Africa is therefore a multilingual country.

measures to regulate and monitor the use of disadvantaged indigenous languages. 
I am particularly proud that, after a thorough process of consultation, we are finally in a position to announce a framework for a language policy for South Africa. 
To date management of linguistic diversity in post-apartheid South Africa has been made problematic by the lack of a clearly defined language policy, 
The Policy Framework not only initiates a fresh approach to multilingualism in South Africa, but strongly encourages the utilisation of the indigenous languages as official languages in order to foster and promote national unity.

This Policy Framework also takes cognisance of the fact that the value of our languages is largely determined by their economic, social and political usage.

SECTION 1 
South African Sign Language 
This step was essential in view of the lack of tolerance for linguistic diversity and the resultant multilingualism is a costly problem approach evident in some sectors of our society, 
I sincerely trust that all South Africans will embrace this National Language Policy Framework as their own. 
I believe that collectively we have to ensure that the policy becomes a reality in our lives, 
BUILDING HUMAN CAPACITY 
Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa 
This is the finalisation of a process that started in 1995, when I appointed the Language Plan Task Group to advise me on a framework for a coherent language policy and plan. 
LiEP deals with such matters as language of learning and teaching in public schools, school curricula, 
and the growing criticism from language stakeholders of the tendency towards unilingualism in South Africa. 
Pan South African Language Board 
Legislative context 
Department of Arts and Culture 
if South Africans are to be liberated from undue reliance on the utilisation of non-indigenous languages as the dominant, official languages of the state. 
therefore gave rise to a hierarchy of languages, the inequality of which that reflected the structures of racial and class inequality that characterised South African society. 
To promote multilingualism this policy determines the use of different languages in government structures as follows: 
SECTION 3: BUILDING HUMAN CAPACITY 
Government publications: A publication programme of functional multilingualism should be followed by national government departments in those cases that do not require publication in all 11 official languages. 
Where the effective and stable operation of government at any level requires comprehensive communication of information 
If necessary, every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as interpreting where practically possible. 
The infrastructure required to operationalise the policy will be put in place. 
taking into account their regional circumstances, and the needs and preferences of communities, as stated in the Constitution. 
It will be expedient to engage language specialists to assist the process of developing functional multilingual programmes through research and the dissemination of findings. 
, it must be published in all 11 official languages and, in the provinces, in all the official languages prescribed in the Province. 
Scope 
The scope or provisions of the policy are as follows: 
Other implementation mechanisms that will be operationalised are a Language Code of Conduct for Public Servants, the establishment of the SA Language Practitioners Council, 
In collaboration with PanSALB, the Department of Arts and Culture will monitor progress and report at specified intervals to all relevant authorities. 
written communication with the public; and international communication where applicable. 
A principle of rotation must be applied when selecting languages for publishing government documents in the Nguni and Sotho groups. 
This will include the establishment of language units in all national departments and in the provinces to manage ― 
Regarding government publications, implementation will be phased in flexibly and pragmatically by government structures over a period of at least three years. 
SECTION 4: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES 
English; and 
A community-based approach to the promotion of multilingualism is the most viable one, given South Africas highly pluralistic society. 
will also impact on the scope of the activities of the National Language Service . 
Deleted: - 
Capacity building in the identified areas of language facilitation will take place in close collaboration with service providers such as tertiary institutions offering SAQA-accredited programmes 
The selection of languages will be made as follows: 
Afrikaans. 
All oral communication must take place in the preferred official language of the target audience. 
Government structures will have time to plan their budgets by gradually increasing allocations 
The areas of terminography and terminology will likewise be affected. 
Tshivenda; 
The advantage of the gradual phasing in methodology is that departments will be able to develop capacity incrementally and manage the implementation process more effectively. 
In promoting multilingualism provinces will formulate their policies in line with the guidelines contained in this Policy Framework, 
over the MTEF period and planning operations in line with the resources required for successful policy implementation. 
Government will encourage, and where necessary support, private enterprises to develop and implement their own language policies in accordance with the national language policy framework. 
a Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa, a strategy for the development of the previously marginalised languages and an HLT Strategy. 
The increase in translation work will require accelerated development of terminology in the official languages and of a National Termbank that is accessible to both government and freelance language practitioners. 
Supporting the development of human resources required for successful implementation of multilingualism; 
Upon determination of the language use and preference of communities, local governments must, in broad consultation with their communities, develop, publicise and implement a multilingual policy. 
must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as translation and/or interpreting where practically possible. 
Monitoring mechanisms for assuring the quality of translation and editing services will be developed. 
Policy reviews will be conducted regularly and recommendations will be made for amendments where necessary so that budgets can be adjusted accordingly. 
Provided that where practically possible no person will be prevented from using the language of his or her preference. 
All government structures, as well as institutions exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of legislation are bound by this Language Policy Framework. 
The increased need for the services of professional language practitioners will require further skills training. 
The NLS will also be responsible for coordinating the development of training programmes for translators, editors and interpreters, and establishing operational guidelines on quality issues. 
and courses in language practice, translation and editing, interpreting, language planning, terminography and lexicography. 
The core of translation expertise in these languages will have to be expanded both in government departments and in the private sector, i.e. freelance language practitioners such as translators, editors and interpreters will have to be developed. 
International communication: Government communication at the international level will normally be in English or ad hoc in the preferred language of the country concerned. 
The availability of Human Language Technology applications for the indigenous languages will play a major supporting role in language facilitation activities. 
intra and interdepartmental oral communication 
Regulating the language facilitation profession, i.e. translation, interpreting and terminology development, through development and appropriate legislation; 
Working language/language of record: By consensus, each government structure must agree on a working language ; 
There must be a decentralised and participatory approach to language planning and policy implementation, which harnesses technical expertise for the transfer of knowledge and skills. 
Xitsonga; 
It will be necessary to conduct policy reviews at reasonable intervals in order to monitor progress towards a fully multilingual South African society. 
2.4.6.2. Communication with members of the public: For official correspondence purposes, the language of the citizens choice must be used. 
The size options for language units will be determined and skills training in this area will be prioritised after the number of official languages to be used 
Units consisting of four or more professional staff will require clerks. 
by facilitating training for language unit staff in language planning activities and support of the work programmes of these units. 
The NLS will be required to coordinate the management of policy implementation 
Local governments will determine the language use and preferences of their communities within an enabling provincial language policy framework. 
At least one from the Sotho group ; 
The progressive phasing in of the implementation of the policy in the short, medium and long term is the preferred strategy at all levels. 
The establishment of language units in each national government department and in each province 
Facilitating cooperation and the sharing of responsibilities among SADC member states will accelerate language development. 
The implementation of the language policy willincrease the demand for translation and editing work and interpreting services, especially in the indigenous languages. 
For the purposes of conducting meetings or performing specific tasks every effort 
as a matter of right as required: provided that in the case of provincial legislatures, regional circumstances will determine the language to be used. 
Additional government responsibilities regarding the implementation of the national language policy are as follows: 
At least one from the Nguni group ; 
In cases where government documents will not be made available in all 11 official languages, national government departments must publish documents simultaneously in at least six languages.

HOW TO SUBMIT A PETITION IN PARLIAMENT

The petition will be tabled in Parliament and referred to the Committee that deal with the issue raised in your petition. 
Petitions are classified into two categories, namely special petitions and public or general petitions. 
A special petition is when an individual makes a specific request or asks for personal relief from the State, 
Parliament has developed a number of mechanisms to promote public involvement in the law-making process and broaden access to a people's Parliament.

Men have an important role to play in achieving gender equality in South African society. 
South Africa is part of several African programmes 
Women's representation in the National Assembly has increased to 45. 
The Bill of Rights guarantees equal treatment for all South Africans. 
Women should participate in lawmaking because the implementation of legislation and government policies has an impact on their daily lives. 
Men and women have an equal and significant role to play in the transformation of gender relations in society. 
INSPIRED BY PEOPLE 
The South African Constitution provides a framework for the promotion of gender equality, and therefore the participation of women in lawmaking. 
Further Reading: 
e.g. the Southern African Development Community protocol on gender and development. 
How people vote in the elections determines the composition of both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN LAWMAKING? 
More and more men are taking a stand against violence against women and children. 
Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth, Children and Persons with Disabilities 
South Africa ranks third in the world in terms of representation of women in Parliament. 
This pamphlet is available in all the official languages of South Africa 
in order to influence how Parliament is made up, and how the institution prioritises the development of women. 
Women are traditionally the poorest group in South Africa and more likely to be underemployed or unemployed. 
to consolidate the government's activities in developing and protecting vulnerable people in our society. 
They can also become involved in organising and working for their chosen party and being elected into its structures. 
PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN? 
Women make up a substantial proportion of voters and can exercise the right to vote 
The majority of women lack economic empowerment. 
If an issue is of great public interest, a Committee in the National Assembly or the National Council of Provinces may decide to hold public hearings or call for submissions. 
It prohibits unfair discrimination on the basis of race, gender or sex.

Women have risen to top positions in this way. 
WHAT ROLE CAN MEN PLAY? 
LAWMAKING?   WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FACING WOMEN IN PARTICIPATING IN 
In addition to the provisions made in the Constitution, 
These include, among others, the Commission on Gender Equality and the South African Human Rights Commission. 
The fourth Parliament has established the following Committees that deal directly with issues relating to women: 
HOW WELL ARE WOMEN CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT? 
There are many challenges that prevent women from playing a full and meaningful role, and the biggest one is poverty. 
Select Committee on Women, Youth, Children and Persons with Disabilities 
Poverty is a struggle faced by many South African women, especially rural women. 
The Constitution makes provision for institutions that support democracy, as well as for the participation of women. 
Produced by Parliamentary Communication Services 
There are different ways in which this can be done. 
The public has a right to attend committee meetings and to participate in Public Hearings. 
The Constitution contains several provisions that advance gender equality. 
Despite women constituting the majority of the South African population, women are still in the minority when it comes to decision making. 
South Africa has committed to gender equality through its ratification of international conventions 
The public can inform a Portfolio or Select Committee of their views or on an issue it is debating. 
South Africa has also adopted legislation to specifically address gender equality. 
Furthermore, HIV/ AIDS affects a far greater proportion of women, especially young women in their childbearing years. 
IMPORTANT CONTACT INFORMATION 
Our growing democracy has improved women's access to political power and decision-making. 
A new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities has also been created 
In order for women to fully participate in lawmaking, women's access to basic services should be improved. 
WHAT ARE THE KEY STRUCTURES FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN 
No society can be truly emancipated until its women and men are free and equal, and to this end, men and women bear a shared responsibility. 
HOW CAN WOMEN PARTICIPATE IN LAWMAKING? 
Access to basic services such as education, water and welfare has been influenced by unequal gender, race and class relations. 
WOMEN AND PARLIAMENT 
The Bill of Rights emphasises that measures must be taken to promote the achievement of equality in all spheres of society. 
More importantly, research has shown that when women take part in decision making, it leads to an increased focus and allocation of resources that improve the quality of life of all. 
Women can participate in lawmaking by voting for the political party they think can best represent their views and concerns in Parliament. 
1 An increase in the participation of women in lawmaking can by extension lead to an improvement in access to basic services such as housing, education and welfare. 
Women constitute more than half of the South African population and therefore the voices of women must be included when decisions are taken and laws are made. 
The first and most important way women can be involved in Parliament is during elections. 
Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth, Children and Persons with Disabilities 
The national election gives all people over the age of 18 the right to vote for the party of their choice. 
such as the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Platform of Action, which was established by the Beijing Conference on Women. 
The South African Constitution says that there must be public access to and involvement in Parliament and its processes. 
LAWMAKING? 
The challenge is to make the rights accessible to all women. 
The inclusion of women in decision making is a fundamental human right. 
Men must influence other men to change attitudes, and to respect women. 
﻿Team Leader : Janine Zagel
The PMP embarked on this project to give voice to the voiceless and to afford women within marginalised communities as well as minority groups an opportunity to engage with one another and the broader Parliamentary community on what Democracy has meant to them .
District Municipalities
Bring communities closer together through this Quilting project by creating opportunities for women to share their views on matters of policy and how it has an impact on their lives .
Stimulate and deepen debate amongst South Africans around issues such as Democracy and Nation Building .
In the same way this project recognises and encourages the diversity of views and opinions amongst South African women , but also encourages them to recognise the interdependence that is necessary for us forging a common future in our quest for unity in diversity .
The publicity campaign will further be supported by strategically placing posters in different public venues across the province .

Through this endeavour different skills and knowledge will be transferred , shared and exchanged , affording the legislatures and local government structures an opportunity to develop their own framework for future projects focussed on nation building .
In addition , a selection of the artworks from each province will be used for the production of a quilt that will be permanently installed in Parliament .
Another important outcome of this project is that an analysis will be done of the stories written by the women and used as submissions to Parliamentary Portfolio Committees .
The concept is based on the approach of selecting random groups of women in targeted geographic areas to write stories about issues and experiences related to their everyday lives .

By definition it is made up of a large number of pieces , which in itself has its own unique characteristics , but the beauty of it lies in how this kaleidoscope of patterns and colours combine to represent a unified picture or image - it is thus the interdependence and the interrelations of the different sections that inform the whole .
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
A two week publicity campaign will be arranged by the PMP to support the provincial campaign and ensure that maximum publicity is generated for the project and the Exhibitions in particular .

PROJECT/TASK TEAM
The general public
By initiating this country wide quilting project in collaboration with the Provincial Legislatures and Local Government Structures , we aim to provide an opportunity for South African women to be more visible and demand their rightful place within society .
A harsh reality that South Africans continue to face is the great numbers of women who still find themselves marginalised , poverty stricken and abused and not fully integrated within the support structures of society .
PARLIAMENTARY MILLENNIUM PROGRAMMEROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
It also commits itself to exploring and expressing the relationship between society and creativity wherein women would translate their stories into a work of art .
The thoughts , dreams and aspirations of these women will be shared with other South Africans , as we anticipate that the artwork will be on permanent display in the various Provincial Legislatures , as well as be made available to local communities through exhibitions in public spaces in the provinces .
This project forms part of the Inter Legislature Exchange , a broader collaboration with Legislatures and Local Government structures in each Province .The benefit of this collaboration is that the Provincial and Local Structures will each take ownership of this nation building initiative in their respective province .

These written stories are finally translated into a piece of artwork that is reflective of the personal stories and experiences of these women .

The groups of participating women all attend workshops , facilitated by the facilitators of CAS , and are guided through a process of conceptualisation where they engage with other women and facilitators to discuss their ideas and opinions on how they feel about certain events that have occurred in their lives .
The stories will be clustered into themes , and issues will be extracted from the themes to give a clear impression of the kind of challenges that women in this country continue to confront .
It affords the PMP , the Legislatures and Local Government the opportunity to broaden the scope and reach of projects aimed at making South Africans aware of issues related to nation building and the deepening of our democracy .

PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES
This quilting campaign is therefore of utmost importance as inputs given by the women will be fed through the policy making process .
The frames for the Northern and Eastern Cape have been delivered to the Legislatures and the artwork for the Western Cape and Mpumalanga is close to completion .
The aim of this Project is to use the art of quilting to encourage women to express their opinions , thoughts and feelings using the theme What Democracy means to me and A day I will never forget .
﻿using the theme What Democracy means to me and A day I will never forget . 
Create Africa South , a Durban based organisation , the Provincial Legislatures and Local Government structures , have embarked on Amazwi Abesifazane , a National Quilting Campaign . 
By initiating this country wide quilting project in collaboration with the Provincial Legislatures and Local Government Structures , 
- it is thus the interdependence and the interrelations of the different sections that inform the whole . 
we aim to provide an opportunity for South African women to be more visible and demand their rightful place within society . 
but the beauty of it lies in how this kaleidoscope of patterns and colours combine to represent a unified picture or image 
The concept is based on the approach of selecting random groups of women in targeted geographic areas to write stories about issues and experiences related to their everyday lives . 
The aim of this Project is to use the art of quilting to encourage women to express their opinions , thoughts and feelings 
Bring communities closer together through this Quilting project by creating opportunities for women to share their views on matters of policy and how it has an impact on their lives . 
and are guided through a process of conceptualisation where they engage with other women and facilitators to discuss their ideas and opinions on how they feel about certain events that have occurred in their lives . 
Large numbers of women are still unable to read and write 
A quilt is in many ways reflective of the notion of perspective . 
It also commits itself to exploring and expressing the relationship between society and creativity wherein women would translate their stories into a work of art . 
and therefore incapable at times of contributing effectively towards the political , social and economic development of this country , alive with opportunities , freedom and change . 
A harsh reality that South Africans continue to face is the great numbers of women who still find themselves marginalised , poverty stricken and abused and not fully integrated within the support structures of society . 
Tap into a very rich source of knowledge and wisdom that exists throughout communities in our country . 
These written stories are finally translated into a piece of artwork that is reflective of the personal stories and experiences of these women . 
forging a common future in our quest for unity in diversity . 
Stimulate and deepen debate amongst South Africans around issues such as Democracy and Nation Building . 
The groups of participating women all attend workshops , facilitated by the facilitators of CAS , 
The rationale behind the Voices of Women Quilting Campaign is that we attempt to : 
In the same way this project recognises and encourages the diversity of views and opinions amongst South African women , 
The final project is presented with the photo of the participant , the written story as well as the embroidered artwork as a beautifully framed portrait . 
By definition it is made up of a large number of pieces , which in itself has its own unique characteristics , 
For these reasons , The Parliamentary Millennium Programme in collaboration with 
Encourage participation amongst marginalised and minority groups , where women can share their stories and experiences within society . 
but also encourages them to recognise the interdependence that is necessary for us 
Where participants are unable to write , a coordinator writes their story in the first person . 
The Campaign was launched in Douglas in the Northern Cape in August 2007 to coincide with National Womens month . 
as well as minority groups an opportunity to engage with one another and the broader Parliamentary community on what Democracy has meant to them . 
This was followed by a workshop in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape in September and the final workshop for 2007 was held in the Western Cape . 
In essence , their voices will not only be on display , but will be heard by those responsible for legislation .

PROGRESS TO DATE : 
This quilting campaign is therefore of utmost importance as inputs given by the women will be fed through the policy making process . 
The preparation phase for the installation of Provincial Exhibitions is underway and the submissions are in the final drafting phases . 
Four workshops have been completed . 
District Municipalities 
This project forms part of the Inter Legislature Exchange , a broader collaboration with Legislatures and Local Government structures in each Province . 
Another important outcome of this project is that an analysis will be done of the stories written by the women and used as submissions to Parliamentary Portfolio Committees . 
The stories will be clustered into themes , and issues will be extracted from the themes to give a clear impression of the kind of challenges that women in this country continue to confront . 
affording the legislatures and local government structures an opportunity to develop their own framework for future projects focussed on nation building . 
The thoughts , dreams and aspirations of these women will be shared with other South Africans , 
Participants 
and reach of projects aimed at making South Africans aware of issues related to nation building and the deepening of our democracy .

﻿But we should not take this for granted . 
within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible , 
As the Honourable Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; 
A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration . 
It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union , 
With all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , 
Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , 
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves . 
and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency . 
Critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union . 
Further , after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , 
to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , 
and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength . 
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions 
But we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies 
to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government . 
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women , 
and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . 
premised on accelerating the development of our region . 
As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations . 
and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010 . 
as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all . 
we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign . 
There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard . 
introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small , medium and micro-enterprises ; 
we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels . 
bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , 
I am confident that , under the leadership of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Investment South Africa , Tourism South Africa 
If anything , the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants . 
These global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup , 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson , When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament , 
Two such issues deserve brief mention . 
The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , 
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates , complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control 
Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , 
Firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging . 
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years . 
and security , further give life to the Victims Charter , pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders , and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . 
These are : 
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues 
and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual , 
and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime . 
and access by all households to these services . 
we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , 
Further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement . 
In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , 
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP ; 
developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent . 
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning . 
but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime . 
and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment . 
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners . 
and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa to provide micro-credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers 
Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , 
We are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments   and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives . 
Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge . 
Over the past year , we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face . 
We had an opportunity , on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter . 
We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 ,   train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease 
and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round . 
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya , Chad , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western Sahara , 
The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth 
and those with high eviction rates , and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5 per year , and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up ; 
speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition , better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support , 
This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China . 
We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda . 
Secondly , by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities . 
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , 
and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . 
as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme . 
of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills .   Indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 
including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , 
At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies . 
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week . 
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . 
We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , 
Thus , as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us 
Accordingly , we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements 
Of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , 
and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households . 
acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives 
In short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address . 
Among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , 
and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors . 
enhancing employment search capability , 
and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the Criminal Justice System , 
so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided . 
This we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels . 
Working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National anticorruption Programme is adopted , 
Our focus , in promoting the African Agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , Nepad . 
The second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose . 
and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter . 
sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements 
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly . 
we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by Cabinet . 
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens . 
bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity . 
new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system . 
Next year , South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001 . 
the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60 , thus benefiting about half a million men ; 
but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy . 
To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done . 
and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be . 
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments . 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2008 
For this , we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as 
Honourable Members 
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson 
What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course ! 
In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated . 
and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme . 
In this regard , in the spirit of Business Unusual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a 
Among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment . 
The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters . 
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ; 
and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment . 
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision . 
Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 . 
Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations 
we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums , the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership , 
Having said all that I have said , I come back to the question : what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008 ! 
efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies . 
Thank you . 
Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites 
The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism . 
As such , in the spirit of Business Unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households 
We will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council . 
Côte dIvoire , Somalia , the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability . 
with emphasis on providing training and markets , including linking them up with established outlets ; 
As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation . 
What is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution . 
as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans . 
This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 . 
resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates . 
We will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees . 
Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , 
Thirdly , recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizens life , 
respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements . 
We are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad , 
What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , 
the Non-Aligned Movement , the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement . 
This includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card . 
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , 
and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed . 
I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― 
We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the countrys war against poverty , in pursuit of socioeconomic inclusion . 
the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided . 
We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments . 
improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , 
we shall by the end of March this year , interact with Parliament on legislation 
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , 
Accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality . 
the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the Legal Aid Board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums . 
Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS . 
Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue , 
Honourable Members 
Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations 
Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management . 
with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed , and increasing the number of caregivers . 
﻿In this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime .
Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation .
For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society .
In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study , the National Income Dynamics Study .
expanding access to Early Childhood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme ;
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process .
We should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .
having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings ;
continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police , and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years , and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced ;bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology , and ensure the optimum utilisation of the fingerprint database ― indeed , many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems ;
At the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system .
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens .
start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services , especially in respect of border control , and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard ;
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service , in order massively to reduce case backlogs ;
As such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda .
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational ;
We are proud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba .
We hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security .
What has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants .
Since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better .
With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a State Diamond Trader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers .
It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity .
The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security .
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ;
Further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency .
intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime , building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cash-in-transit heists , drug trafficking and poaching of game and abalone ;
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year :
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing , tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ;
Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent .
develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation , agriculture and agro-processing , the white goods sector , creative industries , community and social services and pharmaceuticals .
expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries , increasing the number of training institutions , improving the quality of training , and instituting a bursary system ;
These centres will be established in areas identified by government .
speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project , implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the Bus Rapid Transit System in the Metros and recapitalisation of Metrorail : and in this regard , let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SANTACO will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project , and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly ;
This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country .
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards , remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions ;
What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC .
Compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed .
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial .
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions .
ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency , SEDA ;
With regard to communications , I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers .
intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work , including a youth cooperatives programme , and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities ― and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , big and small , which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative ;
start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers .
This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 .
And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure , improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented .
All these efforts , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security .
We are not there yet .
a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings , death , disability and unemployment benefits .
In addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years .
The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech .
As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country .
In addition , Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector .
After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided .
These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year .
Thank you .
continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system ;
As the Honourable Members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools .
In this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year :
take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ;
In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf .
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution ;
continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals , and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers ;
We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing .
I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative , working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team , concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system .
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres , including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system ;
a wage subsidy for low-wage employees , possibly directed at first entrants into the job market , especially young people ;
A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa .
We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ;
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in India , Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as Japan , Europe and North America .
We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible .
We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs .
Starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions .
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include :
Rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system .
Issued by : The Presidency February 2007
improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating .
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace .
We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development .
In this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention .
The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries .
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings .
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed , we will :
This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development .
In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year :
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods .
And so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share .
process the Companies Bill , adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday , as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ;
speeding up of the construction of low-cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to handle finances , piloting of the Land Use Management Bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the much-delayed agreement with the private sector on low-cost housing are finalised ;
Because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things :
further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership .
We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks , informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Agenda , which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public , and strengthening the Ward Committees ― 80 of which have been established across the country .
In this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment .
This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people .
implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections ;
and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements .
We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition .
develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes , including capital goods in ICT , transport and energy : with regard to energy , we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation , natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy .
In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever .
continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of TB , road accidents and violent crime .
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met .
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society .
Quite clearly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy .
I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums .
Honourable Members ;
In the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include :
finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning , in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy ;
Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia .
Just over a month ago , South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
We should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom .
The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans .
ensuring the implementation , without further delay , of measures to reduce the cost of medicines ;
implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations ;
In this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 .
We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole .
conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ;
These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution .
Critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation .
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification .
Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation .
As we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals .
The principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity .
We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront .
The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies .
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ;
Similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes .
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ;Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
However , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , Côte dIvoire and Somalia .
One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations .
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible .
complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ;
We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the Regulatory Impact Assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities .
in the Northwest Province , the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50 ;
The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros .
We must act to change this situation .
But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society .
It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February .
Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new .
This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty .
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented .
while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government ;
But no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised .
This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes .
For instance , in September last year , 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers ;
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres ;
Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region .
We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion , including the comprehensive and integrated anti-poverty strategy we have mentioned , as well as address issues pertaining to national unity , value systems and identity .
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy .
Honourable Members ;
﻿Two such issues deserve brief mention .
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya , Chad , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia , the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability .
We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the countrys war against poverty , in pursuit of socioeconomic inclusion .
I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her .
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development
As such , in the spirit of Business Unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households .
Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums , the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement .
I am certain that the South African Football Association , our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud .
We are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad , developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent .
My answer to this question is a definite No !
In this regard , I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American , Cynthia Carroll , when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week , on Tuesday , February 5 .
What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course !
Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place .
An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development .
We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda .
In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream .
the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60 , thus benefiting about half a million men ;
However , like all the Honourable Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow .
Mr Jacob Zuma , Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress ;
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens .
Accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco .
It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry .
The second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose .
This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today .
All these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans .
The sense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy , and poverty eradication
I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 .
Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme .
Further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement .
An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not .
There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state .
We must ensure that we sustain this approach .
In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme .
Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom .
The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people .
However , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity .
I will also shortly announce a team of Energy Champions consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges .
All these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin .
We will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council .
I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all .
She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today .
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ;
The main categories of these priorities are :
Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS .
Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge .
However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient .
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ;
Thus , as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government .
What she expects as her birthday present is the truth .
Chairperson of SALGA , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ;
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service ;
We are taking steps to enhance Eskoms maintenance capacity .
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard .
Heads of our Security Services ;
We acknowledge , both among the Honourable Members and our guests , the many founders of the United Democratic Front , 25 years ago .
However , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard .
We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects .
These are :
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period .
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years .
For this , we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency .
They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity .
As I was preparing this Address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow .
intensifying the Expanded Public Works Programme which , by surpassing the set targets , has shown potential to absorb more entrants : this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure , doubling the number of children enrolled in Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed , and increasing the number of caregivers .
I speak here today in the presence of my mother , Epainette Mbeki , MaMofokeng , who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei , among whom she has lived for many decades .
As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations .
We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment .
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ;and where possible , some projects will be accelerated .
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments .
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates , complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security , further give life to the Victims Charter , pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders , and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
Indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people .
But we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be .
They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices .
I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January .
You will ask whether I agree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future !
Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year .
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning .
And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today .
We will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees .
And so I quote these words :
We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry .
Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting , solar water heating and geyser load management in households , including housing standards for all new houses and developments .
The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength .
I say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream .
We are a minerals resource economy .We must therefore continue to support the mining industry .
In this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin .
I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year .
Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency .
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
Our focus , in promoting the African Agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , Nepad .
The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters .
If anything , the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants .
This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location .
At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies .
While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous South Africa .
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ;
These global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup , bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity .
This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding .
Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ;
It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only .
There are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take .
People of South Africa :
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly .
Next year , South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001 .
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women , with emphasis on providing training and markets , including linking them up with established outlets ;
Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year .
To make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities .
Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters .
They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month .
Governor of the Reserve Bank ;
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament ;
Over the past year , we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face .
The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― Business Unusual !
The details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the Power Conservation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published .
Madame Speaker and Chairperson , When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy .
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment .
But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― I hope relatively unscathed This is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions .
At the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability .
This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 .
But we should not take this for granted .
Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation .
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ;
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can .
speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition , better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support , and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa to provide micro-credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates , and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5 per year , and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up ;
Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution .
Among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient .
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
Happily , this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which , the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week .
The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest , that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people , but also to many others outside our borders .
Among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment .
What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies .
As the Honourable Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ;
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country .
They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings , Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency .
Issued by : The Presidency February 2008
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises .
Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States .
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners ;
I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided .
I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully .
Of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements .
These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another .
Honourable MembersHonourable Members
Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors .
Thirdly , recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by Cabinet .
introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small , medium and micro-enterprises ;
Indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity .
but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime .
Critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union .
In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric during the course of last week , GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf .
The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course .
The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans .
We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , Robert Sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , banishment and other forms of repression .
We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments .
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision .
Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term , the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities on which it must focus in a special way , using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue .
To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done .
Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned .
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections .
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates .
This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges .
As the Honourable Members know , she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster .
He suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel , A Tale of Two Cities .
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme .
Indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills .
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ;
Of course , I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament .
Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables .
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves .
This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police , the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes .
Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year .
and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed .
Among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the Legal Aid Board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums .
And precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity !
This must inspire Bafana Bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year .
At the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year .
And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil .
The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism .
It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union , within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible , premised on accelerating the development of our region .
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard .
Further , after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign .
They are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor .
Task teams are currently working in many areas .
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated .
We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman , representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include Nelson Mandela .
Having said all that I have said , I come back to the question : what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008 !
Working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National anticorruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented .
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people .
This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China .
This we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels .
As we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― Business Unusual !
Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan .
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008
We are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives .
In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol , Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint .
This includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card .
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation .
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ;
We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner , the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago .
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week .
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP ;
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid .
We had an opportunity , on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter .
In this regard , in the spirit of Business Unusual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system .
The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination .
We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-saving measures .
In this regard , R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy .
Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management .
The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 .
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary ;
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations .
We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services .
With all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels .
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners .
Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme .
In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 92 years old .
Thank you .
Working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing .Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained .
Secondly , by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities .
Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of Business Unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes .
This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end .
In the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round .
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency .
In short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address .
Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation .
Accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality .
More than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands !
As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation .
We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud .
Sure , the problems here are serious ;overcoming them will require ingenuity , especially in energy efficiency and energy saving , as well as the development of alternative power supplies .
Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual !
Cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right .
We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later .
Firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging .
I am confident that , under the leadership of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Investment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010 .
The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy .
Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the Criminal Justice System , we shall by the end of March this year , interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime .
Accordingly , we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter .
I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties .
As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge .
Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 .
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March .
Madame Speaker and ChairpersonAt the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all .
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided .
Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition will be intensified .
On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency .
﻿In this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom .
but also to put in place measures that would obviate a recurrence .
In the First Decade of Freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 .
I have walked that long road to freedom .
Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
These then are some of the advances that democracy has brought ;
And we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories .
These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy .
continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health Insurance ;
In the end , the challenge is as much about regulation ;
In education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ;
We are also heartened that research into HIV prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection .
Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability .
However , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves .
But beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity ― to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world .
continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way ;
Indeed , it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003 , the economy created about one-and-half million net new jobs ;
That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers .
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ;
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services .
But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday , the 7th and 8th of February respectively .
access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse ;
However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public .
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings , appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds , housing , financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment ;
Madam Deputy President ;
We do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy .
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition .
Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society .
Though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves .
On a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe :
In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate .
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy , preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency ;
In this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product . Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 .
Except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing .
This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime .
For instance , access to potable water has improved from 62 in 1996 to 88 in 2008 ;
This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports .
We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world .
Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO , which included : Strini Moodley , Professor Barney Pityana , Steve Biko , Onkgopotse Tiro , Harry Nengwekhulu , Themba Sono , Mapetla Mohapi , Mosioua Lekota , Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi .
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation .
Ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive .
All these are assignments for the coming period .
With regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves .
and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability .
but , hopefully , also with regard to political dialogue .
This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better .
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament , Traditional leaders ;
Government is painfully aware that abject poverty is still too widespread in our society ;
Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures ;
Fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men .
Thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations .
We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands .
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ;
This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds .
Indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African and Coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants .
This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda .
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production ;
And so , Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson , we should ask ourselves : how have our actions defined the path of South African societys evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy ;and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the 2004 democratic mandate !
We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China .
It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner .
Further , our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world ;
There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery .
In this regard , Honourable Members , I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society .
At the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas .
Comrades and friends ;
In addition , we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits .
We wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of Zambia , Ghana and the United States of America for elections the symbolism of which transcends the narrow boundaries of their nation-states .
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament ;
Secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes .
Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm leadership .
Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development .
On its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis .
In our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path .
We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face .
Chief Justice Langa ;
But we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ;
At the same time we will improve SADCs interaction with the Common Market of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community . These initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weaken the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the Southern African Customs Union .
But ours is a journey of hope and resilience .
And so , 15 years into our democracy , we can assert that the fear , the insecurity and the loathing that 100 years ago generated an exclusive and illusory peace among colonial masters , were not only unfounded ;
advancing equity , developing skills , creating economic opportunities and extending services ;
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections .
Giniel de Villiers and his team have won the Dakar Rally ;
The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes .
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate .
Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods .
Critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down .
They include Brian Bunting , Billy Nair , Ncumisa Kondlo , John Gomomo , Joe Nhlanhla , Cas Saloojee , John Schippers and Jan van Eck .
Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator , former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion .
In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth .
Just two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu .
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ;
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Childrens Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60 .
and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment .
Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage .
and crimes against women and children have not abated in any significant measure , is a matter of great concern .
It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management .
We are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable .
That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the United Nations , on the approach to negotiations in South Africa .
Combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects .
In a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy .
These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals .
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ;
It points to systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice system , from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders .
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed .
It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― our nation is in a good state .
This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africas wealth .
We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africas pursuit of excellence over the past year .
But let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nascent stages .
and we will be perfectly justified .
But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb .
The abiding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale , not only to stem the impact of the crisis ;
This improvement is mirrored in access to basic services ― a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in money-metric poverty .
Over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership .We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA ;
But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later .
Of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society .
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now .
On the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue .
Indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society .
Honourable Members ;
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ;
We may even say that , in a strange quirk of fate , many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past ;and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient .
In this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 .
HIV impacts most severely on young women .
In this regard , we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiros cousin , Pat Tlhagwana .
These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward .
A hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts .
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended .
Indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century .
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ;
We hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour !
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations .
In this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds .
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans .As we look back over the past fifteen years , I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary ;
and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion :
Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity .
The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans .
I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face .
but it is expanding all the time , with over 690 000 patients having been initiated on antiretroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme .
For inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them .
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society ;
to provide efficient , decent and equitable health care ;
The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards .
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands .
the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality .
Our democracy is healthy .Our democracy is healthy .
In this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly .
Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment .
We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems .
In this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance .
The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years .
It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former President Nelson Mandela , in his biography , Long Walk to Freedom :
and the level of inequality is too high .
as it is about consistent enforcement .
that we should indeed , in the words of the Freedom Charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture !
but from the point of view of government systems , we can draw solace from the fact that over 70 of cases of corruption reported in the media become public because government has detected the wrongdoing and is in fact acting against it .
Above all , I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today ― worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life .
And because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes .
Wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life .
What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis .
The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact .
Alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing .
Of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy .
However , we should not underestimate the challenges we face .
We believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system ;
Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports .
I have tried not to falter ;
intensifying the campaign to save energy , so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour , while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources ― recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change , resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing ;
Importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work .
It may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate ;
and South Africa stands ready to assist wherever we can .
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ;
Firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years .
In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale , the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students , and his peers .
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town February 2009
creating more jobs , better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment , public works programmes , sector partnerships and strategies , local procurement , small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives ;
95 of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility ;
On the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme .
Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation .
While the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward .
Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities .
and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the electorate .
Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu , brother of Kalushi , representing the Mahlangu family .
creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government , including national strategic planning ;
Thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants .
and an improvement in the number of pupils passing mathematics , to quote a few examples .
A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago .
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ;
Allow me , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves .
Indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate .
These include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors .
integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ;
implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country ;
While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million .
This , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state .
In this regard , we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book .
intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system , including better forensic capacity , rapid increase in the number of detectives , optimal utilisation of information and communications technology , and better management of the courts ;
As would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months , South Africa will use the privilege of chairing SADC to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion .
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ;Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ;
We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular .
Issued by : The Presidency February 2009
What , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade .
It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth .
The same challenges confront the private sector .
In this regard , we should salute the late President of the African National Congress , Oliver Reginald Tambo , for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country .
But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime .
In reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential .
We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population .
The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat .
Overall , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes .
I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President .
That depends on all of us ;and to that we can attach no price !
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress ;and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come .
Naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers .
The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description .
It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August , 1989 ― commonly known as the Harare Declaration .
In the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia and elsewhere .
strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability ;submitting the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development to Parliament ;
Secondly , although the reductions in poverty have been substantial , aggregate inequality increased during the 1990s .
I thank you .
As such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation .
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security ;
I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society .
Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms .
Governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided .
almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level ;
It is steadily growing stronger .
We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better .
but beyond this , that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary .
and sanitation .
We are truly heartened that , yesterday , the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government .
Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell .
This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure .
Violence against women and children is much too high .
While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion .
We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity .
We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries .
But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change .
In addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past .
to underscore the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sacrificed for , refusing to be cowed by setbacks and hardships .
These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high .
It is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world .
There is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive .
And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village .
On both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind .
Indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy .
As a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult .
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament .
Be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption .
We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage .
But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense .
I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole .
Over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance .
To these , I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman , a truly distinguished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old .
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ;and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns .
It is a matter of proud record that , for instance , female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ;
But I can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and I dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended .
These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation .
On this we still have some way to go .
I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society .
Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance .
our Paralympians continue to do us proud ;
This initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition .
and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water .
The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people .
and even more remarkable , about 500 000 jobs a year between 2004 and 2007 .
Within South Africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life .
The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ;
These and other programmes , including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February , form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future .
To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Professor Servaas van der Berg :
Among households that include children , the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically between 2002 and 2006 .
The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase ;
All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this .
We are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail .
Thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved .
Steadily but surely , our continent is progressing towards her renaissance , with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders agenda , asserting her hope and her resilience on the world stage .
It is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country .
It is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 .
Daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack .
That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa .
This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability .
Our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system .
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ;
In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country .
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ;
This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant , which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 .
And we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations !
I have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance I have come .
As such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries .
and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays .
We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-EU Summit later this year .
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ;Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ;
Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe .
All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 .
Now the work of reconstruction can start in earnest ;
We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them .
Rather , I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of visions .
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia , and countries in Asia , the Middle East , as well as Latin and North America .
Six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 .
We can do all this ;
We are of course Rugby World Champions ;
and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region .
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement .
Virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion ― from stadia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans ― confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament .
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections .
This is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines .
Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings .
As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action , we will pay particular attention to :
We can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis .
Of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined .
We still have a long way to go .
Mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running .
Firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century .
We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us .
Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner .
Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all .
This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality .
Yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country .
In the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership .
However , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable .
Within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern
Honourable Members ;
﻿Honourable Speaker; 
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; 
11 February 2010 
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; 
Dumelang, molweni, goeie naand, good evening, sanibonani nonke emakhaya! 
South African and foreign media; 
I stand before you this evening, 20 years since President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of prison. 
Chairperson of SALGA and all local government leadership; 
Former President FW de Klerk; 
Former political prisoners and veterans who are with us here witnessed that because they were part of that process. 
Our father, Former President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia; 
The release of Madiba was brought about by the resolute struggles of the South African people. 
Distinguished premiers and speakers of our provinces; 
Special international guests, especially the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Mr Jean Ping; 
Isithwalandwe President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela; 
Fellow South Africans, 
Honourable Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa and all esteemed members of the Judiciary; 
Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions; 
We have chosen this as the day to call this Joint Sitting of Parliament to deliver the State of the Nation Address, to celebrate a watershed moment that changed our country. 
Members of the diplomatic corps; 
Former deputy presidents; 
Deputy President of the Republic, Honourable Kgalema Motlanthe; 
Former political prisoners and veterans; 
Honorouble Speaker; 
Siyavuya ukuba nani ngobubusuku bubaluleke kangaka. 
Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders; 
We extend our gratitude to our friends and comrades in the international community, for fighting side by side with us to achieve freedom. 
On this special day, we must also acknowledge the contribution of those within the leadership of the National Party, who eventually realised that apartheid had no future. 
Honourable compatriots, 
We also remember and pay tribute to Mr Harry Schwarz, who sadly passed away last week. 
They played a significant role in the process leading to the release of Madiba. 
Allow me to mention the role played by former President PW Botha. 
He was, among other things, a member of the Rivonia defence team. 
We greet the leadership of the ruling party and Alliance partners, for whom this is an extra special occasion. 
We extend a special welcome to the Mandela family. 
Compatriots and friends, 
We are celebrating this day with former political prisoners who we have specially invited to join us. 
President Botha worked with the former Minister of Justice, Mr Kobie Coetzee, who was in turn assisted by Dr Neil Barnard and Mr Mike Louw. 
We welcome in particular those who have travelled from abroad to be here, Helene Pastoors, Michael Dingake from Botswana, Mr Andimba Toivo ya Toivo of Swapo in Namibia. 
responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable. 
You will off course recall that the masses of this country, in their different formations, 
We are pleased to be joined by members of the legal team in the Rivonia Treason trial – Lord Joel Joffe, who is now based in London and Judge Arthur Chaskalson. 
They became a symbol of the sacrifices of many who bore the brunt of apartheid. 
It was he who initiated the discussion about the possibility of the release of political prisoners. 
These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation. 
In this, President de Klerk demonstrated great courage and decisive leadership. 
His wisdom was also displayed in the Harare Declaration, which he wrote and championed. 
During the course of this year, we will mark the centenary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa, which was established in 1910. 
who also called for Madiba's release, as well as that of other political prisoners and the return of exiles. 
Honourable members, 
who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy. 
"I stand before you, not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people. 
On this great day, let me also acknowledge the role played by the late Ms Helen Suzman. 
President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a non-sexist, non-racial, democratic and prosperous South Africa. 
Honourable members, 
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, 
I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands." 
These moments in our history demonstrate our ability to come together, even under the most difficult of circumstances, and to put the country's interests first above all other interests. 
It was his outstanding leadership, foresight and clarity of vision that led the ANC to intensify the pursuit of a negotiated settlement. 
In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally. 
Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today. 
This created a unitary state. 
As we mark this centenary later in the year, we should reflect on how far we have travelled as a country. 
Significantly, the exclusion of black people from this Union was one of the chief reasons for the formation of the African National Congress in 1912. 
Deur saam te werk, kan ons meer bereik. 
As we celebrate Madiba's release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white. 
She was for a long time, a lone voice in Parliament, calling for change. 
We recall the words of Madiba on his release, when he said and I quote: 
It was this that laid the groundwork for the historic announcements by President FW de Klerk, 20 years ago. 
We also recognise the role of the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
We reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to the international community for its unwavering support to our struggle. 
We congratulate the overall winner, Charlotte Le Fleur of Worcester Secondary School, and all the participants for the hard work. 
Two hundred and sixty six children from all provinces participated in the pre-State of the Nation debate on the role of the youth in the fight against poverty. 
In February last year, government, business, labour and community representatives agreed on a package of measures to reduce the scale and impact of the crisis. 
Honourable members, 
We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country, workers and schoolchildren, can be part of the occasion. 
Many of those who lost their jobs were the breadwinners in poor families. 
Last year, we experienced our first recession in 17 years. 
We are meeting against the backdrop of a global economic crisis. 
Compatriots and friends, 
The crisis cost our economy about 900 000 jobs. 
We have put many of these measures in place. 
We have implemented decisive anti-recession spending by government, especially on infrastructure. 
in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life – the ideal of a democratic and free society, 
To ensure a safety cushion for the poor, we brought social grant increases forward, and extended the Child-Support Grant to children over 14 years of age. 
We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion. 
Unemployment rates for young people are substantially higher than the average. 
Government will therefore not withdraw its support measures. 
It is too soon, though, to be certain of the pace of recovery. 
Honourable members, 
Eskom will continue to build additional generation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power stations. 
Fellow South Africans, 
These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income, work experience and training opportunities. 
We have identified some areas of improvement, which we will effect going forward, including ensuring more labour-intensive projects. 
Our rural development programme will improve rural productivity, and the lives of people living in rural areas. 
To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy, to aid growth and development, we have established the 
Over the next three years, government will spend R846 billion on public infrastructure. 
The jobs are in areas like construction, home and community-based care, and environmental projects. 
In the next three years, an additional two million children from poor families and households, aged 15 to 18 years, 
A further expansion of public employment programmes is also underway. 
The most urgent focus of policy change must be interventions to create jobs for young people. 
Honourable members, 
The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by December 2009. 
We are grateful for the spirit of family, community and voluntary work that inspires many people to help those most affected by the crisis, through these difficult times. 
Our Industrial Policy Action Plan and our new focus on green jobs, will build stronger and more labour-absorbing industries. 
On transport, we will maintain and expand our road network. 
Economic indicators suggest that we are now turning the corner. 
Among other things, this will look at the participation of independent power producers, and protecting the poor from rising electricity prices. 
We will establish an independent system operator, separate from Eskom Holdings. 
The Industrial Development Corporation has put aside R6 billion to help companies in distress. 
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, chaired by the President. 
We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set. 
Proposals will be tabled to subsidise the cost of hiring younger workers, to encourage firms to take on inexperienced staff. 
Government introduced a “training lay-off scheme” to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retrenchment. 
Our long-term infrastructure programme will help us grow faster. 
Now is the time to lay the groundwork for stronger growth going forward, and for growth that gives rise to more jobs. 
We will ensure that our rail network is reliable, competitive and better integrated with our sea ports. 
Our education and skills programmes will increase our productivity and competitiveness. 
These efforts were enhanced by our Public Works Programme. 
Underpinning our strategy for economic recovery and growth, is our capital investment programme. 
Economic activity is rising in South Africa, and we expect growth going forward. 
We know that these and other measures cannot fully mitigate the effects of the recession. 
will benefit from the Child-Support Grant. 
The labour statistics released on Tuesday, show that the economy is now creating jobs rather than shedding them. 
To ensure reliable power supply, we have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Energy, to develop a 20-year integrated resource plan. 
home-based care, school maintenance and early childhood development initiatives. 
This year, 2010, shall be a year of action. 
We are building a performance-oriented state, by improving planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation. 
When this administration came into office last year, we undertook to work harder to build a strong developmental state. 
This includes local infrastructure and tertiary projects and literacy projects, 
We said it would be a state that responds to the needs and aspirations of the people, and which performs better and faster. 
Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency. 
The defining feature of this administration will be that it knows where people live, understands their needs and responds faster. 
We will expect the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this vision. 
We have directed the agency to work faster to establish its structures, throughout the country, so that it can assist us to mainstream youth development programmes within government. 
Government must work faster, harder and smarter. 
Honourable members, 
We are therefore making interventions to lower maternal mortality rates, to reduce new HIV infections and to effectively treat HIV and tuberculosis. 
Our education targets are simple but critical. 
reaffirming their commitment to the Quality Learning and Teaching Campaign from the beginning of 2010. 
We welcome last month's statement by the three teacher unions, NAPTOSA, SADTU and SAOU, 
We will assist teachers by providing detailed daily lesson plans. 
We will continue to improve our healthcare system. 
We will take further our work to reduce serious and violent crimes, and ensure that the justice system works efficiently. 
We will undertake a number of key activities towards the achievement of these outcomes. 
Unless we do this, we will not improve the quality of education. 
We must confront the fact that life expectancy at birth, has dropped from 60 years in 1994 to just below 50 years today. 
As you are aware, we are committed to five priorities: 
We are working hard to ensure that everyone in South Africa feels safe and is safe. 
The work of departments will be measured by outcomes, developed through our performance monitoring and evaluation system. 
From this year onwards, all grade 3, 6 and 9 
We must also increase the number of youth who enter learnerships in the private and public sectors. 
We need to invest in our youth to ensure a skilled and capable workforce to support growth and job creation. 
This will be recorded in an auditable written report. 
The ministers who are responsible for a particular outcome, will sign a detailed delivery agreement with the President. 
We have placed education and skills development at the centre of this government's policies. 
In addition, each of our 27 000 schools will be assessed by officials from the Department of Basic Education. 
education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, and fighting crime. 
We will also reduce infant mortality through the massive immunisation programme. 
Results will be sent to parents to track progress. 
We have partnered with the Development Bank of Southern Africa to improve the functionality of public hospitals and their district offices. 
This action will ensure that women, children and persons with disabilities can access developmental opportunities. 
We are working with higher education institutions to ensure that eligible students obtain financial assistance, through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. 
We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government. 
Another key outcome is to ensure a long and healthy life for all South Africans. 
We aim to increase the pass rate for these tests from the current average of between 35 and 40% to at least 60% by 2014. 
We will implement all the undertakings made on World AIDS Day relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures. 
We also need to integrate gender equity measures into the Government's Programme of Action. 
We will reinstate health programmes in schools. 
We are implementing plans to increase the number of policemen and women by 10% over the next three years. 
We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a public-private partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects. 
It will outline what is to be done, how, by whom, within what time period and using what measurements and resources. 
Fellow South Africans, 
Intensive work is underway to ensure that this work is on schedule. 
We urge parents to cooperate with us in making this a success. 
We have also set ambitious targets for skills development, to produce additional engineers and technicians, and to increase the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers. 
In addition, we will work to improve the effectiveness of local government, infrastructure development and human settlements. 
In our 2010 programme, we want to improve the ability of our children to read, write and count in the foundation years. 
Honourable members, 
To students, we will provide easy-to-use workbooks in all 11 languages. 
This includes building and upgrading hospitals and clinics, and further improving the working conditions of healthcare workers. 
We therefore plan to increase the training of 16-25 year olds in further education and training facilities. 
Honourable members, 
We will also continue preparations for the establishment of a national health insurance system. 
We aim to increase the number of matric students who are eligible for university admission to 175 000 a year by 2014. 
This will enable us to provide a second chance at education, for those who do not qualify for university. 
students will write literacy and numeracy tests that are independently moderated. 
We want learners and teachers to be in school, in class, on time, learning and teaching for seven hours a day. 
We have identified the fight against hijacking, business and house robberies, 
Tshebedisano mmoho etla lwantsha botloko-tsebe. 
A number of issues have already received attention. 
We reiterate that there are no grievances that can justify violence and the destruction of property. 
Let us participate in community safety forums. 
We are working to upgrade well-located informal settlements and provide proper service and land tenure to at least 500 000 households by 2014. 
This provided valuable insight into the challenges in local government. 
During this year of action, let us work together to make local government everybody's business. 
After the Balfour visit, we sent a nine-member ministerial team to visit the area to address the issues that had been raised by the community. 
Let us always be ready to provide the police with information about criminal activity. 
as well as contact crimes such as murder, rape and assault, as top priorities. 
We plan to set aside over 6 000 hectares of well-located public land for low-income and affordable housing. 
Compatriots and esteemed guests, 
This will ensure that local government has the correct management, administrative and technical skills. 
We held a meeting with mayors and municipal managers last year. 
We all have a role to play. 
Local government must work. 
We also visited various communities and municipalities, including Balfour in Mpumalanga and Thembisa in Gauteng. 
In December 2009, Cabinet approved a turnaround strategy for local government. 
Let us stop buying stolen goods. 
I have directed the ministers to attend to the outstanding matters. 
Municipalities must improve the provision of housing, water, sanitation, electricity, waste management and roads. 
We have directed law-enforcement agencies to take a tougher stance on lawlessness in Balfour and other areas. 
Sathi kufanele babe nezindawo zezemidlalo kanye nezindawo zokuthenga ezinkulukazi eziphucuzekile njengasemadolobheni. 
We will intensify efforts to promote the interests of South Africa globally. 
Honourable members, 
We are implementing similar programmes in seven sites across the country, benefiting 21 wards. 
Together with Brazil, India and China, and joined by the United States, which represented the developed world, we made a significant contribution to the accord adopted 
Yet, we still lose a lot of water through leaking pipes and inadequate infrastructure. 
We will work to increase broadband speed and ensure a high standard of Internet service, in line with international norms. 
We will support efforts to speed up the political and economic integration of the SADC region, and promote intra-regional trade and investment. 
South Africa continues to play a leading role in continental efforts to strengthen the African Union and its organs, and to work for unity. 
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson of the NCOP, 
We will focus energy on revitalising the New Partnership for Africa's Development, as a strategy for economic development on the continent. 
We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incentivise the private banking and housing sector, to develop new products to meet this housing demand. 
Access to health and education facilities has improved. 
This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are well protected, and are continually enhanced. 
Honourable members, 
at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December last year. 
As part of our efforts to encourage greater economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost to communicate. 
Although it does not go as far as required, it is an important step forward as it commits all countries to respond to climate change. 
Ngonyaka odlule sathi, abantu basemakhaya nabo banelungelo lokuba nogesi, amanzi, izindlu zangasese ezigijima amanzi nemigwaqo. 
We will be putting in place measures to reduce our water loss by half by 2014. 
We want 60% of households in these sites to meet their food requirements from own production by 2014. 
A key new initiative will be to accommodate people whose salaries are too high to get government subsidies, 
The South African public can look forward to an even further reduction of broadband, cellphone, landline and public phone rates. 
We also need to better integrate land reform and agricultural support programmes. 
Kancane kancane kuze kulunge, phela bakwethu, kuthiwa nempandla iqala ngenhlonhlo. 
As South Africa, we have voluntarily committed ourselves to specific emission-reduction targets, and will continue working on our long-term climate change mitigation strategy. 
We are not a water-rich country. 
By 2014, we aim to have sites in 160 wards. 
In this regard, we launched the first pilot site of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme in Giyani, Limpopo, in August last year. 
Fellow South Africans, 
but who earn too little to qualify for a normal bank mortgage. 
We will work harder with our international counterparts towards a legally binding treaty. 
Our success in this area will be measured by the increase in the number of small-scale farmers that become economically viable. 
Since then, 231 houses have been built. 
Bakwethu, 
Progress has also been made in providing infrastructure to support agricultural development, and training for community members. 
Fellow South Africans, 
Compatriots, 
This week, we terminated 32 687 fraudulent social grants payments, valued at R180 million. 
Our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Corruption is looking at ways to decisively defeat corruption. 
Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme, which will set the norms and standards for public servants in all spheres. 
We require excellence and hard work. 
As you are aware, we introduced the Presidential Hotline to make government and The Presidency more accessible to the public, and to help unblock service-delivery blockages. 
The hotline represents our determination to do things differently in government. 
It has made a difference in the lives of many South Africans. 
and in applications for drivers’ licences, social grants and identity documents, among others. 
We are pleased with the progress government is making in some areas. 
Nga u shumisana rothe ringa bveledza zwinzhi. 
Honourable Members, 
The Public Service has to respond to the call to make this term one of faster action and improved state performance. 
We need public servants who are dedicated, capable and who care for the needs of citizens. 
We continue our efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, 
whose call about her late husband's pension was the first we took on the first day of the service. 
Through the Speaker, we have invited a multiparty delegation from Parliament to visit the call centre, 
It provides an opportunity to recognise the important contribution of the Indian community in the fields of labour, business, science, sport, religion, arts, culture and the achievement and consolidation of our democracy. 
I thank you. 
so that MPs can get a first-hand account of the work done. 
We can mention Mrs Buziwe Ngaleka of Mount Frere, 
Compatriots, let us also stand behind the national team Bafana Bafana. 
We welcome Dr Imtiaz Sooliman of the Gift of the Givers in this house today. 
produce surprises. 
As we celebrate Madiba's release today, we recommit ourselves to reconciliation, national unity, non-racialism and building a better future together as South Africans, 
I would like to especially recognise one South African who never fails to assist in times of disasters, and helps us to promote the vision of a caring society. 
I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
We therefore have to make the World Cup a huge success in his honour. 
I have outlined the main elements of our plans for 2010, our collective commitment as government to the people of South Africa. 
Fellow South Africans, 
These are just two among many success stories. 
The State of the Nation Address provides a broad overview of our action plan. 
We only have three months to go. 
Most importantly, ithikithi esandleni bakwethu! 
Let me take this opportunity to once again extend our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Haiti on the monumental tragedy that has befallen them. 
We have spent many years planning for this World Cup. 
Compatriots and friends, 
And we are determined to make a success of it. 
Compatriots and friends, 
Inspired by our icon Madiba, it is my honour to dedicate this 
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." 
Ministers will provide the detail in their respective Budget Vote speeches. 
President Mandela was central in assisting the country to win the rights to host this great event. 
Honourable members, fellow South Africans, 
She is with us here tonight. 
As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to the 2010 Local Organising Committee for their sterling effort.

I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony, and with equal opportunities. 
We are pleased that our rescue teams were able to go and assist. 
"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. 
We wish the LOC Chairperson, Irvin Khoza, CEO Danny Jordaan and Bafana Bafana coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, all the best for the months ahead. 
In November this year, we will mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Indians in South Africa. 
2010 State of the Nation Address to all our heroes and heroines, sung and unsung, known and unknown. 
The hosting of the FIFA World Cup makes 2010 truly a year of action. 
The infrastructure, security and logistics arrangements are in place to ensure a successful tournament. 
Let us work together to make this year of action a successful one for our country. 
From these and other examples, we identify weaknesses that should be rectified by various spheres of government. 
Fellow South Africans, 
We also have among us Mr Nkululeko Cele, who was helped to obtain identity documents, which allowed him to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology. 
Let us all buy tickets timeously to be able to attend the games. 
We are guided by what Madiba said in the dock, that and I quote: 
It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to achieve.

State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2007 
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; 
Mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
President F.W . 
de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk ; 
Heads of our Security Services ; 
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service ; 
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; 
Our honoured traditional leaders ; 
Governor of the Reserve Bank ; 
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ; 
Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; 
President Nelson Mandela and Madame Graca Machel ; 
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners ; 
When she died , we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital . 
People of South Africa : 
the father of her children , her companion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , Oliver Reginald Tambo . 
as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today . 
But that was not to be . 
His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today . 
I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge 
Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains . 
However , I am indeed very pleased to acknowledge in our midst this morning the Hon Albertina Luthuli , daughter of our first Nobel Peace Laureate , 
Once more , we convey our condolences to the Tambo family . 
I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Orders . 
I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Womens March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the Presidents box , 
what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli , and the Order of the Companions of O.R . 
Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year , we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband , 
we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion . 
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , 
Inkosi Albert Luthuli , whose tragic death 40 years ago we commemorate this year , remembering the tragic day when it was reported that he had been crushed by a speeding train in the cane-fields of KwaDukuza . 
On that occasion we said in part : 
It was a place in which squalor , the stench of poverty , the open sewers , the decaying rot , the milling crowds of wretchedness , the unending images of a landscape 
At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month , the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , 
nonsexist and prosperous country , committed to the noble vision of human solidarity . 
, the 10th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic , 
what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives 
We pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sacrificed for our freedom , as well as to you , our friends from the rest of the world 
, that we will never betray the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform South Africa 
raising the levels of literacy and numeracy , and opening the doors of learning and culture to all 
regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream 
, as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , 
into a democratic , peaceful , nonracial , 
to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action ― 
with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters 
enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society ! 
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream , 
strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse , assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets , 
our government committed itself , working with all South Africans , to implement detailed programmes intended : 
The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today 
and birds and houses fit for kings and queens , and lyrical music , and love . 
It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse . 
guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living , 
It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others , 
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy ; 
to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 ! 
It was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods 
It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage 
We must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , 
We have gathered here today , on Freedom Day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , 
For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society 
Fifty years before , as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People , which adopted the Freedom Charter , 
convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day 
African and European , Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom . 
who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause . 
The work to create that South Africa has begun . 
whom our Parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections . 
We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , 
was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls , 
We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people , 
reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections . 
who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say ― an end to all that ! 
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector ; 
the patriots of the day had said , Let us speak together , all of us together ― 
None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty . 
With your indulgence , I would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 
and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa . 
and wooded lanes , and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass , 
electrified fences , guard dogs , police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters , 
This relates to everything , from the improvement of the health of our people , to reducing the levels of crime , 
And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom . 
fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs 
Having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves ― 
, as I have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the General Elections of that year . 
to increase spending on scientific research and development ; 
At an average of over 4,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 . 
I am happy to report that with regard to each of these commitments , government remains hard at work to ensure that the nations objectives are met . 
Investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 
Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low . 
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation ; 
The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ; 
Today , fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product ― at about 18,4 ― is at its highest since 1991 . 
increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world . 
to improve our export performance , focussing on services and manufactured goods ; 
and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . 
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole ; 
From owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; 
to intensify the housing programme ; 
The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us . 
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent ; 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ; 
, with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8 . 
But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs . 
We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy . 
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ; 
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture ; 
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth , reconstruction and development of our country ; 
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment ; 
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy ; 
The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years . 
and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery . 
to expand access to such services as water , electricity and sanitation ; 
to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities . 
around which feasibility work has started , the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system . 
The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years . 
It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity . 
as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs . 
in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 . 
These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , combining both road and rail . 
It is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 
This will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources 
While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004 , 
According to the United Nations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation . 
Over the past three years , the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs . 
While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , 
It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone , 
The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries . 
We must act to change this situation . 
And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions 
These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga 
Access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved . 
We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 . 
But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly . 
by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected . 
As Honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport . 
the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations . 
However , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed 
improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage . 
today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants . 
By 2005 , South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal 
In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006 : 
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme . 
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises . 
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty ; 
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments , 
We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme . 
including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , 
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things : 
The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done 
Many more are without electricity and sanitation . 
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty ; 
We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country 
We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year . 
At the same time , the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 . 
A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion . 
We should indeed celebrate this great achievement . 
While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , 
In the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage . 
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country ; 
An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace . 
This applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates . 
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people . 
On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution . 
Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored . 
that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities 
does point to some defects in our systems in this regard . 
Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication ; 
In this context , address all indigence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . 
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ; 
we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex . 
to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement . 
We are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half . 
, continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market . 
We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up . 
Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ; 
Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent . 
We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs . 
and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security . 
While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , 
and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society , in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation . 
And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure , 
and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants . 
Obviously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime . 
with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected 
in the Northwest Province , the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50 ; 
In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities , the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko 
closeted behind walls and barbed wire , ever anxious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces . 
improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented . 
Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new . 
Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level . 
Further , on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers , we are duty-bound to ask the question - 
and work to attain the happiness that comes with it . 
This applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel vetting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles , and so on . 
have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , 
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial . 
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace . 
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions . 
In other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . 
and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of identities 
While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , 
Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us   the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector . 
In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said : 
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , 
What has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions 
we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met . 
and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements . 
For instance , in September last year , 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers ; 
Peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment 
Certainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , 
reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together ! 
the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted . 
It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities 
We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay , 
Promoting peace and security will involve all people . 
I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime . 
As such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda . 
Compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed . 
These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , 
informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Agenda , which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , 
I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka 
We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole . 
working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team , 
This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative , 
We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks , 
with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros . 
Honourable Members ; 
concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , 
and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February . 
This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development . 
the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public , and strengthening the Ward Committees ― 80 of which have been established across the country . 
It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits , 
as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system . 
Starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions . 
which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , 
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed , we will : 
nuclear power generation , natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy . 
and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings ; 
start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers . 
As the Honourable Members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools . 
Honourable Members ; 
In addition , Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres 
With regard to communications , I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies 
At the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system . 
as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector . 
including capital goods in ICT 
which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , 
agriculture and agro-processing , the white goods sector , creative industries , community and social services and pharmaceuticals . 
and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates 
including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ; 
take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance 
each employing 1000 persons , 
intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work , including a youth cooperatives programme , 
Quite clearly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , 
having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments 
process the Companies Bill , adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday , 
The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans . 
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification . 
The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries . 
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing , 
as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ; 
these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy . 
These centres will be established in areas identified by government . 
inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries 
and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers . 
tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry 
In this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training institutes and others . 
with employment opportunities ― and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , big and small , which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative ; 
and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ; 
In this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year : 
complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate , 
After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . 
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
Because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things : 
that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers . 
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society . 
developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities . 
In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever . 
With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a State Diamond Trader 
We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing . 
develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation , 
We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ; 
ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency , SEDA ; 
develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes , 
, transport and energy : with regard to energy , we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on 
and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ; 
and integrated anti-poverty strategy we have mentioned , as well as address issues pertaining to national unity , value systems and identity . 
speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project , implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the 
This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 . 
Rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system . 
speeding up of the construction of low-cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to handle finances , 
This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people . 
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented . 
A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa . 
expanding access to Early Childhood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme ; 
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , 
We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion , including the comprehensive 
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
piloting of the Land Use Management Bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the much-delayed agreement with the private sector on low-cost housing are finalised ; 
will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project , 
continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of TB , road accidents and violent crime . 
continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system ; 
we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity . 
The principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , 
expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries , increasing the number of training institutions , improving the quality of training , and instituting a bursary system ; 
continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals , and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers ; 
In addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years . 
and in this regard , let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SANTACO 
For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should 
ensuring the implementation , without further delay , of measures to reduce the cost of medicines ; 
In this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment . 
The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech . 
Bus Rapid Transit System in the Metros and recapitalisation of Metrorail : 
What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , 
government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC . 
The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies . 
This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , 
We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible . 
we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible . 
All these efforts , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security . 
and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly ; 
while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes . 
In the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include : 
and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society . 
a wage subsidy for low-wage employees , possibly directed at first entrants into the job market , especially young people ; 
improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating . 
But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , 
We hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , 
In this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 . 
chosen to participate in a Community Survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . 
complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government ; 
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson : 
Just over a month ago , South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . 
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service , in order massively to reduce case backlogs ; 
bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology , and ensure the optimum utilisation of the fingerprint database 
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : 
and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ; 
we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , Côte dIvoire and Somalia . 
However , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , 
conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings . 
continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police , and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service 
We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Comoros and Sudan in particular 
implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections ; 
and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution ; 
actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals . 
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process . 
We should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom . 
further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership . 
These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such 
against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention . 
Further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency . 
We should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
especially in respect of border control , and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard ; 
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres ; 
to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development . 
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ; 
― indeed , many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems ; 
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - 
Thank you . 
to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society . 
Similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes . 
As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households 
We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront . 
Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation . 
Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational ; 
start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services , 
as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution . 
As we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in 
in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security . 
We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition . 
intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime , building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cash-in-transit heists , drug trafficking and poaching of game and abalone ; 
our partners in India , Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as Japan , Europe and North America . 
while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign , 
to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years , and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced ; 
This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country . 
Critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2007 
In this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground   , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . 
do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . 
Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia . 
One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations . 
I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums . 
finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning , in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy ; 
We are not there yet . 
Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region .

The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again 
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems 
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations 
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards , remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions ; 
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres , including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system ; 
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ; 
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose 
interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation . 
In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : 
implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations ; 
Since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better . 
In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf . 
a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings , death , disability and unemployment benefits . 
In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study , the National Income Dynamics Study . 
And so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share . 
We are proud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our 
But no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . 
﻿It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , 
Of course , I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players 
and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of Business Unusual , 
Chairperson of SALGA , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
Accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco . 
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ; 
We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner , the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago . 
we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way - 
The details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the Power Conservation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published . 
I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year . 
Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting , solar water heating and geyser load management in households , including housing standards for all new houses and developments . 
and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition will be intensified . 
In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 92 years old . 
This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 
I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January . 
Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament 
I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 . 
Working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , 
I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties . 
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises . 
As we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― Business Unusual ! 
who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges . 
I will convene a meeting of the Joint Presidential Working Groups to coordinate our overall actions . 
Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; 
, to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands ! 
All these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin . 
Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned . 
Indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people . 
You will ask whether I agree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion 
it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , 
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; 
And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil . 
The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa 
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can .   In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric during the course of last week , GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf . 
As I was preparing this Address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds 
They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity . 
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; 
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament ; 
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals 
I speak here today in the presence of my mother , Epainette Mbeki , MaMofokeng , 
An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not . 
However , like all the Honourable Members , 
They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month . 
And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today . 
I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow . 
Happily , this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which 
Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual ! 
These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another . 
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy , and poverty eradication 
In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol , Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy 
This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges . 
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development 
They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices .

All these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race 
Governor of the Reserve Bank ; 
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime 
Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables . 
As the Honourable Members know , she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . 
We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period . 
Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom . 
to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . 
that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow . 
I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully . 
The sense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress 
it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , 
What she expects as her birthday present is the truth . 
Already , money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation .

State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008 
and where possible , some projects will be accelerated . 
We must ensure that we sustain this approach . 
We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud . 
Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year . 
of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans . 
Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place . 
My answer to this question is a definite No ! 
At the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . 
We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman , representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include Nelson Mandela . 
The main categories of these priorities are : 
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections . 
The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity 
Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation . 
People of South Africa : 
We acknowledge , both among the Honourable Members and our guests , the many founders of the United Democratic Front , 25 years ago . 
Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure 
and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest , that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people ,   but also to many others outside our borders . 
The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 . 
I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her . 
Task teams are currently working in many areas . 
I say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream . 
This must inspire Bafana Bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year . 
work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes . 
Sure , the problems here are serious ;   overcoming them will require ingenuity , especially in energy efficiency and energy saving , as well as the development of alternative power supplies . 
I will also shortly announce a team of Energy Champions consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans 
Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan . 
I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all . 
on which it must focus in a special way , using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue . 
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners ; 
However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient . 
Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body 
This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the 
, in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future ! 
and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament . 
Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained . 
On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency . 
More than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , 
They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings , Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency . 
In this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin . 
Among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient . 
and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , 
Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country . 
We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry . 
At the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability . 
, including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location . 
whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today . 
Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation . 
at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us 
I hope relatively unscathed This is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions . 
The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination . 
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid . 
The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― Business Unusual ! 
An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development . 
The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy . 
However , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . 
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary ; 
Cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right . 
Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year . 
While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned 
We are a minerals resource economy .   We must therefore continue to support the mining industry .

I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel , A Tale of Two Cities .

key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables ,   retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing . 
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation . 
We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects . 
I am certain that the South African Football Association , our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira , 
Indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity . 
Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States . 
, the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week . 
This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police , the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions , 
And so I quote these words : 
But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― 
This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end . 
As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge . 
In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream . 
we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 ! 
There are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take . 
They are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor . 
and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today . 
To make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance 
We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-saving measures . 
Heads of our Security Services ; 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ; 
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations . 
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training 
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people . 
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all 
to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution . 
She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , 
Chief Executive of Anglo American , Cynthia Carroll , when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week , on Tuesday , February 5 . 
It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . 
and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one 
We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , Robert Sobukwe , 
and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint . 
efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later . 
in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities   insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . 
This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans 
that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous South Africa . 
We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , 
Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters . 
In this regard , I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the 
The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , 
and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud . 
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme . 
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ; 
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency . 
Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding . 
Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency . 
In this regard , R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy . 
Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term , the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities 
We are taking steps to enhance Eskoms maintenance capacity . 
Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year , 
However , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity . 
And precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity ! 
﻿This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure . 
I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land 
Honourable Members ; 
thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . 
reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa . 
Naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers . 
more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , 
Mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate 
and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner . 
On both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind . 
we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward . 
on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August , 1989 ― commonly known as the Harare Declaration . 
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament , Traditional leaders ; 
Of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy . 
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ; 
but from the point of view of government systems , we can draw solace from the fact that over 70 of cases of corruption reported in the media 
In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale , the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students , and his peers . 
Onkgopotse Tiro , Harry Nengwekhulu , Themba Sono , Mapetla Mohapi , Mosioua Lekota , Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi . 
As we look back over the past fifteen years , I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki 
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 
Above all , I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today ― 
and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services 
In this regard , we should salute the late President of the African National Congress , Oliver Reginald Tambo , for initiating 
Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance . 
It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee 
and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the 2004 democratic mandate ! 
Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , 
especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact . 
Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament 
Our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system . 
They include Brian Bunting , Billy Nair , Ncumisa Kondlo , John Gomomo , Joe Nhlanhla , Cas Saloojee , John Schippers and Jan van Eck . 
It is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world . 
Indeed , it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003 , the economy created about one-and-half million net new jobs ; 
to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell . 
A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago . 
It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth . 
Though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves . 
In this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , 
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress ; 
on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole . 
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections . 
These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation . 
It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , 
and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : 
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ; 
And so , 15 years into our democracy , we can assert that the fear , the insecurity and the loathing that 100 years ago 
That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , 
and even more remarkable , about 500 000 jobs a year between 2004 and 2007 . 
become public because government has detected the wrongdoing and is in fact acting against it . 
This is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , 
This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda . 
It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― 
In the First Decade of Freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 . 
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ; 
Thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations . 
that we should indeed , in the words of the Freedom Charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture ! 
We may even say that , in a strange quirk of fate , many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past ; 
All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 . 
Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment . 
In the end , the challenge is as much about regulation ; 
While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion . 
Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures ; 
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; 
That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , 
Wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life . 
integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks 
Our democracy is healthy . 
It is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , 
In this regard , we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiros cousin , Pat Tlhagwana . 
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ; 
In this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product . 
However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public . 
The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people . 
Indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― 
with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom . 
whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― 
And because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes . 
For inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them . 
Honourable Members ; 
I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , 
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town February 2009 
As such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries . 
and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come . 
as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President . 
As Honourable Members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus . 
Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms . 
Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , 
Comrades and friends ; 
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament ; 
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ; 
The same challenges confront the private sector . 
accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running . 
But ours is a journey of hope and resilience . 
and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country . 
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ; 
Except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing . 
Madam Deputy President ; 
South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 . 
Within South Africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life . 
A hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts . 
We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands . 
we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all . 
The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , 
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; 
As a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult . 
reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers . 
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans . 
worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― 
to underscore the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sacrificed for , refusing to be cowed by setbacks and hardships . 
and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient . 
And so , Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson , we should ask ourselves : how have our actions defined 
who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands . 
We do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation 
as it is about consistent enforcement . 
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed . 
Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm leadership . 
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ; 
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament . 
But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday , the 7th and 8th of February respectively . 
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society ; 
In this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago 
Chief Justice Langa ; 
partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines . 
These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward . 
That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the United Nations , on the approach to negotiations in South Africa . 
but truly misplaced . 
and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy . 
Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 . 
in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary ; 
These include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors . 
32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections . 
the path of South African societys evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy ; 
In the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership . 
To these , I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman , a truly distinguished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old . 
Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ? 
our nation is in a good state . 
Importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work . 
which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy . 
We hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour ! 
We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them . 
Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu , brother of Kalushi , representing the Mahlangu family . 
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo 
to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves . 
It may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate ; 
and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability . 
Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO , which included : Strini Moodley , Professor Barney Pityana , Steve Biko , 
Over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance . 
Yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations . 
is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life . 
Indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society . 
Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports . 
In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth . 
However , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves . 
However , we should not underestimate the challenges we face . 
While the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , 
Allow me , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible South Africans 
On a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe : 
I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society . 
should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society . 
almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level ; 
and we will be perfectly justified . 
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now . 
Six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake 
Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ; 
Our democracy is healthy . 
Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , 
that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA ; 
to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion . 
confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament . 
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security ; 
Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate . 
We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage . 
implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country ; 
strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability ; 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2009 
to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world . 
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement . 
to provide efficient , decent and equitable health care ; 
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation . 
In our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path . 
And we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations ! 
and the United States of America for elections the symbolism of which transcends the narrow boundaries of their nation-states . 
In addition , we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant 
in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy , 
We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership ; 
This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant , 
but beyond this , that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary . 
Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state 
This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime . 
Of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , 
But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change . 
Steadily but surely , our continent is progressing towards her renaissance , with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders agenda , 
It points to systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice system , from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders . 
while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources ― 
What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies 
and the level of inequality is too high . 
and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns . 
Secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes . 
To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Professor Servaas van der Berg : 
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia , and countries in Asia , the Middle East , as well as Latin and North America . 
This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports . 
But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later . 
and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail 
But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . 
continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health Insurance ; 
This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better . 
Alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing . 
We can do all this ; 
and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society . 
In this regard , we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book . 
Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities . 
We are of course Rugby World Champions ; 
and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly . 
Be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services ! 
the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world . 
and South Africa stands ready to assist wherever we can . 
Indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate . 
with severe consequences for actual production and trade . 
It is steadily growing stronger . 
and further afield to better the human condition . 
and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion : 
On the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme . 
We are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
our Paralympians continue to do us proud ; 
Within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern 
The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years . 
There is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive . 
It is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country . 
The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ; 
It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former President Nelson Mandela , in his biography , Long Walk to Freedom : 
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the 
so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories . 
on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable . 
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ; 
and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the electorate . 
and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays . 
And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , 
and Coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants . 
Now the work of reconstruction can start in earnest ; 
This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality . 
and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development . 
We believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system ; 
The abiding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic 
In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate . 
We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular . 
Violence against women and children is much too high . 
and sanitation . 
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Childrens Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60 . 
, female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ; 
we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis . 
Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage . 
but also to put in place measures that would obviate a recurrence . 
to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 . 
as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds . 
they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy . 
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended . 
In addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past . 
We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , 
and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity . 
Firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years . 
and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia and elsewhere . 
There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery . 
and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water . 
We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population . 
and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men . 
preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency ; 
This improvement is mirrored in access to basic services ― a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in money-metric poverty . 
But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense . 
Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate 
Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability . 
and global scale , not only to stem the impact of the crisis ; 
What , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , 
I have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance I have come . 
and to that we can attach no price ! 
Secondly , although the reductions in poverty have been substantial , aggregate inequality increased during the 1990s . 
The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards . 
intensifying the campaign to save energy , so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour , 
and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe . 
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ;

While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million . 
We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity . 
We are truly heartened that , yesterday , the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government . 
These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high . 
and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis . 
It is a matter of proud record that , for instance 
But I can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and I dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended . 
In this regard , Honourable Members , I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners , 
In this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations 
Further , our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world ; 
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ; 
Thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants . 
Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund 
and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment . 
Over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership . 
public works programmes , sector partnerships and strategies , local procurement , small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives ; 
This , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state . 
These and other programmes , including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February , 
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ; 
and crimes against women and children have not abated in any significant measure , is a matter of great concern . 
Governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided . 
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production ; 
On the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue . 
These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy . 
Ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive . 
The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans . 
HIV impacts most severely on young women . 
We can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis . 
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ; 
creating more jobs , better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment , 
We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including 
For instance , access to potable water has improved from 62 in 1996 to 88 in 2008 ; 
In this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance . 
recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change , resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing ; 
to create a united , nonracial , nonsexist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world . 
Firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century . 
We still have a long way to go . 
As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action , we will pay particular attention to : 
In this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds . 
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings , appropriately deploying resources from pension 
I have walked that long road to freedom . 
Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , 
Yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country . 
It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 . 
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations . 
and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption . 
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation 
This suggests that the poverty situation has improved remarkably , particularly among people experiencing the greatest degree of welfare deprivation . 
This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , 
These initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weaken the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the Southern African Customs Union . 
Daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack . 
As such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation . 
form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future . 
but inequality has not improved . 
However , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable . 
Among households that include children , the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically between 2002 and 2006 . 
The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase ; 
We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries . 
Thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , 
intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system , including better forensic capacity , 
Critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down . 
and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits . 
But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime . 
and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion . 
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services . 
In the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries 
the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality . 
rapid increase in the number of detectives , optimal utilisation of information and communications technology , and better management of the courts ; 
We wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of Zambia , Ghana 
In education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ; 
All these are assignments for the coming period . 
On its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , 
At the same time we will improve SADCs interaction with the Common Market of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community . 
and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society . 
in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods . 
The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat . 
Indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa

Indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African

We are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail . 
continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way ; 
as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region . 
We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China . 
Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals . 
in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes . 
delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : 
is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential . 
I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation 
asserting her hope and her resilience on the world stage . 
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ; 
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition . 
95 of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility ; 
and malaria cases have massively declined . 
Fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age 
All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this . 
Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator , former President Thabo Mbeki 
I have made missteps along the way . 
I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . 
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ; 
The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description . 
and provident funds , housing , financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment ; 
On this we still have some way to go . 
That depends on all of us ; 
Honourable Members ; 
Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings . 
But beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity ― 
access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse ; 
and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner . 
In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country . 
Of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined . 
We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems . 
submitting the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development to Parliament ; 
Combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects . 
Just two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu . 
The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , 
This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africas wealth . 
experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century . 
But we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ;
