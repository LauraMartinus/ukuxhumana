cooperatives are registered in the KZN database, 
Stimulating economic growth through coordinated infrastructure investment and strategic programmes 
A Request for Qualification was issued last week to the Market for a Design, Construct, Fixed Price Turnkey contract. The purpose of this procurement is to enable the DTP 
In respect of SMME support, during the trade mission to India in December 2005 led by the Premier, contact was established with the National Small Industries Corporation Ltd in India, 
The improvement in employment figures over the last year, moreover, is certainly partially attributable to the cooperatives initiative, which is already estimated to have attracted close to 35 000 individuals, 
The overwhelming success in the promotion of cooperatives and SMMEs means that our resources must be directed to support both cooperatives and SMMEs at district level. 
inter alia, a coordinated and efficiently implemented infrastructural investment programme, in which both government and the private sector will have major roles to play. 
In this regard I am also pleased to report very satisfactory progress over the last year: 
In the forthcoming MTEF, ring-fenced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job creation, poverty relief and black economic empowerment. These programmes are the following: 
 this strategy in turn is aligned to the national Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative. The rationale behind this approach is simple: 
Empowerment initiatives 
A further 5 high profile cases of fraud and corruption involving syndicates are under investigation, and we have joined forces with the Directorate of Special Operations and Asset Forfeiture Unit in order to secure successful prosecutions. 
Mr Speaker, in last years address I alluded to the fact that we will not attain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty alleviation programmes 
 the Office of the Premier will be responsible for coordinating the soccer development programme across the departments involved. 
into the second phase of development by establishing secondary and tertiary cooperatives. Eleven secondary coops will be setup in each of the district municipalities and metro, 
pre-qualified bidders that are technically, financially and legally qualified and meet the empowerment criteria, 
Such practices have to become far more efficient, ensuring that administrative delays do not place unbearable cashflow burden on the SMMEs. 
In terms of employment, according to the Stats SA Labour Force Survey, in 2004 993,000 people in the province were unemployed - this declined to 987,000 in 2005, 
The reforms in our asset and supply chain management systems and policies are proceeding on track and are set to greatly improve efficiencies in the way we procure and account for goods and services and physical assets. 
The land at La Mercy to be sold to the province. 
World Cup stadium development 
The intention is to provide a bridging programme, a one year certificate, a two year diploma and a three year degree in cooperatives and business management practice. 
Some of the cases are before the courts of law and misconduct enquiries are also being handled by respective departments. 
Both Ithala and the Provincial Government concede that this demand for finance cannot be met by Ithala alone. 
for emerging contractors aimed at promoting and supporting affirmable business and equity in the civil and building contractor sector. It comprises a six-staged advancement programme with contract value limits determined by experience, training and capacity. 
Given the huge deal flow which the initial SMME fund managed by Ithala has already generated, the Head of Treasury was tasked to develop a scheme 
which will then enter into contractual agreements with ACSA to manage and operate the airport and with the selected bidder from the private sector to design and construct the facility. 
amounting to approximately R6bn in 2005/06, to stimulate growth in the SMME sector and to advance black economic empowerment generally. 
POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE 2006/07 MTEF 
The focus will be on dissemination of information and giving guidance to women, youth and the disabled. 
The relocation of Durban International Airport when King Shaka International is operational in 2009; and 
Draft legislation establishing the DTP has been prepared and will be submitted to this Legislature in March. I appeal to Honourable Members to ensure that this Bill is dealt with within the strict timeframes we have set ourselves. 
As I mentioned, this year we will also be instituting a new co-financing model to support the growth of the small business sector in the province. 
An important part of governments infrastructure-related strategic investment programme for the medium term is the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone. 
if economic growth can be stepped up to average 4,5 over the next five years, and 6 from 2009 to 2014, then: 
to empower them so as to be capable of running viable commercial enterprises. This means that secondary coops will need to possess skills in financial management, 
We are proposing to allocate R31m, R89m and R139,5m over the MTEF period as a contribution to the building of soccer stadium infrastructure in the province. 
A special training unit has been created in collaboration with the University of Zululand to train managers and members of coops and to develop careers in the field. 
with the main functions of providing support to primary cooperatives, which are by design production units. The intention is to ensure that primary cooperatives get support from secondary and tertiary cooperatives, 
This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs, 
which will together with the Department of Sport and Recreation play a coordinating role in assisting the District Municipalities of Amajuba, Ugu, uMgungundlovu and uThungulu 
In the area of governance and risk management, quarterly summary reports on the risk profile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet. 
A contract is being concluded with the NSIC team of consultants, who will be based in the province for 10 weeks, and who will work with a team from Treasury and Economic Development. 
marketing and general business management. For technical skills secondary coops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required expertise and for private sector wishing to do business with this sector. 
The Dube TradePort Section 21 Company will have to be converted into a statutory public entity under the PFMA that is empowered to establish King Shaka International Airport Special Purpose Vehicle, 
Against this background, what are the governments expenditure priorities for the new MTEF budget cycle commencing in six weeks? 
including the provision and loan of capital equipment, on a day to day basis and are not dependant on government support permanently. Support will be given to secondary coops 
ECONOMIC SNAPSHOT 
inter alia through the bargaining muscle it will acquire over the control of resources and markets through the sheer scale of its operations, with benefits flowing to members of the cooperatives. 
The flagship Dube TradePort project incorporating a state of the art Airport in King Shaka International has made solid progress and we are on track to achieve our deadline for the project to be operational by 2009. 
Our quest to narrow the gap between the first and second economies will continue to be a central feature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as barbed wire, ceramic tiles, agri-food products, building materials, paper products etc; 
will deal with each of these three policy priority areas in turn. 
allowing time in the first year of the MTEF for the stakeholders to finalise the business case, funding model and ownership arrangements. 
I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term consistency in the budget policy framework and direction to achieve maximum impact over time. 
The equipment and professional expertise provided by the NSIC will be used to support the growth and development of small medium and micro enterprises in the province, including cooperatives at both the primary and secondary level. 
Co-financing strategy 
The intention 
and an electronic system to perform the acquisition stage of SCM, namely the sourcing of Quotations and Tenders  this project will both improve efficiencies and turnaround times as well as help to eliminate fraud and corruption. 
Our proposal is to set aside R20 million, R200 million and R1,5 billion over the 2006/07 MTEF years for this project  this is over and above the R100m already in this years budget for the Trade Port. 
I have alluded to the successes already attained in establishing primary cooperatives around the province in the last year. This year we intend to move the cooperatives programme 
But hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come  Whispering it will be happier; 
for financing business applications from primary cooperatives will be augmented by allocations of R100m, R187m and R217m over the 2006/07 MTEF  these funds will be managed by the Department of Economic Development. 
In reviewing its policy priorities for the new MTEF period, the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the goal of placing the province on a sustainably higher growth path a central part of its economic development strategy 
In the March budget address a year ago it was emphasized that government intended to use its procurement spend on goods and services, 
As the DTP will no longer be established as a PPP, the R100m allocated to the project in this years budget will be routed via Ithala to facilitate site preparation work  including site acquisition, perimeter fencing, 
This does not mean that we will be neglecting the need for continued support for primary cooperatives. The initial allocation of R110m to Ithala in the current financial year 
This investment will stimulate economic development along these nodes and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
ACSA to acquire a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a concession within or after the 10 year term; 
This is a significant development, as henceforth governance and risk management issues cutting across all departments will be highlighted at an executive level. 
This pressure on Ithala is a reflection that in SMME finance for the disadvantaged, Ithala is the institution of choice. 
In terms of overall economic growth, according to Stats SA KwaZulu-Natal recorded a growth rate of 4,9 in 2004, second only to the Western Cape at 5,3 and above the national growth rate of 4,5 
Establishment of secondary cooperatives 
which we hope to conclude by December 2006. Award of the contract will follow and it is expected that main construction will commence in March 2007, with facilities to be completed and operational by October 2009. 
But some of you might legitimately ask whether all these government interventions have had a measurable effect on improving the economic performance of the province. 
The Dube TradePort as a statutory public entity will be mandated to drive the trade zone development, the cyberport, the agricultural zone and other associated commercial developments. 
Before the end of June the Department of Economic Development will convene a conference involving representatives of all municipalities to discuss common and coordinated approach to Local Economic Development. 
We must realise that we are dooming the cooperatives and SMMEs we are establishing to failure from the outset unless we follow through by facilitating access to government procurement on a sustainable basis. 
The University of KwaZulu-Natal will also be approached on a similar basis. 
Just to what extent these impressive growth and employment figures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficult to quantify at this stage. 
 we are of the unshakeable view that 
To this end, we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year. 
Many people in the izimbizo reported delays in getting approval  this is simply due to the large volumes of applications. 
Although we have indeed made progress in addressing the central challenges of poverty, unemployment and service backlogs in the past year, much remains to be done in the short, medium and long term. 
Criminal investigations, which will eventually lead to prosecution, are being conducted by the Special Investigation Unit, a division of the National Prosecuting Authority. 
It will apply to both civil engineering works such as airports, runways, bridges, roads etc, as well as general building works. 
which has more than fifty years experience in promoting the growth of small scale industries and business enterprises. We are exploring two areas of cooperation with the NSIC: 
The SEDAs will work in collaboration with Ithala and the Department of Economic Development to provide support services at district level 
and finance, real estate and business services, which grew at 7,9. The manufacturing sector grew at a healthy rate of 4,5. 
 and failure to meet the deadline is not an option  then all role-players will have to play their part, including this Legislature. 
but that BEE-owned companies and emerging contractors enjoy maximum benefit from the contracts put out to tender. Treasury has accordingly developed a standardised infrastructure procurement policy 
We remain determined therefore to fulfil our obligations to the taxpaying citizens of this country by maintaining and indeed improving our high standards in the field of financial management and good governance. 
Treasury took an unprecedented move to engage lawyers to oppose court applications against the Department of Social Welfare, and that saved millions of rands while it uncovered a scam which was draining funds destined for the poor. 
Mr Speaker, Honourable Members, I must stress that if the deadline for the project to be operational by 2009 is to be met 
and other irregularities, amounting to the loss of tens of millions of rands in various departments, public entities and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year. 
in such a way that governments BEE policy and objectives are met. I expect in the coming year to be able to report actual expenditure figures per department on procurement from BEE companies, SMMEs and cooperatives. 
unless at the same time we focus as a government on improving efficiencies and achieving better value for the vast sums of money we spend on these programmes. 
May I remind you again of the words of Alfred lord Tennyson who said: 
We propose to set aside R90 million and R100 million in 2007/08 and 2008/09 respectively for development of the IDZ, 
In the MTEF period, therefore, funding allocations of R50, R55m and R60m have been set aside for the development of soccer at all levels in the province in collaboration with SAFA 
with a toll free number to assist with queries. This will be set up by April this year. 
Progress was also made in enforcing our policy of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption. Six high profile investigations into fraud, corruption, theft, mismanagement, maladministration 
I can say with some confidence that the programmes and economic sectors being prioritised by government, with one or two exceptions, appear to be yielding positive results in terms of performance and trends over the last two years. 
In respect of Performance Budgeting System, the rollout of the system in departments is proceeding on schedule, and demonstration data bases have been installed in Provincial Treasury, Health and Transport. 
that will bring banks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of SMMEs in the Province, thereby relieving the pressure on Ithala. 
The balance of funds required will have to come from debt financing. The Development Bank has already agreed in principle to provide debt funding secured against revenue streams of the project up to R500m. 
income per capita will rise by 50 in the next ten years, and the rate of unemployment will be halved. 
In this regard, government has identified several key projects and programmes as priorities for the forthcoming MTEF. These can be summarised as follows: 
It is unrealistic however, to expect that the provincial economy will launch itself onto a higher growth path on its own accord. A structural growth acceleration of this magnitude will require, 
We have secured a legally binding MoU with ACSA and the National Minister of Transport providing for: 
Site preparation and installation of backbone infrastructure is expected to commence by the end of the calendar year. 
The challenge facing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within planned timeframes, 
and the commissioning of a study by a team of NSIC experts to review the current mechanisms, legislation and policies in the province designed to support SMMEs in the province. 
It is often heard that lengthy delays occur in paying the SMMEs 
When President Mbeki said: Clearly the masses of our people are convinced that our country has entered into its age of Hope, I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say SIYAVUMA. 
based on an average of 9 people per cooperative  many of these have already found employment through their cooperatives or are likely to do so in the near future. 
to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camps. We are also of the view however that we need not just to build soccer stadium infrastructure, but also the sport itself in the province. 
Discussions are also in progress on the financing model for the Trade Port. The total investment required for the airport, which is part of the Trade Port, is about R2.5 billion over the next four to five years. 
70 at Social Welfare; 23 at Home Affairs; 3,979 in other departments; and 15 medical doctors and agents were implicated. 
backbone infrastructure outlay and the development of the N2 interchange. The tenders for this initial site preparation and technical work have already closed and are currently being adjudicated. 
once again well above the national average, and close to the ASGI-SA target of 6. 
The provincial budget will accordingly continue to play a key role as policy instrument to address the socioeconomic challenges confronting us. 
This is concrete proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empowerment. 
Funding in the amount of R50m, R55m and R60,5m has been allocated to the Department of Economic Development for the establishment of secondary and tertiary cooperatives in the MTEF period. 
We have undertaken to cooperate with and assist the South African Women Entrepreneurs in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry. 
This IDZ was proclaimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 2002. Since then, however, there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure outlays required to make the IDZ work.

stimulating economic growth through coordinated infrastructure investment, creating jobs and alleviating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy, and expansion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery. 
and that have sufficient experience and resources 
INTERVENTION THREE: Value for money and good governance initiatives 
It is surely no coincidence, however, that growth in the construction sector is surging, given the provincial governments increased expenditure on infrastructure totalling R7,42 bn over the last two years. 
In this regard, I have tasked the Treasury with establishing a small unit to focus on fast-tracking of payments to cooperatives and SMMEs, 
Sectors in the province which experienced particularly strong growth in 2004 were construction, which grew at a staggering 28,8, 
As at the end of December 2005, Ithala had approved 405 SMME business plans worth R433 million. Of this amount over R179 million has already been disbursed. 
In April 2006 a detailed Request for Proposals will be issued to selected bidders to prepare more detailed bids. By September 2006 a bidder will be selected and detailed negotiations will commence, 
During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R200m to Ithala to drive the SMME programme for the province pending the finalisation of a structured SMME Fund. 
A provincial supply chain management framework policy has been compiled to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to procure goods and services, including from cooperatives, 
In the coming year therefore, we are going to be implementing a new programme to support SMMEs  the details of which I will reveal shortly. 
It should come as no surprise therefore, that the budget expenditure proposals for 2006/07 recommended by Cabinet can be categorized into three broad areas which are consistent with the themes which underpinned last years budget, namely: 
for services rendered and/or supplies provided. 
The consequence of this is the need to expand the Department of Economic Development, with more staff employed to provide support centres in all districts in collaboration with municipal initiatives and to strengthen Local Economic Development. 
and the anticipated savings are as follows: R9,4m savings per month; R113m savings per annum and R338m savings over a 3 year period. Furthermore a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspects: 
- this compares to a growth rate for KZN in 2003 of just 2,8. In 2005 KZNs economic growth rate is projected to be in the region of 5,2, 
We have welcomed the launch of Small Enterprise Development Agency as a brand of DTI to support SMMEs and coops. 
improving the unemployment rate from 33.1 in 2004 to 31.8 in 2005. This decrease in unemployment was in fact faster than the national average, which declined from 27.9 to 26.5 over the same period. 
Creating jobs and alleviating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy 
During the year we invested R80 million in the social welfare grants investigation which has yielded tremendous value to the province. 25,956 fraudulent grants were identified in this investigation 
The deal flow that is currently under consideration by Ithala is standing at R1.5bn. It is safe to suggest that between R500m to R1bn of those deals would be worthy of funding. 
As importantly, the payment process to SMMEs by Government Departments leaves much to be desired. 
 this will have a positive impact on the revival of Ulundi as a regional centre. 
A tertiary cooperative will provide support to cooperatives through apex level institutions. It will also advocate and engage organs of state, the private sector and the stakeholders on behalf of its members. 
The second major infrastructure-related programme being advanced by the provincial government relates to financial support for the development of soccer stadiums in the province in preparation for the 2010 World Cup. 
is that the tertiary cooperative should manage the entire value chain, 
only by uplifting the masses struggling to survive in the second economy will we be able to achieve sustainably higher growth rates over the longer term, and hence our end-goal of prosperity for all. 
The growth of cooperatives requires a major shift in our strategy. Coops are a community movement. For sustainability we need to institutionalise the cooperatives movement. 
Other infrastructure-related strategic projects we propose to fund over the 2006/07 MTEF period are the two road corridors leading to Richards Bay, namely the Lubombo SDI corridor and the P700 linking to Ulundi and ultimately Vryheid. 
Of the approved business plans to date, 328 involve female only cooperatives, 235 youth, 125 male and 96 mixed cooperatives. 
Continued support for small business development 
nor crowd out emerging loan capital, but to complement the existing offerings and provide loan options for those entrepreneurs and small businesses who are presently unable to access affordable loan finance due to a range of factors. 
The full details of the exact nature, purpose and governance framework for the Fund will be set out in the Information Memorandum for the KZN SMME Fund. 
Access to research and technical support for better production processes. 
The business partners and financial institutions who participate in the Fund will by agreement access the existing SMME deal flow generated by Ithala. 
to address the whole agricultural value chain, including marketing, transport, processing, packaging and branding, the provision of technical advice, and support to emerging farmers through the loan of tractors, implements and equipment. 
the USA, the Middle East and Asia. Another objective is 
The initial contribution of R200m from government in the first year of the MTEF will be followed by allocations of R220m and R242m in the outer two years. 
SMALL BUSINESS ARISE!!! 
Agrarian revolution 
The focus of agrarian revolution projects and interventions will be on boosting the capacity of secondary agricultural cooperatives at the district level 
It must be emphasised that the agrarian revolution concept is not only about agriculture. It embraces the whole spectrum of development of our rural areas, 
Applicants who have applied to Ithala for loans should not be surprised therefore if their deals end up being financed by another financial institution 
ABSA has already indicated a willingness to commit R25m to funding small and micro enterprises needing loan finance of less than R3 million. We are also at advanced stages of discussions with Standard Bank and First National. 
This document will form the basis for the participation of any other financial institution in the Fund. 
Access to markets 
Discussions with FNB have not been finalised. Together with a provincial government contribution of R200m which we will make available, the intention is to leverage total funding of over R1,5 bn for the SMME Fund by June 2006. 
Our message is: 
The Fund is designed as a central component of a small enterprise lending framework, which seeks not to compete with other commercial SMME lenders in the market, 
 the important thing is that all SMME business loan applications will be attended to within the coming year. 
Note that the funds will be held against the Vote of the Provincial Treasury pending disbursement to the SMME Fund. 
The objective is to develop the provinces enormous potential in agriculture into a competitive advantage by utilising all of its 590 bio-resource regions to produce vegetables, fruit and meat products for export to Europe, 
A dramatic reduction in farming input costs 
Standard Bank has indicated that subject to agreement on governance arrangements, they will make available R250m for the financing of SMMEs applying for finance between R3m and R30m. 
Another key second economy intervention is that of the agrarian revolution, whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to move subsistence farmers upwards towards the first economy. 
Business Partners in collaboration with Khula, will work with Ithala to open access to Ithala applicants to the R150m start up capital for SMME and BEE funding. 
Access to support for land reform beneficiaries, and 
to reduce the reliance on the importation of basic foodstuffs and to bring down food prices through a comprehensive support programme for emerging farmers which will facilitate: 
Division of revenue framework and revised provincial allocations over the MTEF 
demonstrating governments ongoing commitment to improving the quality and reach of education. The budget includes additional funding in 
'n Ensuring the viability of the land restitution process, through the facilitation of viable programmes for such areas 
and is a first step towards aligning service delivery provision between the local and provincial spheres of government. 
The Department of Community Safety & Liaison receives R50,8 million this year, an increase of 5.5 per cent. As the department received a substantial additional allocation last year, there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget. 
Parliament receives R139,2 million, an increase of 7.6 per cent over the previous year, including an additional allocation over baseline of R15,7 million 
for EMIS, the National Curriculum Statement, ABET, FET Colleges and the introduction of the no fee schools policy. 
the provision for government employees medical scheme to cover those civil servants not covered by medical aid, and the phasing in of the food relief 
Education is allocated a budget of R16,209 billion. The 2006/07 budget represents an increase of 11.7 per cent over last year, 
which provides access to markets 
and antifraud and corruption measures aimed at streamlining the drivers and learners licence system. Note that the department receives very substantial increases in this budget in the outer two years of the MTEF. 
This includes additional funding in the amount of R70 million for maintenance, new road works and access bridges, 
In particular, the unit will work closely with the Department of Economic Development, the Regional Offices of the Land Claims Commission and Land Affairs, and other provincial departments 
Agriculture and Environmental Affairs receives R1,299 billion, an increase of 24.2 per cent. 
Included in this allocation is additional funding in the amount of R31m for coordinating the provision of soccer stadia infrastructure in District Municipalities and the Metro, 
There is a growing need for government to intervene in the second economy through our instrument for economic empowerment, Ithala. While much has been achieved in the last year 
Note that all funding in the Poverty Alleviation Fund has been allocated to specific departments, while specific allocations have also been made to various departments 
Establishment of accelerated economic development unit within Ithala 
I turn now to the expenditure proposals. In line with established practice and sound financial principles, the province is aiming at a balanced budget for the 2006/07 financial year 
In respect of the total budget allocations for the 2006/07 financial year: 
Over and above this, most departments will be receiving additional funding over the MTEF for specific purposes and projects, as indicated in Table 3 in the printed speech. 
with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the 20 major land restitution projects around the province. A Task Team coordinated by the Economic Technical Cluster of Cabinet has already been established 
Treasury has engaged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate model for the planning, coordination, and approval of the agrarian revolution projects. 
while service delivery issues and capacity constraints are also addressed in the budget proposals. 
An amount of R40m will be allocated to the Department of Economic Development in the 2006/07 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit. 
R280 million for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure; 
R50m of this increased allocation is earmarked for the establishment of secondary coops, R100m for primary coops, R30m for the incubator programme, 
Transports budget of R2,416 billion in 2006/07 is an increase of 9.9 per cent over last year. 
R110 million to strengthen the FET colleges; and 
Investing in revival of township economies 
The budget proposals will simultaneously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment, job creation, poverty alleviation, and broader participation in the economy 
from communities and interest groups across the province  we are left with the firm impression that this is truly a budget for the people by the people of the province. 
Note that the amounts per project are the total sum over the three years of the 2006/07 MTEF period. It should also be noted that 
Given the limited resources, substantial reprioritization and tradeoffs had to be made  this is of course the essence of what the budgeting process is all about. 
is the single most important impediment to viability and sustainability, and this aspect will be a major focus area of Ithalas Accelerated Economic Development Unit and the other role-players mentioned. 
Ithala is therefore in the process of establishing a new business unit called Accelerated Economic Development Unit, which will facilitate delivery in the following areas: 
The Department of Sport & Recreation is allocated a budget of R106,1 million, a 19.3 per cent increase over last year. 
and requires a high degree of coordination and cooperation between various provincial departments and district municipalities. The Department of Transports African Renaissance Road Upgrading Programme, 
Once again Minister Trevor Manuel and the Team Finance have provided invaluable advice and guidance on the technical issues and national budget framework which underpin this budget. 
As explained this decrease is attributable to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget. The department nevertheless receives 
Facilitation of new investment and increased trade within the Province 
However, the quality of information received from departments in their budget submissions in terms of their spatial spending and service delivery gaps was relatively incomplete and inadequate. 
The budgeted revenue for 2006/07 is made up as follows: 
the provincial budget actually grows by 13.4 per cent over last years main budget, again excluding the social security grant funding. This is not an inconsiderable increase, 
In his medium term budget policy statement, the Minister of Finance tabled the division of revenue between the three government spheres. 
There are many people who contributed to the budget proposals which we table today. The support provided by the Premier Hon JS Ndebele and my Cabinet Colleagues is most sincerely appreciated. 
Total funding request by departments 
will be collectively spending no less than R3bn over the forthcoming MTEF on combating HIV and AIDS, including the further expansion and rollout of the PMTCT, antiretroviral and home-based care programmes 
Expansion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery 
Health is allocated a budget of R11,737 billion, an increase of 13.1 per cent. This relatively large percentage increase reflects the high priority which government, both national and provincial, 
but Hope smiles at the threshold of the year to come whispering, it will be happier  The 2006/07 Provincial budget process 
For the 2006/07 MTEF, a total of R9,7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments. This is against a total of R4,6 billion available in the provincial resource envelope. 
In short, I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proceed, on schedule, along our journey to prosperity for all. 
Economic Development gets R390,1 million in 2006/07, a 177 per cent increase over last year. Before I am accused of nepotism, let me draw attention to the fact that 
who have once again have played a most constructive role in engaging with Treasury on budgetary and financial management issues. 
KZNs share of additional funding 
The third area which government is prioritising in this budget relates to expanding and improving the quality of existing programmes and projects. Of note are the following allocations: 
and outer two years of the MTEF period. The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 2005/06 financial year, namely R37,192 billion, is allocated to the various provincial departments. 
Before Honourable Members become alarmed, however, I should explain that the decrease is entirely attributable to the removal of the social security conditional grant funding from the provincial budgets altogether 
This exercise revealed that indeed we are funding these national priorities more than adequately, and all the national priority programmes have been allocated healthy increases in their baseline budgets over the 2006/07 MTEF. 
in accordance with their legislative mandates and any sector-specific norms and standards. 
It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget submissions. If nothing else, this approach has brought about a change in the mindset of departments 
For the 2006/07 financial year, the province is budgeting for total revenue of R37,191 billion. This represents a decrease of 18,4 per cent as compared to last years main budget. 
EPWP and BBBEE principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and maintenance-related projects. 
This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department, in the amount of R18,9 million, as well as R4m for the carry-through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate. 
R290 million for Adult Basic Education & Training; 
in terms of the number of new entrepreneurs entering the market, there is a need to create better focus within Ithala in order to accelerate delivery in this all important empowerment initiative. 
The Royal Household receives R31,4 million in 2006/07, an increase of 13.8 per cent over last year. 
to R13,832 bn in 2006/07 compared to R12,771 bn in the current year. 
additional funding totalling R97,5m as a result of the phasing in of the Food Relief and HIV and AIDS grants. Although not in our budget the conditional grant for social assistance grants 
I am confident however that we have succeeded in formulating budget proposals which truly reflect the provincial policy priorities as approved by the provincial executive, and will go a long way towards satisfying the aspirations of popular expectations. 
and the HIV and AIDS conditional grants into the equitable share. For 2006/07, R397 million is available for discretionary spending, rising to R3.2 billion in 2008/09.

The number of beneficiaries in year 2000/01 was 621,494 compared to 1,836,975 in year 2004/05. 
for the carry-through costs of the Adjustments Estimate allocations last year, and R9,5m and R6,7m for catering for cultural affairs and office administrative costs respectively. 
R58 million to develop communal agricultural infrastructure; 
The social services are once again prioritised in terms of the growth rates in their MTEF allocations, 
The purpose of this spatial exercise was to move towards attaining a comprehensive economic alignment strategy for the province, by trying to identify provincial departments spending 
for coordinating soccer development in the province in collaboration with SAFA, as well the additional allocations already referred to for extra capacity in the executive council secretarial services,

from the Provincial Growth Fund for strategic provincial projects such as the Dube Trade Port, Richards Bay IDZ and infrastructure for the 2010 Soccer World Cup. 
Note the additional allocations made in the two outer years of the MTEF for the establishment of sporting and recreation facilities. 
The Department of Social Welfare and Populations budget decreases from R13,605 bn last year to R895m  a decrease of no less than 93.4 per cent. 
The unit will create capacity to deliver on the above areas and thus realising government objectives of reducing poverty and unemployment.

Promotion of commercial, as well as viable subsistence farming in previously disadvantaged communities 
Mr Speaker, I turn now to the detail of the provincial budget proposals for the 2006/07 MTEF. 
Mr Speaker, we remain committed for example to continue waging a relentless campaign to combat the ravaging effects of the HIV and AIDS syndrome on our society. To this end provincial departments 
And demanding, because putting budgets together, which involves making informed choices and matching limited resources against competing needs and demands, is never an easy process. 
for the carry- through costs of the 2005/06 adjustments estimate, new posts and IT support and systems. 
I also wish to extend my thanks to the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Portfolio Committee, Mr Cyril Xaba and his Committee, 
Mr Speaker, compiling these budget proposals has been both a pleasurable and demanding task. Pleasurable, in that there has been tremendously positive input and advice received 
R29m for the Community Development Workers programme, R24,1 million for Project Consolidate, Disaster Management Centres and the Rural Connectivity Programme, 
The Housing budget records a substantial leap to R1,252 billion, an increase of no less than 29.1 per cent over last year. 
and there is little doubt that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliver on its mandate to the electorate. 
 this funding has been transferred to the newly established Social Security Agency at a national level. Taking out the social security grant funding of some R13,8bn in 2006/07, 
The Department of Works receives R451,5 million this year, an increase of 6.0 per cent over the 2005/06 budget. 
This includes additional funding of R110m as mentioned for the agrarian revolution programme, 
The main reason for the decrease is that Treasury will no longer have the centralised Poverty Alleviation Fund held against its budget, 
The Provincial Treasury receives R1,069 billion, a nominal decrease of 1.8 per cent over last years main budget. 
The primary focus of the 2006/07 Treasury Guidelines was on the review and reprioritisation of departments budgets, as well as on an analysis of their spatial spending and service delivery in each district municipality. 
The expenditure framework provides for R31 billion in additional equitable share allocation to the provinces over the MTEF. 
while even the balance of the Provincial Growth Fund and SMME Fund will only be housed in Treasurys budget on a temporary basis, pending approval of projects and consequent transfer of funds to the Ithala 
 this is the total expenditure across the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Education. The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty alleviation programmes in their respective budget documentation. 
The Department of Arts, Culture and Tourism receives a budget of R254,7 million, a 21.6 per cent increase over last year. This includes an additional allocation of R18,7 million 
with the mandate to ensure that the commercial enterprises earmarked for the major land restitution projects such as game farming and ecotourism, 
R40m for the Accelerated Development Unit in Ithala, and R20m for the Dube Trade Port. Previously these funds were kept in Treasury before they were transferred to Ithala. 
Mr Speaker, I have dealt at length with the major policy priorities and therefore I wish to briefly explain the division of revenue and MTEF framework which underpins this provincial budget. 
The Office of the Premier is allocated R 294,7 million, an increase of 35.1 per cent over the 2005/06 budget. This large increase is mainly attributable to an allocation of R50m 
The Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs gets R595,6 million, a 29.9 per cent increase. 
Other key role-players include the Departments of Economic Development, Housing, Arts, Culture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land Claims Commission. 
We are also recommending additional allocations in order to help departments increase their internal capacity and improve service delivery. 
continues to accord to the delivery of social services, and includes an additional allocation of R24,6 million for improving maintenance in hospitals. 
Mr Speaker, I want to emphasise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for allocation should be apportioned among departments and programmes, we did a comprehensive costing and benchmarking exercise 
Expenditure proposals and departmental allocations 
This allocation will also support the regulatory activities of the Gambling Board. A request from the Department of Housing for additional capacity has also been recommended to support various initiatives such as training of housing beneficiaries. 
Table 1 in the printed speech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further allocation, taking into account projected provincial own revenue and two national policy directives;

A Peoples Guide. 
The expanded in governments infrastructure public works programme began projects and in the delivery of in 2004/05. 
We all have a role to play in making sure money is not wasted by any of our civil servants. We must combine our efforts in working together toward our economic recovery. 
Despite governments best efforts, meeting the needs of all South Africans will be tougher over the period ahead. Government officials must remain mindful of the fact that our resources belong to all South Africans. 
The main areas in the budget that receive more money are: 
It describes how government will raise money and how it will be spent. The national budget divides money between national departments, provinces and municipalities. Budget highlights on page 4. 
because in previous years we handled our finances with discipline. We saved money when our economy was doing well. As a result, we can increase spending on public services without hurting our economy. 
R6.4 billion more for public transport, national roads and rail infrastructure 
In February of each year, the Minister of Finance announces governments spending, tax and borrowing plans for the next three years. This is called the national budget. 
From 2009, government kicks off a new phase of the expanded public works programme.

Construction, maintenance and environmental protection projects 
The world economy is in a worse position than it has been in several decades. According to a report by the International Labour Organisation, more than million people could lose their jobs this year 
Government spending will continue to grow on services that help poor communities, and public works programmes which will create more new jobs. 
Over R780 billion will be spent on large infrastructure projects over the next three years, including building more power stations, roads and railways, upgrading water and sanitation networks 
Government aims to increase the number of full time equivalent jobs to 400 000 a year by 2014, helping to bring down poverty and unemployment. 
South Africa is not as badly affected, and we want to keep it that way. In fact, we want to do better so that we can continue to provide for the needs of our people. 
When the economy grows at a slower rate, governments collect less taxes. This means that government will have to borrow to meet some of its spending commitments.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HIJACKINGS 
HIJACKING PREVENTION 
The publication of the Bill for comment therefore represents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders, interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act. 
The questions are often raised  why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation  is the coast not simply part of the general environment 
The review concluded that a dedicated Coastal Management Act was required for implementing the White Paper. 
This chapter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Minister and the MECs. 
The coast is a unique part of the environment. It is the meeting place of the land and sea  a limited spatial area that supports many human activities. 
Section 25 authorises MECs to establish coastal setback lines. 
The Act also requires municipalities to develop municipal CMPs within four years of the Acts commencement, either as stand alone documents or as part of an integrated development plan prepared in accordance with the Municipal Systems Act. 
In the past, the value of coastal ecosystems as a cornerstone for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in decision-making in South Africa. 
The Bill intends to regulate the discharge of effluent into coastal waters from any source on land by requiring permits to authorise such discharges. 
However, it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the Protected Areas Act rather than the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act. 
The purpose of this Guide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period. 
The White Paper did not merely provide a vision, principles, goals and objectives for coastal management in South Africa. 
This chapter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all estuaries by providing that they must be managed, in accordance with: a 
INTRODUCTION 
Chapter 5: Institutional arrangements 
indicates to whom and where the Act applies and explains that the Act must be read in conjunction with the National Environmental Management Act and explains how to reconcile conflicts with other legislation. 
Seafront development needs to be located behind the littoral active zone - a hazardous area for development. 
For coastal development to be socially sustainable, it should emphasise public awareness and shared responsibility, empowering disadvantaged individuals and communities, including women and the poor. 
The coast is a distinctive system in which a range of considerations  biophysical, economic, social and institutional  interconnect, in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach. 
MANAGEMENT BILL 
This chapter provides measures for protecting the coastal environment from activities that may detrimentally affect it and creates procedures for assessing and regulating such activities. 
to declare that protected areas or parts thereof are not part of the buffer zone. 
In order to protect and effectively regulate coastal public property, it is also necessary to impose controls and restrictions on certain areas adjacent to coastal public property that form part of coastal ecosystems. 
The coast needs to be managed as a system in order to make optimal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides. 
into the existing provincial and municipal land-based and economic development planning procedures in a manner that is consistent with the policy goals of the White Paper. 
Section 60 authorises the Minister or MEC to issue notices for the repair or removal of structures within the coastal zone. 
Section 38 provides for the establishment of Provincial Coastal Committees which will be responsible for coordinating coastal management in each province. Section 39 authorizes the MECs of each province to determine the composition of these Committees. 
Much of the wealth locked up in our coast continues to be wasted due to environmentally insensitive development and activities. Economic and social opportunities for wealth creation and equity are being missed and coastal ecosystems are being degraded. 
Chapter 10: Enforcement 
The text of the Bill is available from the Government Printer or can be downloaded from http://www.deat.gov.za/. 
set coastal management objectives and include priorities and strategies for achieving these and performance indicators that can be used to measure progress. 
In order to secure public access to coastal public property, the Bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land. 
A coastal setback line may, for example, be established to ensure that the shadows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise. 
In practice this means, for example, that the Minister must ensure that there is consistency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans. 
Includes: vision, national coastal management objectives. 
COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME 
for establishing special management arrangements in a particular area in order to give effect to the recognition in the White Paper that the diversity of the coast requires different management approaches in different areas. 
The preamble explains the rationale or basis for promulgating the proposed Integrated Coastal Management Act. Several factors forming part of this basis are discussed above. 
Part 5 contains general provisions relating to the temporary occupation of land within the coastal zone for specified purposes and the amendment, suspension or cancellation of authorisations. 
WHY IS THERE A NEED FOR A NATIONAL COASTAL MANAGEMENT ACT? 
Chapter 8: Marine and coastal pollution control 
Once such a line has been established in a zoning scheme, any person who wishes to erect or alter a structure situated seaward of the line must obtain permission before doing so. 
Sets local policy, strategy & CMOs. 
Reasons for withdrawing such designation could include instances where the use of coastal access land is causing damage to the environment. The process for designating or withdrawing the designation of coastal access land is described in section 19. 
White Paper is regarded as first NCMP 
THE INTEGRATED COASTAL 
Such amendment, suspension or cancellation is subject to the criteria specified in section 73. 
Sets provincial coastal management policy and strategy consistent with MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES 
Chapter 6: Coastal management 
The White Paper recommended new arrangements to coordinate coastal management in South Africa. 
Section 49 requires the alignment of certain plans with CMPs to ensure coordinated coastal management. Similarly section 50 requires consistency between CMPs and other statutory plans. 
Pending the determination of an appeal, the Minister or MEC may make an interim order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. 
The powers of the Minister and the MECs to review provincial and municipal CMPs respectively are set out in sections 53-54. 
A permit is also required in order to undertake certain non-consumptive, commercial uses of coastal public property or the exclusive economic zone in order to provide a mechanism for 
It sets out the legal mechanisms for establishing a proactive planning system for coastal areas that integrates coastal concerns 
This is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jointly by several organs of State instead of many separate authorisations. 
The purpose of a panel is to ensure that the consideration of an appeal is informed by technical expertise where this is required. 
Sets national coastal management policy and strategy. 
Management Protocol approved by the Ministers responsible for the environment and for water affairs; and estuarine management plans for individual estuaries. 
This chapter establishes integrated procedures for regulating the disposal of effluent and waste into estuaries and the sea. 
This chapter establishes a statutory framework for new institutional arrangements to ensure integrated and coordinated coastal management. 
The reason for this is that some protected areas extend sufficiently far inland so as to make it logical to exclude them from the scope of the proposed Act. 
specially protected coastal areas, and includes any aspect of the environment on, in and above them. 
This Chapter is designed to extend that system across the land/sea interface in order to allow for integrated coastal planning and the proactive control of the use of coastal resources. 
This chapter sets out the procedures to be followed when appealing against coastal protection or repair and removal notices or in connection with the granting or refusal of a permit under the Act. 
The Bill focuses on regulating human activities within, or that affect the coastal zone. 
Certain land will be regarded as coastal access land when the Bill is enacted but the designation of coastal access land may also be withdrawn or cancelled. 
The White Paper also emphasizes the importance of facilitating coastal development which is sustainable. This requires development to be ecologically, socially and economically sustainable. 
national CMP. 
It also sets out the considerations which must apply in respect of such demarcations and adjustments. Interested and affected parties have an opportunity to contribute to the process of demarcating or adjusting boundaries. 
The Bill authorises the Minister to dispense with prescribed procedure in respect of dumping in emergencies. For example, vessels in distress due to mechanical failure may need to urgently dump cargo overboard. 
The Bill provides procedures relating to both discharge and dumping permits. 
This Part also provides strict guidelines for decision-making which the permit issuing authority must consider. 
Section 57 requires users of coastal public property, owners and occupiers of land, coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adverse effects on the coastal environment 
The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CMPs withinfour years of the commencement of the Act that are consistent with the national CMP and the National Estuarine Management Protocol. 
Protected areas or parts thereof are automatically included in the buffer zone in terms of Section 16. The purpose of section 22 is to enable the MEC 
Part 4 deals with the letting of coastal public property by way of coastal leases and the granting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal concessions. 
This contrasts with the current situation under the Seashore Act where the seashore and sea are owned by the President on behalf of the people.Coastal public property is made up primarily of the seashore and coastal waters. 
After the Cabinet approved the White Paper a comprehensive legal review was carried out. Its purpose was to determine whether the White Paper could be implemented in terms of existing laws. 
Early drafts of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas. 
Section 35 establishes a National Coastal Committee which will function at national government level. Section 36 authorizes the Minister to determine the composition of the Committee. 
Section 40 authorizes the MECs to appoint Voluntary coastal officers and define their roles and responsibilities. 
The protocol will provide a national policy for estuary management and guide the development of individual estuarine management plans. 
Demarcation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal buffer zone are only likely to be instituted where the area designated by the Act is inappropriate and impedes effective coastal management. 
This provision helps facilitate a new cooperative and participatory approach to managing the coast by enhancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management. 
Includes: vision, provincial CMOs. 
The coastal resource use planning system established by this Chapter will function as a mechanism for controlling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is presently used. 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental factors. 
It took a step further by providing a Plan of Action which outlines in detail how the White Paper is to be implemented. One of the elements of this Plan of Action is Institutional and Legal Development. 
However, this system  orientated approach has failed to materialize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach focusing 
Coastal waters are essentially all waters influenced by tides and the sea out to the limits of the territorial sea. 
rather than as conservation areas. For example, special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable harvesting of shellfish for subsistence purposes in areas where such harvesting is presently depleting the shellfish resources. 
Section 59 provides for the Minister or MEC to issue written notices requiring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment. 
The Minister pointed out that due to its complexity the Bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days. 
This Bill promotes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management, which views the coast as a system and emphasizes the importance of managing it as such. 
The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estimated in 1998 to be about R168 billion annually, which was equivalent to about 35 of our annual Gross Domestic Product. 
Chapter 4: Estuaries 
Section 37 provides for the designation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level. 
Restricting or controlling developments in these areas is also essential to take account of the dynamic nature of the coast 
Parliament requires the publication for public comment of Bills in the Government Gazette before such Bills are introduced in Parliament for the purpose of promulgating them as legally binding Acts. 
Part 2 
Chapter 3: Boundaries of coastal areas 
This chapter defines important words and terms, sets out the objectives of the proposed Act in order to guide the interpretation and application of the Act, clarifies the role of the State in relation to the coastal environment, 
The Bill also establishes a prohibition of incineration or dumping at sea of waste or other material. 
Fig. 2. Coastal Management Programmes a national coastal management programme has been adopted in accordance with section 41. 
For coastal development to be ecologically sustainable, it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources. 
The authorisation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment. 
Part 3 prohibits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit. 
For coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diversify opportunities, provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources.

A special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes, and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas, 
Section 68 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for granting permits for the use of coastal resources while maintaining a high level of environmental protection. 
The current land-use planning system in South Africa is a land-based system that essentially stops at the high water mark. 
The Bill requires the Minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment. 
A brief guide to assist the public participation process environment & tourism Department: 
THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL 
This resulted, for example, in car-parks being located in dynamic dune areas characterized by drift-sand movement or in areas subject to serious erosion during storm seas. 
Assessing the environmental impact of activities which may detrimentally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were promulgated in terms of NEMA on 21 April 2006. 
Presently the disposal of effluent through pipelines and the dumping of waste from vessels into estuaries or the sea are controlled under different pieces of legislation by different Departments. 
The White Paper highlights the importance of recognising the value of the coast. 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20. In the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors. 
Chapter 7 Protection of Coastal Resources 
The purpose of sections 31 and 32 is to provide for the formalizing in law of such determinations and adjustments through the marking of boundaries on zoning maps and endorsements by the Registrar of Deeds. 
and gives the Minister, an MEC or a municipality the power to institute legal proceedings or take other measures in relation to coastal public property or the coastal environment. 
May enact bylaws to give effect to municipal CMP. 
This Guide then briefly explains the purpose of each chapter of the Bill and provides an outline of its content. 
It empowers the Minister or MEC either to consider the appeal personally or to appoint an appeal panel to determine the appeal. 
Section 23 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 deals with the management of such areas. This is intended to provide a mechanism 
Preamble 
Chapter 9: Appeals 
At the heart of the coastal zone is an area of land and water defined as coastal public property, which is the common property of the people of South Africa. 
Importantly, it will provide a mechanism for translating the results of research regarding how coastal resources should be used 
When the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament South Africa will for the first time have a national Coastal Management Act in place for managing our coastal zone, a priceless national asset. 
During the first week of December 2006 the Cabinet approved the publication in the Government Gazette of the Integrated Coastal Management Bill for public comment. In a press release issued on 8 December 2006, 
Chapter 11: General Ministerial powers and duties 
The Bill does not seek to introduce new environmental impact assessment procedures. 
Chapter 1: Interpretation, objectives and application of act 
The Guide seeks to achieve this by first explaining the historical context leading to the publication in 2000 of the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa which provided a national policy for managing our coastline. 
in accordance with section 28 of the National Environmental Management Act, referred to below as NEMA. Section 58 stipulates the requirements which apply to the authorisation of activities causing adverse effects. 
and is it not already covered by existing environmental legislation? Answers to these questions are discussed below. 
The coastal zone is illustrated in Figure 1 and defined as the area comprising coastal public property, the coastal buffer zone, coastal access land, 
on their specific sectors such as land-use planning, agriculture, water affairs, nature conservation and others. 
These national, provincial and municipal CMPs must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover, 
Procedures relating to public participation in respect of decision-making in accordance with the proposed Act are set out in sections 51-52. 
COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES 
Marthinus Van Schalkwyk, the Minister of Environmental Affairs & Tourism, announced that the Bill would be gazetted on 15 December 2006. 
This is in line with the Constitutional imperatives that government ensures accountability, responsiveness and openness. 
Section 55 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish zoning schemes. Section 56 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal zoning schemes. 
This chapter provides procedures for demarcating and adjusting the boundaries of coastal public property, the coastal buffer zone, special management areas and coastal access land. 
Chapter 2: The coastal zone 
This chapter establishes certain offences, determines penalties in respect of offences, provides for offences under the Act to be prosecuted in the magistrates court

Part 2 describes the powers to be exercised by the Minister and MEC. Section 92 grants the Minister the power to exercise certain functions normally exercised by the MEC if specific circumstances apply. 
A chapter of the Bill focuses on estuaries which are much sought after for recreation 
Part 1 deals with the powers of the Minister and of MECs to make regulations to promote the Acts implementation and prescribes the consultative process that is to be followed when making regulations. 
These include provisions dealing with the continuation of existing leases on, or rights to, coastal public property, the procedures for dealing with unlawful structures on coastal public property,

and the continuation of existing lawful activities in the coastal buffer zone that were lawful before the commencement of the Act but that after its commencement may only be conducted with a permit. 
Part 4 deals with certain General matters. Section 97 deals with Information and reporting on coastal matters. The Minister must make certain information concerning the protection and management of the coastal zone available to the public. 
The Chapter establishes a hierarchy of coastal management programmes. At the top of the hierarchy is the national CMP which the Minister must

provide a legal basis for applying the principles and achieving the goals and objectives set out in the White Paper? 
The above publications are available on the following websites: 
generally or specifically give adequate legal effect to the policy in the White Paper? 
adjust public and private rights to own and use the coast to ensure that they do not conflict with the implementation of the policy in the White Paper? 
support the new holistic coordinated and integrated coastal management approach that is central to the White Paper? 
These will be primarily related to the new function of preparing comprehensive coastal management programmes. 
provide for the use of economic instruments, as recommended in the White Paper, to support the achievement of the policy objectives? 
However these costs should be dwarfed by the benefits derived from improved allocation of coastal resources and streamlined management systems.

SECTION 2: KEY ELEMENTS 
This is the finalisation of a process that started in 1995, when I appointed the Language Plan Task Group to advise me on a framework for a coherent language policy and plan. 
Capacity building in the identified areas of language facilitation will take place in close collaboration with service providers such as tertiary institutions offering SAQA-accredited programmes 
Refers to the choice of a particular language in a particular situation, multilingualism determined by the context in which the language is used, i.e. the function, the audience and the message for which it is employed. 
in collaboration with my Advisory Panel on Language Policy. The policy framework is fundamental to the management of our diverse language resources 
I am particularly proud that, after a thorough process of consultation, we are finally in a position to announce a framework for a language policy for South Africa. 
encourage the learning of other official indigenous languages to promote national unity, and linguistic and cultural diversity; and promote good language management for efficient public service administration to meet client expectations and needs.

It is in this spirit that the promotion of all 11 official languages of our country, as provided for in the Constitution, takes centre stage in the policy. 
Language awareness 
and the growing criticism from language stakeholders of the tendency towards unilingualism in South Africa. 
The Constitution and related legislation clearly advocate the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa. This policy framework

The language policy is based on the following principles: 
At least one from the Sotho group; 
Section 6 of the Constitution provides the principal legal framework for multilingualism, the development of the official languages and the promotion of respect 
I believe that collectively we have to ensure that the policy becomes a reality in our lives, affirming and making us proud of our unique South African identity.

All government structures, as well as institutions exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of legislation are bound by this Language Policy Framework. 
There is currently a strong awareness of the need to intensify efforts to develop the previously marginalised indigenous languages and to promote multilingualism

When a language loses its value in these spheres the status of the language diminishes. This Policy Framework also takes into account that we are faced with the challenge of globalisation 
The progressive phasing in of the implementation of the policy in the short, medium and long term is the preferred strategy at all levels.

Lexicography 
The establishment of language units in each national government department and in each province will also impact on the scope of the activities of the National Language Service. 
The approach recognises the following: 
ensure redress for the previously marginalised official indigenous languages; 
The NLS will be required to coordinate the management of policy implementation by facilitating training for language unit staff in language planning activities and support of the work programmes of these units.

The Department of Education introduced a Language in Education Policy, which stresses multilingualism as an extension of cultural diversity and an integral part of building a non-racial South Africa. 
The scope or provisions of the policy are as follows:

diversity and to the challenges of constitutional multilingualism, hence the introduction of this National Language Policy Framework. 
In terms of the Constitution, all languages are to receive equal respect. 
Additional government responsibilities regarding the implementation of the national language policy are as follows: 
All oral communication must take place in the preferred official language of the target audience. If necessary, every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as interpreting where practically possible. 
Supporting the development of human resources required for successful implementation of multilingualism; 
SECTION 1 
Other relevant provisions pertaining to language matters are made elsewhere in the Constitution. Section 9 protects against unfair discrimination on the grounds of language, 
Regarding government publications, implementation will be phased in flexibly and pragmatically by government structures over a period of at least three years.

Scope 
Deleted: This situation was reversed with the advent of democracy in 1994 and the Constitutional provisions on official multilingualism. 
To date management of linguistic diversity in post-apartheid South Africa has been made problematic by the lack of a clearly defined language policy, 
Department of Education

education, legal and administrative systems, etc.; and by generally providing scope for the publication of literary works in that language. 
The right to use the official languages of our choice has therefore been recognised in our Bill of Rights, and our Constitution acknowledges that the languages of our people are a resource that should be harnessed. 
In promoting multilingualism provinces will formulate their policies in line with the guidelines contained in this Policy Framework, taking into account their regional circumstances, and the needs and preferences of communities, as stated in the Constitution. 
Interpreting 
This step was essential in view of the lack of tolerance for linguistic diversity and the resultant multilingualism is a costly problem approach evident in some sectors of our society,

the establishment of the SA Language Practitioners Council, a Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa, a strategy for the development of the previously marginalised languages and an HLT Strategy. 
Terminology 
Bilingualism 
For the purposes of conducting meetings or performing specific tasks every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as translation and/or interpreting where practically possible. 
A community-based approach to the promotion of multilingualism is the most viable one, given South Africas highly pluralistic society. 
South Africa is therefore a multilingual country. A striking characteristic of multilingualism in South Africa is the fact that several indigenous languages are spoken across provincial borders; shared by speech communities from different provinces.

Its easier said than done, but try to remain calm. Report the case at your nearest SAPS station or dial 10111. 
Make sure your child always checks with you before going anywhere with anyone. 
What to do if your child disappears 
Do not play in deserted areas such as empty playgrounds, parks, construction sites or dumps. 
Always let your parents know when you arrive home safely. 
Make sure your child learns his or her address and phone number at an early age. A second phone number of a friend or relative is also helpful. 
What parents can do:

general effective date means the date on which the provisions mentioned in item 2 took effect;

The following section is hereby inserted after section 141 :
An individual who, immediately before the early effective date, was employed by the State, assigned to the Department of Trade and Industry and tasked with administration or enforcement of any of the repealed laws, is an employee of Commission, as of the effective date, subject to the Public Service Act, 1994. The transfer of departmental employees to the Commission must be effected in accordance with section 197 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995;
Subsection does not apply in respect of 25 any negotiation, by an attorney on behalf of a consumer, with the credit provider concerned;

, or the Consumer Protection Act, 2008;
or the transaction is between two parties who are part of the supply chain if the value of the transaction falls above a threshold prescribed by the Minister.
Currently, business name registration is optional, serving to protect businesses from other persons encroaching on a trading identity.
It also prohibits informing consumers that they have won a prize when no competition has been conducted, or they have never entered a competition, or making the prize subject to a previously undisclosed condition payment of any consideration, whether for participating in the competition or for the prize itself.
The equality court is recognised as having exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate contraventions of this part in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act.
The Minister may make regulations to set deposits of containers, pallets and similar objects to be refunded to the consumer when they return it to the supplier.
Clause 26 makes it compulsory for sales records of every transaction to be provided to the consumer and prescribes the information that must be contained in a sales record.
Therefore, the Bill proposes a significant change in the current business name registration scheme by making it mandatory rather than voluntary.
Such goods, when delivered, must correspond with the description or sample, or the consumer has a limited right to return them under clause 20.
The laws that will be repealed, as set out in clause 121 and the consequential amendments, are :
The Bill recognises that consumer protection is a matter that falls under the functional area of concurrent jurisdiction between provincial and national government in terms of Schedule 4 to the Constitution.
and intervening in any matter before any forum contemplated in this Act if the interest of consumers represented by that group are not otherwise adequately represented in that forum.
This particularly applies to circumstances where the consumer is buying on the basis of a description or sample.
Right to fair value, good quality and safety
Repeal and replacement of current laws
Under the existing regulatory framework, the Consumer Affairs Act, 1988, and various other laws regulate consumer protection.
This includes commissions earned, and entities whom they represent.
This will harmonise this Bill with other laws that require differential treatment, for example, the prohibition of sales of alcohol to under-age minors.
Under the Bill, a person who carries on business may only do that in the persons own full name as recorded in an official form of identification, registered name or a registered alternative business name. Trade catalogues and circulars have to reflect that name, description of the business and statement of the place where it is carried on.
In respect of lay-bys it provides that suppliers are accountable for amounts paid by consumers for lay-bys, and that the goods remain at the risk of the supplier.
Clause 36 prohibits offering prizes with the intention of not providing them.
In addition, accredited consumer protection groups have a right to be consulted in respect of any proposed industry code of practice, and any proposed regulations.
The Minister has authority to exempt certain categories of transaction from that requirement.
Right to honest and fair dealing
The right to choose includes the right to decide whether or not to continue a commercial arrangement during the course of an agreement, and once it has expired.
Unconscionable conduct, force, coercion, undue influence, pressure or harassment, unfair tactics or conduct is prohibited in connection with any marketing, supply, negotiation, collection or recovery of goods from consumers.
Persons who attend at a consumers place of business or residence to deliver or install any goods, or perform any services, must wear satisfactory identification.
If goods are reconditioned that has to be disclosed, and if they have been imported without the benefit of the manufacturers warranty, that fact must be disclosed.
A number of specific marketing and selling practices are prohibited, including bait marketing, negative options and referral selling.
Suppliers are prohibited from requiring consumers to purchase bundled goods or services as described in clause 13, unless it can be proven that the bundling results in economic benefit for consumers.
The right to equal access to the consumer market
Suppliers are obligated under the Bill to accept the return of waste goods that may not be accepted in the common waste collection system.
The right to equal access expands on and is conceptually linked to both the Bill of Rights and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000. It protects communities, districts, market segments or populations from being unfairly discriminated against with regards to access to goods or services of different quality or pricing.
Clause 39 addresses the legal status of agreements between suppliers and persons who lack legal capacity to enter into such an agreement.
Right to be heard and obtain redress The Bill aims to make redress accessible, and to protect consumers from being victimised if they act to enforce their rights.
It is not to displace or over-ride more specific schemes of consumer protection established in terms of any industry-specific law.
Clause 69 outlines the available avenues of redress, including the courts, alternative dispute resolution, and complaint to the Commission.
Consumers who are approached by direct marketers often feel psychologi-cally pressured to agree to a transaction.
The Bill codifies a number of fundamental consumer rights, as discussed below.
The Bill seeks to advance that right with the following provisions :
Unreasonable transactions as described in clause 48 are prohibited, as are unjust or unfair terms or conditions.
determination of steps to be taken to ensure the performance of a particular function by a provincial consumer protection authority, in the case where no provincial consumer protection authority has been established;
Right to fair and responsible marketing
In terms of clause 61, a producer, distributor or supplier of a good is strictly liable for any harm wholly or partly caused as a consequence of product defect or failure, with certain exceptions.
It will also permit the common practice of discounted prices for children, or for persons over a certain age, and will permit the continued use of separate facilities for different genders.
Finally, clause 67 requires suppliers to return parts and materials remaining from maintenance work.
This Bill proposes to repeal several laws replacing them with a single Consumer Protection Act, which will also give priority to its own procedures for enforcement and will modify the common law in several respects.
Because that sort of agreement is often not an exercise of free choice, clause 16 establishes the consumers right to cancel such an agreement without penalty during a brief cooling-off period of five business days.
The Bill is intended to provide a general default regime of consumer protection.
Right to fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions
The Minister may exempt certain transactions or services below a certain threshold.
The Bill promotes consumer activism.
Meaning of transaction and consumer
In order to enhance consumer choice the Bill introduces a number of provisions that are aimed at assisting consumers to select goods or services on the basis of having examined the goods and compared prices.
The right of consumers to privacy includes the right to accept, refuse or block any approach for the purpose of direct marketing.
To restrain or correct the worst abuses in the area of the marketing of goods or services, the Bill introduces or re-enacts a number of provisions to address the following matters :
The Minister may prescribe the information or records that intermediaries or categories of intermediaries must keep.
It further requires the supplier to compensate the consumer if the supplier is unable to produce the goods once the full price has been paid by the consumer.
To this end, the Bill provides for the Minister to consult the Members of the Provincial Executive Councils responsible for consumer affairs with respect to the co-ordination and harmonisation of the functions of the Commission and the provincial consumer protection authorities;
The right to disclosure aims to ensure that consumers understand the terms and conditions of the transactions or agreements they enter into and are able to make informed choices about the products and services they consume.
A supplier or a person acting on his or her behalf is prohibited from making false, misleading or deceptive representations in respect of any goods and services under the circumstances listed in clause 41.
In addition, if the consumer had informed the supplier of the use he wants to put the goods to, the consumer has the right to expect that it will be suitable for that particular purpose.
An ombud, consumer court or provincial authority that has resolved a complaint may record the agreement as an order, which must then be confirmed as a consent order by the courts.
The right to choose encompasses the consumers right to examine goods.
The Bill imposes an obligation on the supplier to issue alerts of any activity or facility that is subject to any hazard that could result in serious injury or death to consumers;
Trade descriptions applied to any goods must not be misleading, and must not be tampered with. The Minister may prescribe categories of goods to which a trade description must be applied.
The Bill replaces the current Lottery Act scheme for regulating promotional competitions.
To this end consumers have the following rights :
Suppliers accountability to consumers
The Bill sets out standards for fair and responsible marketing and provides a general prohibition against marketing that is misleading, fraudulent or deceptive, as described in clause 35.
To further protect consumers, the Minister may prescribe certain days, dates and times during which it is prohibited to contact consumers for promotional purposes.
There is a prohibition against overselling and overbooking, which requires a supplier not to accept consideration for any goods or services unless they reasonably expect to have capacity to supply them or intend to provide goods or services that are materially different. Consumers have to be refunded in full with interest and consumers can also claim contractual and consequential damages, including economic losses.
The liability provided for in the Bill is in addition to any other liability of that person in terms of any law, and extends to loss arising from death, illness or injury, or loss or damage to any property.
Clause 58 provides guidance to the courts with regards to how they should assess unconscionable conduct, unfair, unjust or unreasonable contract terms, or deal with prohibited contract terms.
If an advertisement or notice states that prices are subject to a reduction or sale price, clause 23 provides for a consistent application of such notices, so that consumers can better compare prices in a consistent fashion.
If the sponsor of a loyalty programme keeps a register of members, the sponsor may increase the price of rewards only after notifying the members.
or a franchisee in terms of a franchise agreement.
The definition of consumer is extended to the actual users of goods or services, regardless of who actually may have conducted a transaction or paid for the goods or services.
The Bill makes it compulsory to display prices for any goods that are displayed for sale.
The right to choose also includes the right of the consumer to cancel advance reservations or bookings, but suppliers may charge advance deposits and impose reasonable cancellation penalties.
Registration of business names
The dti believes that consumers have a right, and need, to be able to ascertain the identity of the legal person with whom they are dealing.
or the Minister has concluded that the existing provincial consumer protection authority is unable to perform that function effectively.
Upfront disclosure for preparing an estimate is also required.
Therefore, clause 5 provides for the Minister to grant industry-wide exemptions from the application of specific provisions of this Bill on the request of a relevant industry regulator, if the National Consumer Commission advises that the specific industry scheme offers at least as much protection for consumers as they would have under this Bill.
The Bill recognises the role of civil society in consumer protection by providing for the support of any juristic person or association of persons that meet the set criteria as consumer protection groups.
Consumer Affairs Act, 1988 Trade Practices Act, 1976 Sale and Service Matters Act, 1964 Business Names Act, 1960 Businesses Act, 1991 Price Control Act, 1964 Sections 2 to 13 and sections 16 to 17 of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1941 Section 54 of the Lotteries Act, 1997, and related regulations.
Clause 26 sets out disclosure requirements that intermediaries who are not regulated under another law have to comply with.
Clause 17 describes circum-stances under which a cancellation penalty may be considered unreasonable.
notice or instructions of safe handling of goods;
In addition, it will allow suppliers to target their marketing to specific population groups to the extent that is reasonable, having regard to the goods and services being offered.
However, the supplier can exceed the original estimate if the consumer in writing declines the estimate or pre-authorises any charges up to a specified maximum.
Thus, depending on the context, a consumer means a person to whom goods or services are marketed in the ordinary course of business; a person who has entered into an agreement or transaction with a supplier;
The Bill applies to goods or services whether promoted by a for profit business, or by a non-profit entity, the State or entities contracted by the State, including Public Private Partnerships.
Suppliers of repair, maintenance or replacement services cannot charge consumers for these services unless the consumer was provided with an estimate which the consumer has authorised.
The Bill regulates loyalty programmes by requiring sponsors of loyalty programmes to meet their obligations when loyalty credits are tendered, prohibits offering inferior quality products or requiring the bundling of reward goods or services with revenue products, requires a supplier to accept the tender of sufficient loyalty credits as adequate consideration for goods and services at any time, subject to limited black-out periods.
In addition, clause 2 specifically provides that in case of a conflict between this Bill and any other law protecting consumers within an industry, the laws are to be enforced concurrently, as far as possible, and beyond that, the law that provides the greater degree of protection for consumers is to prevail.
Clause 82 establishes a scheme for the development through consultation of industry codes of conduct relating to consumer matters, and provides for them to receive the force of law by being prescribed by the Minister.
If a third party has a legal claim over the goods, the supplier is liable to that third party, unless it can be shown that the supplier and consumer colluded to defraud the third party.
Certain agreements or provisions of agreements are listed as unlawful in clause 51, and are void from inception irrespective of the common law or provision of other laws.
Right to disclosure and information
The Bill aims to codify and improve on the common law by addressing unfair contract terms and provide consumers with remedies where there have been breaches of contract.
Clause 63 provides that prepaid certificates, credits and vouchers remain negotiable for up to five years, and that the supplier is obligated to honour them when presented.
Clause 22 outlines the circumstances under which a document would be considered to be in plain language, and the Commission may publish guidelines for methods assessing whether a document satisfies that requirement.
The Bill retains the existing prohibitions against fraudulent schemes and offers, pyramid and related schemes.
The dti believes that large transactions involving large businesses and the State do not require the protection offered by the Bill because they would benefit from the flexibility of operating in an unregulated market. Therefore, the Bill will not apply to transactions when the consumer is the State, or any organ of state;
New provisions in clause 45 aim to ensure fairness in auctions by regulating the participation of owners or their agents as bidders, and requiring notice of any reserve bid or upset price.
Clause 33 establishes standards for the conduct of catalogue sales, clause 34 regulates the use of trade coupons, and clause 37 regulates the marketing of work from home schemes.
The provisions regarding the criteria for, and registration of, business names have been revised, modernised and harmonised with proposals under discussion for criteria applicable to companies in terms of the Companies Act.
To enable consumers to exercise this right the Act provides for consumers to make a formal demand to a marketer to discontinue any such approach to that consumer, and it contemplates the establishment of an Exclusion Register either by industry or by the Commission.
The Bill will apply to most transactions in the ordinary course of business between parties within the Republic, to the promotion of goods and services that could lead to such transactions, and to the goods and services themselves after the transaction is completed.
The Bill further sets out the matters over which provincial consumer protection authorities have jurisdiction in respect of activities occurring or application by per-sons carrying on business exclusively within their provinces, including issuing, on behalf of the Commission, of compliance notices;
Provisions that seek to limit the suppliers liability must be specifically and conspicuously brought to the attention of the consumer, as outlined in clause 49.
or the interaction concerns the supply or potential supply of goods or services to or at the direction of the consumer.
This includes franchise transactions or agreements as described in clause 5.
Clause 14 establishes the consumers right to cancel a fixed-term agreement, limits the rights of suppliers to impose cancellation charges, and sets out rules governing the expiring of such agreements.
It provides that consumers have a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are intended, of good quality, in good working order, free of defects, and useable and durable for a reasonable period of time.
Currently contracts are regulated in terms of the common law.
Any repairs or maintenance cost above the original estimate has to be authorised by the consumer.
Consumers have to be informed and provided with the identity of the agents or person and informed of their right to rescind the agreement during the cooling-off period.
In terms of clause 44, the consumer has the right to assume, and it is an implied term of every transaction, that the supplier or lessor has legal right to sell or lease the goods for full title of the goods to pass to the consumer.
Such a register would allow consumers to pre-emptively block direct marketing approaches.
Clause 9 sets out a small number of well-defined, long-standing and widely accepted commercial practices that allow differential treatment of consumers of a particular sex, age or gender, and states that those practices are not to be construed as unfair discrimination, if the conduct is reasonable.
Accredited consumer protection groups may also enforce consumer rights by commencing or undertaking any lawful act to protect the interests of a consumer individually or a group of consumers collectively in any matter or before any forum contemplated in the Bill;
If two prices are displayed for the same goods, the lowest has to be charged.
a user of the goods or a recipient or beneficiary of the services;
Clause 32 outlines standards to be adhered to when suppliers engage in direct marketing.
In addition to their jurisdiction to hear a matter initiated directly by a consumer, the courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals against Tribunal decisions, and may order suppliers to alter or discontinue certain practices, award damages against suppliers for collective injury to all or a class of consumers, to be paid to any person on any terms that the court might decide.
In addition, there is a general prohibition against consumers being subjected to unfair discrimination when they are entering into a transaction or agreement, and in all aspects of the conduct of the supplier towards the consumer in the course of the transaction.
The Bill identifies the following elements that make a transaction a consumer transaction, and thus bringing it within the scope of the Bill if it is an interaction or agreement to interact between a consumer and supplier in the ordinary course of the suppliers business, including in terms of any public regulation;
If a complaint is made to the Commission, it will investigate, and may make a referral to the Tribunal, which may resolve the matter by making certain orders as contemplated in clause 75.
notice on how to inhibit any risk associated with the use of goods, and to remedy or mitigate the effects, and provide for the safe disposal of the goods.
Under certain circumstances, as described in clause 21, goods or services delivered to or performed for consumers may be regarded as unsolicited, in which case the con-sumer has no obligation to pay for them, and the return of the goods to the supplier is at the suppliers own risk and expense.
The Bill would hold suppliers accountable to consumers for any money or other property belonging to the consumer, but held by the supplier under any agreement, including advance payments for services to be supplied at a later date.
However, this does not apply to used goods or immovable property.
If a complaint arises in an industry in which a statutory ombud scheme is in place, the consumer must pursue a resolution through that scheme before making a complaint to the Commission.
Cause 60 creates a framework for industry codes to be developed, establishing schemes of product safety monitoring and, if needed, product recall.
This Part aims to safeguard the safety of consumers and to establish a regime of product liability, irrespective of negligence on the part of anyone in the supply chain, which currently does not exist in South Africa.
The Commission would have authority to order an investigation and recall of any dangerous or defective products covered by any such industry code.
If a complaint under this Part is directed to the Commission, it will be referred to the equality court.
there is an exchange of consideration;
Right to privacy
The Bill provides for a general right for consumers to receive goods that are of good quality and free from defects, as described in clause 55.
However, an exception is allowed where the consumer has been expressly informed of the condition of the goods and has expressly agreed to buy them in that particular state.
The dti believes that having informed and active consumers will enhance market and price competition.
Any printed information, document or notice that the Bill requires a supplier to pro-duce, provide or deliver to a consumer must satisfy the plain language requirements of clause 22.
The use of a threshold will mean that the protection of the Bill will extend to small shop-keepers and other businesses, when they make routine or minor purchases for the purpose of their business. However, despite those exceptions, clauses 60 and 61, which deal with unsafe goods, will apply to all goods introduced to the market, even if they were the subject of an exempt transaction.
facilitation of settlement of any dispute between the Commission and any provincial consumer protection authority;

achievable recommendations and a proposed implementation plan. 
These hearings will take place 17-21 May 2010 in three provinces. 
Ad Hoc Committee on Service Delivery (CHANGE OF DATE) 
The public hearings at Parliament took place on 2nd  4th February 2010. 
During its visit to the provinces, the Committee will undertake site inspections and meet with members of the communities, local government officials, provincial government department officials, ward committees, civil society organizations, and members of the business fraternity. 
Members of the public are invited to the public hearings that are scheduled to take place in the various provinces as follows: 
The National Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee to conduct coordinated oversight on service delivery under the theme Working together to ensure the delivery of quality service to communities. 
To this end, the Committee undertook coordinated visits in rural and urban areas, and conduct public hearings at Parliament and in the provinces. 
The mandate of the Committee is to enquire into the progress with regard to service delivery and where protests took place what the challenges are in order to table a report to the National Assembly with clear, 
And early the next morning, the young women carried him back down to the well again.
No, they said.
Well lets see if my secret admirer will come and fetch me ? said Sky Maiden when she saw the purse full of money.
Then, when she had read it, What should we do ?
Ive been watching you, Frog said.
What do we do now ? the Sun Chief asked his wife, but the Moon Lady wasnt interested in his problems.
It was at this point, when Kimana was just beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his letter delivered, that Frog approached him.
An Admirer
You may marry my daughter if you come and fetch her, Kimana moaned, reading the Sun Chiefs second letter.
Then you took a purse full of money, which was very brave of you, but I really dont believe you can fetch Sky Maiden, too.
Kimana was a young man in love.
Youll take a purse full of money up to heaven ? said Kimana.
After the Sun Chief had departed, Frog put the letter in his mouth, climbed into an empty jug and waited to be carried back down to Earth.
Rabbit, he asked, would you be so kind as to take this letter to the Sun Chief for me, please ?
So the Sun Chief wrote a reply describing his daughters request then left it on the table next to the water jugs.
Can a frog lead a woman ? she asked.
Dont ask me !
Dear Sun Chief
When the young women werent looking Frog jumped into one of the jugs where he stayed hidden until they climbed back up to heaven.
After giving the matter some thought he decided that the best thing to do was to write a letter to the Sun Chief simply stating his wish.
And Kimana ?
Did you put this letter in my room ? he asked.
Then I brought you a purse full of money.
First I took a letter to Heaven, didnt I ?
Then Ill fetch her for you, said Frog.
You may marry my daughter if you bring me a purse full of money, Kimana read, looking upset.
No, said the girls.
How can this be ?
Are you mad ?
First you took a letter to Heaven.
Then its you that I shall marry, she said, not my secret admirer.
And after that I got you to come down to Earth.
No way !
Well, at least Ill try, he said.
Afterwards, Frog took the letter to Kimana.
Not long afterwards the Sun Chief came into his room for a drink of water, saw the letter then summoned the young women who had been down to the well for him.
Ask your daughter ! she muttered.
What must I do now ? he asked.
The Sky Maiden looked at him.
So the Sun Chief wrote a second letter, which he left on the table, just as before.
Well, hes still looking for a wife, Im afraid.
Impressed, the Sky Maiden thought about this for a moment.
Yes, of course, protested Frog.
HOW FROG WENT TO HEAVEN
So, for the third time Frog climbed back into the well and the next morning the young women came with their jugs and carried him up to heaven, but this time, when he was alone he spat in all the jugs of water - Ptui.
After that, Frog and the Sky Maiden returned to heaven together where they were married and lived happily ever after.
What Kimana didnt know was that Frog lived near a well that the young women who served the Sun Chief visited every day.
Frog, who was a frog of few words, merely shrugged.
Again, Kimana thought about Frogs offer.
Ask your daughter ! snapped Moon Lady.
How Frog went to Heaven
In the end, Kimana turned to his friend Rabbit for help.
What ?
So he went to his wife again.
However, the Sky Maiden was the daughter of the Sun Chief, who was a very powerful and important person and for this reason Kimana wasnt quite sure how to proceed with his courtship.
In heaven, the young women placed the water jugs in the Sun Chiefs room then left.
No, Im afraid thats not possible.
Kimana looked at Frog for a moment then he shrugged.
Then he went to Hawk who offered to take it half way, but no further, which wasnt really much help, of course.
Read this, he said, handing her the letter.
Take it to heaven ?
Now he has sent an evil spirit in the shape of a frog and this is the cause of all the sickness.
The next morning Frog hid in the well again, only this time instead of having a letter in his mouth, he had a purse full of money.
Did you bring me this purse full of money today ? he asked them.
Again, Frog put the letter in his mouth and climbed into an empty jug.
Well, what have I got to lose ? he said finally, handing over the letter.
Then he went to see the young women who had been down to Earth to fetch water for him.
OK, he said finally, reaching under his jacket.
OK, then Ill take it for you, said Frog.
Take your letter to heaven ? he said.
Rabbit stared at him like he had gone off his head.
I cant go and fetch her.
But Kimana shook his head.
Exactly the same thing happened : the young women who served the Sun Chief climbed down from heaven singing their song and when they lowered their water jugs into the well, Frog jumped into one.
Please take it to heaven for me.
Well, at least Ill try, answered Frog.
And so the next day, the Sky Maiden went down to the well with the serving girls, but she stayed behind when all the other young women returned to heaven.
Angola, which is roughly the same size as South Africa but has only about one-quarter the population, is situated to the north of Botswana and Namibia.
I am human and live on Earth and I want to marry your daughter, Sky Maiden.
The next morning, the same young women collected the water jugs - including the one containing Frog - and climbed down to Earth, singing their song as they went Good day to you, my sister.
And, just as before, Frog ended up in the Sun Chiefs room, where he spat out the purse full of money and then hid in a corner.
Why dont you take the letter yourself ?
And when Frog was quite certain that he was alone he jumped out of the jug, spit the letter onto the table and hid in a corner.
They all shook their heads.
I cant do that, he said, shaking his head.
He was in love with the Sky Maiden, whom he wanted to marry.
So he next went to Antelope who also refused to deliver the letter.
When the people of the house drank the water from the well they all became so sick the Sun Chief had to summon a spirit doctor who first examined all the evidence then said, You promised your daughter to a man of Earth, but she has not gone.
Kimana looked at him in amazement.
Ask your daughter ! said Moon Lady, irritably waving him away with her hand.
Ptui  before hiding in a corner of the room again.
Having finished his letter, Kimana then had to get it delivered, which was easier said than done because the Sun Chief and his daughter both lived in heaven.
She had only been waiting a few moments when Frog climbed out of the well and sat in front of her.
Whatever I was asked to do, I did.
I will go down to Earth, the Sky Maiden said when her father told her what the spirit doctor had said.
Lets ask the writer to bring me a wedding gift, said Sky Maiden a short while later after she too had read the letter.
When they lowered their jugs into the well to refill them, Frog jumped out.
Just after daybreak the young women climbed down out of the sky and visited the well singing the song they always sang when they collected water - Good day to you, my sister.
He only climbed out of the well when the young women had gone back to heaven.
Luanda, the capital, is a large sea port on the Atlantic coast.
Good day to you  after which they lowered their jugs into the water.
What cant you do ? asked Frog.
I cant take a purse full of money up to heaven, thats what.
When the Sun Chief found the purse shortly afterwards, he muttered.
Yes, but I can, said Frog.
The Sun Chief then went to speak to his wife, Moon Lady.
This story comes from Angola.
I cant do that ! he confessed a moment later.
Oh, said Kimana quite taken aback by Rabbits reaction.
So, early the next morning Frog put Kimanas letter in his mouth and hid in the well.
Cant do what ? asked Frog.
Shall I lead you to your husband-to-be ? he asked.
Good day to you.
Heres a purse full of money.
Each morning these young women would climb down from the sky on a ladder made by spider and fill up their water jugs before returning to heaven again.
Thats a difficult name to remember, he said.
Well, said Ananse with a smile, when the drummers beat the small drum it will make a sound like Firi bomo !
Afterwards Ananse realised how foolish he had been.
Its called Pona, said Night.
When Ananse got to Nights village he said to Night, Your father wants to see you.
Then it seemed a thought struck him.
And you, Moon, he said turning to his second son, you have also forgotten the things I told you.
I have completed my task, master, said Ananse bowing low to the Sky God.
Was Sun a wise choice, he wondered ?
How do I choose ? the Sky God muttered.
How will that help ? asked Sun, confused.
Its called Asante, father, answered Moon.
Thank you, said Ananse, impressed.
This was because Sun was the Sky Gods favourite son, but just because he was his favourite did this also mean he should be chief ?
Ananse gave the matter a lot of thought and in the end decided to disguise himself as a bird and do a bit of spying before carrying out his masters instruction.
While they were growing up Night, Moon and Sun lived with their father, but when it came time for him to select one of them as chief he sent them to live in their own villages so that he could make his decision without too many distractions.
Now I must go and deliver the same message to your two brothers, said Ananse.
At this remark Sun pulled a face.
Who do I choose ?
Ananse reasoned that there was only one way out of the predicament he had created for himself : in order to keep himself in the Sky Gods good books he needed to convince his master that he actually could tell what he was thinking.
The capital of Ghana is Accra.
Thats a good plan, he said.
A yam, by the way, looks rather like a potato.
HOW SPIDER READ THE SKY-GODS THOUGHTS
Do you know what the question is ? asked Sun.
I know what youre thinking. Do you ? said the Sky God, but instead of carrying on the conversation as spider had expected him to do, he changed the subject.
At Suns village, Ananse said, Your father says you must come along with me. Then Ill set out straight away, but first let me get you something to eat.
For this reason, I have decided that only children will play during your reign.
Sun then went and slaughtered a sheep, which he roasted in honour of his small guest.
Yes, I do : he will ask you to name his favourite yam, which is called Kintinkyi.
Then turning back to his sons once more, Sun, if Moon tries to trespass upon your time Kontonkurowie, which is the circular rainbow, will throw itself around you and this will keep Moon away.
Now, throughout this ceremony the drums were beating. There were small drums and Inpintini drums and the sound they made was Kintinkyi bomo !
After the meal Ananse said, Lets go and sit on that fallen tree over there, I have something to tell you.
The Sky God had three sons  Night, Moon, and Sun.
When the locals saw this strange new bird they all became excited.
Then, edging closer, Ananse began to whisper.
Your three sons are here as you ordered.
But this was easier said than done.
And when they were seated together, Your father has prepared a throne for the son he will name as chief and he wants you to be that person.
Night, he said, you are my eldest son. What is the name of this yam ?
Sun, you listened to my words and you did not forget them;
However, he will also ask you and your two brothers the same question, and the one who answers the question correctly will be named as chief.
Night, he said, addressing himself to his eldest son, I also took you on walks, but you have allowed yourself to forget the things I told you, including the name of this yam.
you listened to my advice, so you are to be the chief.
But there is one question that I need each one of you to answer before I make my final decision.
Yes, I know it is, but I can help you with that.
Sun nodded.
The fact was he didnt know what the Sky God had been thinking and had merely spoken out in the hope of attracting his masters attention.
Oh, and one more thing, he said smiling down at spider, In the past my decrees were called The sayings of the Sky-God, but now, since Ananse, the spider, has been able to read my mind, they should be called The Sayings of Spider.
During this period, he remained in his palace where he would sit deep in thought on his throne, a fire-blackened stool, trying to arrive at a verdict.
I know, he said, suddenly smiling to himself, I will pull up a yam known as Kintinkyi, which I used to show to my sons when they were young.
This was a difficult question for the Sky God to answer and one which he thought about all the time.
Thank you, said the Sky God, then raising his voice so everyone could hear, My sons, the reason I have brought you here is because I now wish to choose a chief.
It is called Kintinkyi.
Look, this is what Im going to do.
Ill make a small drum for you, and Ill also make an Inpintini drum to go with it.
The following story comes from Ghana, which is a west-African country situated between Ivory Coast and Togo.
And if rain clouds gather, I shall shoot an arrow into the sky to drive them away.
Because of this, it is now law that only wicked things will be done during your time of day.
What kind of bird is that ? the Sky God asked those around him, but no one knew.
Turning to his second son, the Sky God said, What do you think is the name of this yam, Moon ?
Ananse edged closer so that he could hear what he was saying.
He was just about to fly away again when he realised that the Sky God was still talking to himself.
Sun stepped forward and took the yam from his fathers hand.
Now youve read the story, do you think this was a good way for the Sky God to choose a new chief ? And what about Sun  was he fair to his two brothers ?
Some of those present looked confused and the rest just shrugged uncomfortably, but no one spoke.
Ananse had overheard all of this so now he really did know what the Sky God was thinking : he wanted to name his favourite son, Sun, as chief, but only if Sun could remember the name of the special yam he had been shown as a child.
You used to take me for walks when I was very small and you used to tell me its name, and I have not forgotten it.
At this reply those present shouted and applauded.
If Ananse were here, he would know the birds name, he said loudly. Then he sighed and said much more quietly to himself, He would also know that I want to make Sun chief, but I cant make up my mind if this is the right decision.
I remember this, he said.
I would have liked my father to be here so that I could prepare a meal for him also, Sun confessed, and Im sorry that he isnt, but youre here as his representative so I shall show you all the honour and respect I would have shown him.
How Spider Read the Sky-Gods Thoughts
And when they beat the lnpintini drum at the same time it will sound like this.
Kintinkyi bomo !, which is the word you have to remember, right ? and spider made the sound of the drum with his mouth, Kintinkyi bomo !
What he needed was a plan.
He has asked me to bring you to him.
At Moons village the same thing happened : Ananse delivered the Sky Gods message and Moon thanked him by giving him some mashed yam to eat.
Thank you for delivering the message, said Night.
A day later Sun, Moon and Night gathered in their fathers village.
Then at least let me give you something to eat for your journey, said Night and brought out some roasted corn which he gave to Ananse.
If one of them is able to remember its name then that son shall become chief.
Ananse, he said, please go and bring my three sons to me.
Some of them started shouting and pointing and everyone made such a commotion they soon attracted the attention of the Sky God himself.
Ah ! thought Ananse, so that was what my master was thinking !
Should any one have a matter to settle, let it be heard in Suns time.
Then the Sky God rose to his feet and everyone fell silent.
Then, just as the Sky God was about to turn away again, Ananse the spider said, I do, master.
Kintinkyi bomo ! just as spider said they would.
Then, happily, he turned to his youngest son.
Thats why, one day, he suddenly looked around at his attendants and asked, Can anyone tell me what I am thinking ?
It grows under the ground too, but only in tropical countries.
At this point he held up a Kintinkyi yam that he had dug up that morning.
He was also worried that his subjects would realise that he wasnt giving his full attention to the affairs of state.
So, he took some flower petals that resembled bird feathers and stuck them onto his body. Then, with his bird costume in place, he flew to the Sky Gods village, where he perched himself in the branches of a tree in the centre of the main square.
In other words, in speaking out, he had dug a very large hole for himself and now there was a very good chance he was about to fall in !
Will you do that ?
Then seeing the look of confusion on the others face, You know what this is, dont you ?
Yes.
Yes, my lord, it woke me up with its loud calls.
Then he led the sun inside his palace.
And so every morning when the cockerel crows the sun knows that it is time to wake up and hurry to the Sky Gods home in the sky.
Oh, and by the way, added the Sky God, come back to see me in the morning.
Yes, I will, my lord.
I have a present for you, he said, holding it out to the sun.
Here take it, the Sky God said, thrusting the large white bird in the suns golden arms.
Then after you have visited my house you can slowly go back to your own.
You can go now.
Its my pleasure to be here, sir, said the sun very graciously.
Well.thank you, my lord, said the sun hesitantly because he was still rather puzzled.
I hope your journey wasnt too tiring because I know it was very difficult.
According to most scientists our universe began with a big bang about 10 billion years ago.
However, it took the sun a long time to steer a path through all the stars because they had not yet been given their positions in the sky, which meant that finding a way amongst them was quite difficult.
Yes, my lord, of course I will, he answered.
In fact I want you to do that every morning.
After the sun had departed for his place in the sky, the Sky God then called the moon to his house.
However, in this story from Angola a different explanation about how the world began is suggested.
And so the sun walked away carrying a large cockerel under his arm.
Yes, my lord, of course I do, its a cockerel.
I heard your cockerel crow, said the Sky God.
How the World Began
Eventually, however, the sun arrived at the Sky Gods house.
Thank you for doing that.
This wasnt what the sun had expected, but the Sky God was his lord and master, so what choice did he have ?
Of course, the sun was very tired after his long journey across the heavens and he was also very hungry.
Good morning, my lord, the sun said respectfully, I am here as you asked.
Im pleased to hear that, said the Sky God then he reached behind him and pulled out a live cockerel.
In fact, he thought of eating the cockerel but then decided against the idea.
Early the next morning the sun was woken up by the loud cock-a-doodle-do of the cockerel and he hurried off to see the Sky God.
Good.
In the end, the sun was so exhausted he just lay down on the soft grass outside the Sky Gods house and was soon fast asleep.
HOW THE WORLD BEGAN
It was while this was happening that all the stars and planets were formed.
Welcome to my house, he said sitting down on his throne.
After all, the bird had been to given him by the Sky God, so eating it just didnt seem like the right thing to do.
Yes, thank you for coming, replied the Sky God.
After he had thought about this problem for a long time he asked the sun to come and visit him.
From now on you must let the cockerel wake you up in the morning then you must come straight to my house here in the sky.
When the great Sky God decided to create the world he also had to decide where in the heavens to put the sun and moon.
Then I rushed here to see you as you asked.
A long, long time ago, millions of years before the Earth existed, the sky looked very different to what it does today.
I see you decided not to eat the cockerel that I gave you, even though you were tired and hungry, said the Sky God.
Of course not, my lord.
Good evening, moon, said the Sky God, then getting straight down to business, here is a cockerel for you.
Thank you, my lord, said the moon bowing very deeply.
Thank you, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
The bird was a gift from you.
Please come and see me tomorrow morning.
The moon was rather surprised by the Sky Gods behaviour and even more surprised when she was given a live cockerel to hold.
Then, carrying the cockerel under her arm, she went off to find a place to sleep.
At this remark the Sky God looked very pleased.
But I will ask you to come to see me every twenty-eight days and while youre away, Ill keep my eye on you in the sky.
Like the sun, the moon also had a long walk among the stars to reach the Sky Gods house.
I would never eat it.
Early the next morning the cockerel woke the moon with its loud crowing and the moon went to see the Sky God again.
Still, she reasoned, the Sky God had made the universe, so he must know what he was doing.
In fact, the journey took so long it was night time when moon finally knocked on the Sky Gods door.
And with these words the Sky God bid the moon goodbye and sent her back to her allotted place in the sky.
Since that time the sun and the moon have obeyed the Sky Gods wishes.
It was a long journey.
Well, here is a cockerel, said the Sky God.
After the Sky God had placed the sun and the moon in their positions in the sky he then turned his attention to another important matter : creating Man. For many, many years after man was created he lived quietly in Africas forests then one day he also decided to visit the Sky God in his palace.
Anyway, Man eventually arrived at the Sky Gods house and knocked on the front door.
Every morning, the sun wakes up when the cockerel crows then immediately goes to visit the sky God at his house.
Oh, I am, my lord, replied Man, very tired.
Ah, Man. Youve finally got here, said the Sky God.
And every twenty-eight days, when the moon is full, she does the same thing.
Like the sun, the moon also had a long walk among the stars to reach the Sky Gods house.
In fact, he would never have got there without some magical help from the Sky God himself, but thats another story.
You must be tired.
As you can imagine, it took Man a long time to get to the Sky Gods house.
He lit a fire, cooked the bird over the open flames then sat down to enjoy his supper.
Yes, Im afraid it is.
Please take it with you and come and see me again tomorrow morning.
But he was so worn out he only managed to eat half the bird before he fell into a deep sleep.
Thank you, my lord, said Man gratefully accepting the bird.
Thats very kind of you, my lord.
The Man was tired and hungry just like the sun and the moon had been, but unlike them he decided to eat the cockerel.
You obviously slept through the cock crow this morning.
That was when Man suddenly realised that he had done something wrong.
I was so hungry last night I killed and ate the cockerel you gave me.
Oh, Id better rush off and see the Sky God, Man said, leaping to his feet and rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Is it that late already, my lord ? asked Man.
Its a gift from me.
Like the sun, the moon also had a long walk among the stars to reach the Sky Gods house.
The Sky God met him at the door to his palace.
Good morning, or should I say good afternoon ? he joked.
After a long pause he said nervously, I have something I must tell you, my lord.
In fact, he was so exhausted he slept for a long, long time and only woke up when the sun was already high in the sky.
No, you will die like the cockerel did.
I gave the sun and the moon a cockerel each, but they didnt eat their birds even though they were just as hungry as you.
By now the Man was so scared his mouth had gone dry.
Now leave me and go away, said the Sky God.
Why did you do that ?
Because you killed and ate the cockerel I gave you, you will not live forever in the sky like the sun and the moon.
And so it came to pass that all of the humans who were born after that first man, had to live out their lives on Earth and only visited the Sky God in his house after they died.
I didnt know I was doing anything wrong, my lord, he whispered fearfully.
With his mind still mixed up, the Man began his long journey back down to
Like the sun, the moon also had a long walk among the stars to reach the Sky Gods house.
The Sky God glared at him.
The Man didnt know what to think because he wasnt sure if the Sky Gods ruling was a good or a bad thing for him.
You mean to your house in the sky, my lord ?
This explains why the moon and the sun journey across the sky in the way they do and why humans remain on Earth for their entire lives.
Because I was hungry, my lord.
There is a lesson contained in this story, too;
every choice that you make will always affect your life in some way and often in a manner that you least expect at the time.
The Sky God shook his head.
But when you die - and only then - you will come here once more.
From now on the sun and moon will live in the sky forever and they will never die because they have their cockerels to wake them up every morning, but things will be different for you, he said.

The NCOP gives voice to the perspectives of the nine provinces of South Africa and also provides a platform for local government to participate in legislative deliberations at a national level. 
a Chairperson, and 
The NCOP also ensures that local government concerns are represented at the highest level. 
Each provincial delegation has ten members made up of: 
the National Council of Provinces, which has at least 90 delegates. 
The NCOP consists of nine provincial delegations nominated by the provincial legislatures, and the delegation of the South African Local Government Association. 
Most of this legislative work is done in committees, but all Bills must be referred to a sitting of the NCOP for debate and for a vote on whether to accept or reject the Bill. 
The NCOP considers, passes, amends, proposes amendments to, or rejects legislation 
These officers manage the work of the NCOP and preside over debates, making sure that delegates can speak freely while remaining within the House rules. 
If necessary, the Premier can appoint someone to take her/his place. 
The Composition of the NCOP 
The NCOP elects Presiding Officers from amongst its members; 
It must consider all national Bills. 
The Constitution says the NCOP represents the provinces to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government. 
NCOP Office bearers 
Lawmaking role 
Parliament of South Africa

as well as being the focal point for the articulation of local government and provincial concerns at national level. 
The National Council of Provinces 
Parliament consists of two houses 
It may also initiate or prepare Bills falling within Schedule 4 of the Constitution and certain bills affecting the provinces. 
The delegation is headed by the Premier of each province, who is one of the special delegates. 
The permanent Deputy Chairperson is elected for five years while provincial Premiers take turns to be rotating Deputy Chairpersons for a year. 
The role of the NCOP 
SALGA delegation is chosen by its executive committee from a group of representatives of the Local Government Associations in the nine provinces. 
the National Assembly, which has 400 members, and 
It does this mainly by participating in the national legislative process, and by providing a national forum for public debate of important issues affecting the provinces. 
The NCOP is envisaged as a body to achieve cooperative governance and participatory democracy, 
six permanent delegates 
Bills which do not affect provinces: 
It has a constitutional legislative role to deal with three kinds of Bills: 
If there is disagreement between the NA and the NCOP about a Bill affecting provinces, the Bill must be sent to the Mediation Committee. 
If the Bill to amend the constitution does not directly affect provinces, the constitution requires the NCOP to debate the Bill before it goes to the NA for voting. 
Oversight is a constitutionally mandated function of Parliament to check and monitor government actions. 
Bills that directly affect provinces: 
When voting for these Bills in the NCOP, each province has one vote. 
Most of these Bills can be introduced in the NCOP by either House; but there are some Bills that have to start in the National Assembly. 
If the NCOP wants to make changes to the Bill, it goes back to the National Assembly, which can accept or reject the changes. 
Bills that do not affect provinces are those which relate to national functions; such as defence, foreign affairs, and justice. 
When a Bill to amend or change the constitution directly affects the provinces, at least six of the nine provinces in the NCOP must agree to it. 
Oversight role 
Examples of Bills affecting provinces include education, transport, welfare, and health. 
When such Bills have been passed by the National Assembly, they go to the NCOP for voting. 
Bills that amend the Constitution: 
By making a submission, you have an opportunity to influence the opinion of members of a committee who are discussing and debating a particular piece of legislation before it is finalised. 
These are some of the ways that can be used: 
Contact a Member of Parliament 
The right to petition Parliament is the right of every citizen of the country and is provided for in our Constitution. 
The NCOP exercises oversight over the national aspects of provincial and local government. 
Make a Submission 
Once a bill has been debated by a committee, it is submitted to the NCOP for a vote. 
A submission to a committee of Parliament is one way of making your voice heard in Parliament. 
The NCOP also conducts oversight visits to the communities in order to ensure that they get direct information on the needs and challenges of the people. 
The NCOP's committees are called Select Committees, for example, the Select Committee on Housing, Public Works and Transport. 
The Committee also debates and amends Bills, and organises public hearings if an issue is of great public interest. 
A petition is a way of bringing a grievance or an issue of public concern to the attention of Parliament to take action within its authority. 
Petition: 
The NCOP delegates may ask Cabinet ministers questions which must be answered in the NCOP. 
Members of public can contact MPs in constituency offices throughout the country or at Parliament if you want to win their support for an issue you feel strongly about or if you need assistance with a particular problem. 
Each provincial delegation has one vote that is cast on behalf of the province by the head of its delegation. 
NCOP Committees 
Any person, groups of people or an organisation has the right to petition Parliament. 
The NCOP may require a Cabinet member, an official in the national government or a provincial government to attend a meeting of the Council or a committee of the Council. 
Each Committee shadows the work of specific government departments. 
The NCOP or any of its committees may receive petitions, representations or submissions from any interested persons or institutions. 
Role of the Members of the Public on Oversight 
Committees may summon any person to give evidence or to produce documents, and they may require any person or institution to report to them. 
Members of the public can make a meaningful contribution on oversight to ensure that the government is answerable to the needs of the people.

TYPES OF PETITIONS 
PETITIONS 
Public participation is an important cornerstone of our burgeoning democracy; one way of ensuring that Government accounts to the people for its actions. 
Only a Member of Parliament can formally present a petition for consideration in Parliament. 
PRESENTATION OF A PETITION 
PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Be in a form prescribed by the Speaker of the National Assembly orthe Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; 
Petitions are classified into two categories, namely special petitions and public or general petitions. 
Clearly explain the issues or circumstances for Parliament's consideration; and 
Parliament has developed a number of mechanisms to promote public involvement in the law-making process and broaden access to a people's Parliament. 
It is the inherent right of the members of the public in a democratic society to prepare and present petitions as and when the need arises. 
However, there are certain procedures to be followed by individuals and/or groups in processing their petitions. 
One way the public can exercise this Constitutional right is through petitioning. 
Members of the public may contact a Member of Parliament to express a view on a piece of legislation. 
Despite women constituting the majority of the South African population, women are still in the minority when it comes to decision making. 
Women's representation in the National Assembly has increased to 45. 
such as the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Platform of Action, which was established by the Beijing Conference on Women. 
Tel: 403 3840 
The Bill of Rights guarantees equal treatment for all South Africans. 
Women should participate in lawmaking because the implementation of legislation and government policies has an impact on their daily lives. 
In order for women to fully participate in lawmaking, women's access to basic services should be improved. 
The South African Constitution provides a framework for the promotion of gender equality, and therefore the participation of women in lawmaking. 
WHAT ARE THE KEY STRUCTURES FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN 
Women make up a substantial proportion of voters and can exercise the right to vote in order to influence how Parliament is made up, and how the institution prioritises the development of women. 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN LAWMAKING? 
In addition to the provisions made in the Constitution, South Africa has committed to gender equality through its ratification of international conventions 
South Africa is part of several African programmes of action and the advancement of women, e.g. 
Women are traditionally the poorest group in South Africa and more likely to be underemployed or unemployed. 
The fourth Parliament has established the following Committees that deal directly with issues relating to women: 
the Southern African Development Community protocol on gender and development.

They can also become involved in organising and working for their chosen party and being elected into its structures. 
PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN? 
A new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities has also been created to consolidate the government's activities in developing and protecting vulnerable people in our society. 
If an issue is of great public interest, a Committee in the National Assembly or the National Council of Provinces may decide to hold public hearings or call for submissions. 
Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities 
It prohibits unfair discrimination on the basis of race, gender or sex. 
WHAT ARE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ENABLING THE 
Violence against women remains one of the biggest challenges facing South Africa. 
Women have risen to top positions in this way. 
Poverty is a struggle faced by many South African women, especially rural women. 
There are many challenges that prevent women from playing a full and meaningful role, and the biggest one is poverty. 
These include, among others, the Commission on Gender Equality and the South African Human Rights Commission. 
South Africa has also adopted legislation to specifically address gender equality. 
Telephone: 403 3341 
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FACING WOMEN IN PARTICIPATING IN 
The national election gives all people over the age of 18 the right to vote for the party of their choice. 
Poor women have inadequate access to institutions that make laws. 
Furthermore, HIV/ AIDS affects a far greater proportion of women, especially young women in their childbearing years. 
The Constitution makes provision for institutions that support democracy, as well as for the participation of women. 
South Africa ranks third in the world in terms of representation of women in Parliament. 
There are different ways in which this can be done.

IMPORTANT CONTACT INFORMATION 
HOW WELL ARE WOMEN CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT? 
No society can be truly emancipated until its women and men are free and equal, and to this end, men and women bear a shared responsibility. 
LAWMAKING? 
INSPIRED BY PEOPLE 
Our growing democracy has improved women's access to political power and decision-making. 
HOW CAN WOMEN PARTICIPATE IN LAWMAKING? 
Men and women have an equal and significant role to play in the transformation of gender relations in society. 
Select Committee on Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities 
WOMEN AND PARLIAMENT 
The Bill of Rights emphasises that measures must be taken to promote the achievement of equality in all spheres of society. 
More importantly, research has shown that when women take part in decision making, it leads to an increased focus and allocation of resources that improve the quality of life of all. 
Women can participate in lawmaking by voting for the political party they think can best represent their views and concerns in Parliament. 
1 An increase in the participation of women in lawmaking can by extension lead to an improvement in access to basic services such as housing, education and welfare. 
Women constitute more than half of the South African population and therefore the voices of women must be included when decisions are taken and laws are made. 
Access to basic services such as education, water and welfare has been influenced by unequal gender, race and class relations. 
How people vote in the elections determines the composition of both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. 
Produced by Parliamentary Communication Services 
The challenge is to make the rights accessible to all women. 
The South African Constitution says that there must be public access to and involvement in Parliament and its processes.

the establishment of a National Expropriation Advisory Board to advise the Minister and of Regional Expropriation Advisory Boards to advise all expropriating authorities on all aspects of expropriation, including the determination of compensation.
The redrafting of the Act therefore became necessary to ensure consistency with the spirit and provisions of the Constitution dealing especially with equality, property rights, access to information, and lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair administrative decision-making. Given the array of authorities within the national, provincial and municipal spheres of government who have the power to expropriate property, there is a need to ensure uniformity in the way organs of state undertake expropriation.

In particular, a year is allowed from the time the Bill is signed and promulgated before the provisions establishing the new Commission will take effect.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE
The State Law Advisers and the Department of Trade and Industry are of the opinion that the Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure prescribed by section 76 or of the Constitution since it falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 to the Constitution, namely consumer protection.
OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND BODIES CONSULTED
It is proposed that it be converted into a statutory body. The agency will require a staff complement of 94 people, 31 of whom will be transferred from the Consumer and Corporate Regulation Division. Therefore 63 positions will have to be filled in future.
Recognising the extensive scope of this Bill on the consumer economy, and the difficulty of accurately predicting all of the particular administrative changes needed to accommodate it, the transition rules create fl exibility by permitting the Minister to defer, for up to a further six months, the effect of any specific provision, if more time proves to be required to prepare for the efficient and effective implementation of the provision.
The Bill requires the Commission to promote and support the development of a fair, transparent, sustainable, responsible, efficient, effective and accessible consumer market and industry, particularly to serve the needs of historically disadvantaged persons, low-income persons and communities, and remote, isolated or low-density areas and communities;
A further six months is provided for before the remaining provisions will take effect and the old laws will be repealed.

CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS
MANAGED INCREMENTAL INTRODUCTION OF NEW LAW
The Tribunal established under the National Credit Act, 2005, will conduct hearings on complaints under the Act and adjudicate certain disputes and alleged prohibited conduct under the Act.
The Commission is not a completely new institution, as it will entail the expansion of the mandate of the Office of Consumer Protection, which is currently being incubated within the dti.
The Bill was published in the Gazette for public comment, and further consultations were held with other government departments, sector regulators, industry associations, consumer groups, professional associations, trade unions and other interested persons.
Given the fact that the national and provincial governments have concurrent legislative competence in respect of consumer protection, initial consultation was conducted with provinces to ensure that there was broad agreement on the Bill and that potential constitutional concerns have been dealt with.

SA Law Commission
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE
SUMMARY OF BILL
The Bill encourages disputants to seek resolution of their disputes through mediation, conciliation and arbitration in their provincial consumer courts, ombuds or other such agencies.
It is an offence to fail to comply with a compliance order.
Item 2 of the second Schedule, which deals with transitional arrangements, provides a schedule to manage the coming into operation of the Act, so as to afford reasonable time for both suppliers and the regulators to adjust their practices and systems to accommodate the new requirements of the Act.
refer matters relating to alleged offences in terms of the Act to the National Prosecuting Authority.
The State Law Advisers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18 of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003, since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional communities.
Criminal sanc-tions relate to offences and administrative sanctions relate to prohibited conduct.
INDUSTRY REGULATION
The decisions of the Tribunal can be appealed against or reviewed by the High Court.
It is envisaged that an amount of R51,3 million for the 2009/10 financial year will need to be budgeted for.
and referral of unresolved disputes to provincial consumer courts.
and investigate and evaluate alleged prohibited conduct and enforce compliance with the Act.
refer matters relating to alleged prohibited conduct in terms of the Act to the Tribunal.
ENFORCEMENT OF ACT
Finally, recognising that some municipalities may face resource and capacity impediments that could inhibit their ability to address their new obligations as suppliers of goods or services to consumers, the transitional provisions grant the Minister authority, on request by the Minister for Provincial and Local Government, to further defer the application of specific provisions of the Bill to those municipalities as may prove necessary.
The Bill proposes the establishment of the Commission, which, together with the Tribunal, will provide for the effective administration of the Act.
The provincial consumer protection authorities may also request the Commission to initiate a complaint in respect of any apparent prohibited conduct or offence in terms of the Act.
The Bill makes provision for criminal and administrative sanctions.
Department of Social Development
REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS
The Bill gives the Commission power to issue a compliance notice to a person or association of persons whom the Commission on reasonable grounds believes has engaged in prohibited conduct.
conduct research and make proposals for reform to improve access to the consumer market or generally to achieve the objectives of the Act;
The following departments were consulted on the Bill :
Department of Transport
Department of Housing
The Commission will be established as an organ of state responsible to the Minister.
All provincial departments of finance and economic affairs
The Bill particularly proposes that the Chief Justice shall appoint a panel of judges with relevant expertise to adjudicate on disputes emanating from expropriations;
Given the array of authorities within the national, provincial and municipal spheres of government who have the power to expropriate property, there is a need to ensure uniformity in the way organs of state undertake expropriation.
In the subsequent drafting of the Bill, the Department specifically liaised with the Department of Land Affairs and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE
? ? the market value of the property;
and ? ? the purpose of the expropriation;
The expropriating authority must give consideration to all submissions and must attempt to reach an agreement with persons whose rights and interests may be adversely affected, before deciding to expropriate;
In terms of the Act only the holders of registered rights and certain unregistered rights are eligible for compensation upon expropriation.
expropriating authorities and affected parties to exchange technical reports and other relevant information, in endeavouring to reach agreement on compensation.
In November 2007, the Department of Public Works published a Draft Policy on the Expropriation Bill for public comment and in February 2008, the Department hosted workshops on the policy with organs of state and the private sector, respectively.
In the absence of agreement, the expropriating authority shall make a determination on compensation.
The State Law Advisers and the Department of Public Works are of the opinion that this Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure established by section of the Constitution since it contains no provision to which the procedure set out in section 74 or 76 of the Constitution applies.
and the repeal of the Act and the Land Affairs Act, 1987. The current Land Affairs Board will, however, continue to discharge its duties until such time as the National Expropriation Advisory Board has been established.
The Boards will also render advice to organs of state on the fair value of immovable property when the State acquires property other than through expropriation, or disposes thereof.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE
It would thus be unconstitutional to terminate unregistered rights without compensation;
Should any party not accept the ruling of the court, that party would have the right to appeal;
all affected parties to be notified of a contemplated expropriation, to afford such parties an opportunity to raise objections and make representations to the expropriating authority, before a decision to expropriate is taken.
Printed by Creda Communications
The Bill seeks to align the Act with the Constitution and to provide a common framework to guide the processes and procedures for expropriation of property by organs of state, by providing for the extension of the purposes for which property may be expropriated from the narrow term of public purpose to include expropriations in the public interest.
? ? the extent of direct state investment and subsidy in the acquisition and beneficial capital improvement of the property;
the payment of just and equitable compensation to persons affected by expropriations, with such compensation reflecting an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected.
the establishment and maintenance of a register of all expropriations by the Department of Public Works.
In the event that the expropriated owner or holder of a right does not accept such determination, he or she may approach the court for a review of the process.
the establishment of a National Expropriation Advisory Board to advise the Minister and of Regional Expropriation Advisory Boards to advise all expropriating authorities on all aspects of expropriation, including the determination of compensation.
an expropriating authority to depart from the prescribed procedures where it is reasonable and justifiable to do so, for instance, when an expropriation has to be effected as a matter of urgency;
Whilst the market value of expropriated property is a predominant factor in the Act, the Constitution does not give undue weight to any single factor over others, but requires consideration of all relevant factors, including ? ? the current use of the property;
the staffing of the Secretariat to the Boards by officials from the Department of PublicWorks, who shall be responsible for the provision of support functions;
The Expropriation Act, 1975, predates the Constitution, which provides that any law or conduct inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid and any obligation imposed by the Constitution must be fulfilled.
Although expropriation is a drastic measure of acquisition of anothers property, it is recognised as an essential mechanism for the State in certain instances and is thus protected by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.
BACKGROUND
MEMORANDUM ON THE OBJECTS OF THE EXPROPRIATION BILL, 2008
the expansion of the scope of protected rights to provide for compensation for both registered and unregistered rights.
? ? the history of the acquisition and use of the property;
The redrafting of the Act therefore became necessary to ensure consistency with the spirit and provisions of the Constitution dealing especially with equality, property rights, access to information, and lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair administrative decision-making.
The State Law Advisers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18 of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003, since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional communities.
The implementation of the Bill will have financial implications for the Department of Public Works, in that it will be responsible for the establishment of the Expropriation Advisory Boards and their secretariats, as well as a register of expropriations.
Expropriation in the public interest, for instance, provides government with a tool to achieve its commitment to land reform, and to reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africas natural resources;
all disputes emanating from expropriations to be dealt with in a High Court, albeit with special institutional measures.
Section 25 of the Constitution, however, does not distinguish between registered rights and unregistered rights.
the withdrawal of an expropriation of property if the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest or otherwise expedient to do so;
The Bill proposes that the Minister be empowered to establish those Boards for different geographical areas in order to ensure effective and efficient services to all expropriating authorities and organs of state;
all existing laws dealing with expropriation to continue to apply, to the extent that they are consistent with the provisions of the Bill and the Constitution. The Bill proposes that no property may be expropriated unless the procedures prescribed in the Bill have been followed;
All expropriating authorities will therefore be obliged to provide the Department with copies of all notices of contemplated expropriation, expropriation and withdrawal of expropriation, as well as decisions not to proceed with contemplated expropriations;
Copies of the Bill may be obtained from and enquiries can also be directed to Ms Pat Jayiya, tel 403-3661, fax 403-2808 or e-mail : pjayiya@parliament.gov.za

So with his new plan all worked out, mantis took his djani up into the tallest baobab and waited quietly amongst the branches.
On the day that the mantis decided to put his plan into action he hid himself in a bush until the sky began to darken.
He must be a god so we must bow down and praise him.
THE MANTIS AND THE MOON
And while it was trying to free itself the mantis would scramble up the stake and climb onto the moon, which he would then ride victoriously across the sky.
Now Ive caught you !
In the days that followed this first attempt, the mantis went back to observing the moon.
Ill have one more try, he said, then closed his eyes for a moment, preparing for an even greater leap.
Angrily picking up a stone he hurled it into the pool.
No, not that.
Plan Number Three was to cut a stake, sharpen it at one end and set it into the ground on a hilltop.
Im coming to get you, moon, said the mantis, and with a whirring of wings, he left the camel thorn tree and flew to the foot of the baobab tree.
That night he hid in a bush from where he watched the moon move slowly towards the stake.
A diviner was a holy person who could foretell the future.
The word mantis comes from ancient Greek and means diviner.
What would happen, he wondered, if one night the moon vanished and never rose again ?
But then a surprise awaited him : when he reached the top of the tree the moon seemed as far away as ever.
When the rising moon was directly above his hiding place he flung the djani into the sky with all his might.
He got to the base of the camel thorn tree then began to climb up the trunk as fast as he could.
And, of course, they are also remembering the small short-winged one who wished to be a god.
That was when evenings shadows began to creep out from under the stones where they had been hiding during the hottest part of the day.
The San regarded the mantis as a special creature with magical powers.
that he didnt want to ride upon the moon either.
All that happened was that the stake cast a long, thin shadow on the ground while the moon moved across the sky, high above.
That plan didnt work quite as well as I thought it would, said the mantis, looking rather upset.
There were even nights when there was no moon at all.
That was when he realised how foolish he had been;
First he wove a rope out of dry grass then he made a noose out of the rope which he tied to the end of a long stick.
As the moon rose into the sky it would pierce itself on the stick and get stuck there.
Very carefully the mantis crept forwards until he was looking down at the moons bright disc floating below him in the pool.
Oh, you foolish moon ! the mantis smiled.
The mantis had noticed that the moon went through different phases as it rose into the sky, so he reasoned the best thing that he could do was to capture it early on, when it first peered over the horizon.
Hed stopped because the moon was there too, and it was caught in the water.
Even the highflying night birds couldnt reach it, so how could a small awkward creature with short, whirring wings hope to get there ?
The djani consists of a length of reed, a partridge feather and a stone all tied together with a short twist of sinew.
But by the time he finally reached the top of the tree the moon had moved on again.
First he noticed the shadows of the thorn trees on the sand, then he saw the birds darting clear and swift across the sky.
Thank you, moon, he said sincerely, bowing deeply to the sky.
He managed to get back to the bank where he stood shivering, wet and confused.
Once upon a time there was a mantis whose greatest wish was to sit on the moon as it sailed cross the sky each night.
Why had he stopped, you may ask ?
My eyes ! he screamed.
He noticed that it kept changing, for example. Then it got bigger again. It rose later each night and it got smaller and smaller every time he saw it.
I need to outwit the moon, he kept telling himself, which is why he came up with Plan Number Four.
How would all the night creatures in the desert survive without the moons glow to help them find food ?
Often the mantis would dream about how proud he would feel gazing down onto the great dry Kalahari Desert where he lived, how his heart would swell as he stared out across the empty watercourses and the herds of springbok grazing amongst the camel thorn trees.
Then the moon began to rise.
That was how he came to be standing next to a waterhole in the desert an hour later.
Later on, when it rose higher into the sky it moved faster and faster and often, just as dawn was arriving, it would swiftly vanish into the heavens even before it reached the horizon.
Nevertheless, with his arms outstretched he leapt up into the air only to fall back into the branches, where he sat disappointed watching the moon float away across the sky and fade into the dawn.
The events you are going to read about happened a long time ago when great herds of elephant and gemsbok roamed across the vast, dry plains of Heikum, which is the name the San people gave to the Kalahari Desert.
What I need now is a new approach, which is when he came up with the idea of trying to trap the moon.
Because he was thirsty and needed a drink ?
Surely, thought the mantis, if I throw the djani into the air it will twist itself around the moon and then the weight of the stone will bring the planet crashing down to Earth ?
It flew out of his hands like a whip.
Except that things didnt quite work out as he expected because when he threw his noose into the air, it simply fell back empty.
All he wanted was to get his sight back and for the pain to go away.
It was only the next morning that the pain went away and the mantiss eyesight returned.
When a djani is tossed into the air it spirals back to the ground like a sycamore leaf.
Up and up and up it went, then down and down and down it fell, back into the branches, the feather fluttering amongst the leaves like a small, injured bird.
All that night the mantis stood praying, swaying gently, begging the moon to give him back his sight.
That is why nowadays all mantises sit with their forelegs held up before their faces : they are praising the moon that forgave their ancestor and restored his sight.
Ill not give up now, the mantis said and began to climb.
Oh, Im so clever.
It was now cradled in the branches of a nearby baobab tree.
But when he looked again, the moon seemed even further away.
Blinded, he staggered away from the waterhole and crashed into some bushes where he tried to rub the splinters from his eyes, but nothing would ease the pain.
Of course, that didnt work either which is when his temper got the better of him again.
When the moon was above him he would run out of his hiding place, throw the noose around the moon and then haul himself up.
What could be easier than that ?
Come back, shouted the mantis, shaking a fist in the air, but his words just echoed in the darkness.
This plan involved the use of a djani, which is a toy that bushman give to their children.
When the mantis could see that the moon was caught in the branches of a nearby camel thorn tree, he crept out of his hiding place and darted across the ground.
This was when the moon was most vulnerable, when it was big and cumbersome and slow-moving.
Time and time again, the mantis hid in the branches of tall trees watching the moon as it sailed across the sky and time and time again he tried to catch it, but without success.
The next day the mantis put his third plan into action.
But the mantis was just an insect and the moon was far away.
He wanted to do this so that he could look down on all the other animals in the desert.
This time my plan is foolproof, said the mantis, looking extremely pleased with himself.
And in the end he came up with an answer.
Immediately the moons reflection was shattered into a thousand dagger-sharp splinters.
His plan was that he would hide amongst some rocks on a hilltop nearby.
Then he began chasing after the moon.
But, of course, he had spoken too soon.
When he looked up he realised the tree was even taller than he expected, so high in fact that its branches seemed to be stretched out amongst the stars.
My plan isnt working, said the mantis after his twentieth failed attempt.
This was when the mantis was the most uneasy.
The Mantis and the Moon
No longer arrogant and proud, now he was just a small and humble insect.
I can still reach it, he said and threw himself up into the air, only to fall back into the branches.
This is the story about how the mantis became known as the praying mantis.
He imagined them looking up at him and saying, Look, there is the mantis travelling on the moon.
This story comes from the San people who live in the Kalahari Desert.
And by the time hed picked it up for another throw, the moon had moved on again.
For a long time the mantis thought about this problem as he sat rocking back and forth on a twig, or resting cupped inside a leaf.
Maybe I need to come up with another idea ?
First he found the stick he needed then he sharpened it at one end before he planted it firmly in the ground.
Ive got you now, he said, then, taking a deep breath, he leapt out into the water, only to sink gasping and spluttering beneath the surface.
Maybe that wasnt such a good idea, he said to himself, reaching for a twig which he then used to try and prod and pry the moon out of the water.
In a fit of temper, the mantis ripped the stone from the djani and threw it on the ground.
Having failed three times most people would give up, but not the mantis who was a very determined fellow.
that he didnt want to be a god any longer;
At dawn it appears in the east and at dusk in the west.
Before long the old man learnt that the boys name was Kileken and that he was an orphan.
That night the old man stayed awake, thinking about what to do.
When Kileken was a long way from the house he stopped and began looking around. He seemed to be checking that no one was watching him.
Kileken where are you ? he called out, but no one answered, so he went to the window and looked out.
Ive never seen my cows look so healthy.And all the chores around the house are done, too.Its just.Its just amazing.
Yes.
In fact, Id enjoy your company.
Besides, not only was the boy a great help he was also good company too.
I dont expect you to do all my jobs, said the old man, but the boy just laughed.
Thats too much.
By daybreak the next morning the boy had done all the things that he had promised.
For this reason, he spent most of his evenings gazing up at the stars, many of which he knew so well he thought of them as his children.
He didnt see the old man hiding behind a bush.
For a while things continued as before and both the old man and the boy enjoyed each others company and a life full of good things.
This story comes from the Masaai, a nomadic people who live in Kenya.
By the time the sun rose he had a plan all worked out.
Sadly, the old man walked slowly home across the cracked and broken earth.
Actually, the old man was puzzled, though he didnt say so.
I dont know.
But were friends.
There was one star in particular that the old man liked more than all the others, but one night when he was out in the bush he looked up into the sky only to see that his favourite star had gone.
That evening when he looked up at the night sky he saw the bright star again that had gone missing on the night he had first met Kileken.
All he could think about was his young friends secret powers ?
It is about the planet Venus, which the Maasai call Kileken.
No.
Yes, even you.
That was when he knew that his young friend, Kileken the orphan boy, had gone back to the heavens.
It became fresh and green and full of life with fountains of water and wooded groves.
All that work youve described will take you two days at least.
Please trust me on this.
A moment later the boy turned into a blazing star and sped upwards into the sky.
Astronomers now call that star Venus.
Yes, you are, and thank you, said the old man, but that still doesnt mean to say you have to do all my work.
So where are you going to sleep tonight ? asked the old man.
In his surprise, the old man let out a cry of shock.
What ?
All the beautiful trees and bushes that had sprung up so suddenly now withered and died.
Crying out as if in pain he threw himself to the ground, hiding his head beneath his hands and moaning with despair.
What special powers ?
I have lots of energy in the morning.
But as time passed, so the old mans curiosity began to grow until he became so obsessed he couldnt sleep at night.
Instantly a bright light began to fill his body.
The next morning, the boy described the jobs he was going to do that day.
He had indeed found out the boys secret but at what cost ?
At first the old man thought his young friend was joking, then he realised that he was quite serious.
The Maasai call it Kileken  the orphan who works long and hard all day.
Oh, dont worry, he said.
When it was going dark, the boy returned to the old mans house.
Just leave it to me, he said mysteriously.
Thats why I can do so much.
He looked up from his bed to see that his young guest had made breakfast and tidied up the house.
Once upon a time there was a very old man who lived alone in a hut.
That was when the old man realised that through his actions the boys magic powers had been taken away.
What could they be ? he kept asking himself, And why wont he tell me about them ?
It started at the tips of his outstretched fingers and spread rapidly down to his feet.
Hello ?
Immediately, the boy turned around and saw where he was hiding.
Even as the old man looked on, the landscape changed from lush, fertile and green to dry, barren and brown.
And Im younger than you, too.
No friends or relatives came to visit him and he only had his shadow for company.
The boy shrugged.
But Kileken just smiled.
I have special powers, said the boy.
When the old man woke up the next morning, he had a very pleasant surprise.
Now he was lonelier than he had ever been.
No, you cant do all that in one day, said the old man, quite shocked.
In the distance he could see the boy out in the fields, tending the cattle.
The Morning Star
You should know that Venus shines brightly in the morning and in the evening.
Satisfied that he was unobserved, the boy climbed onto a rock and lifted up his arms.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Its a secret.
On the way back to his house he met a boy who was also out walking and the two of them struck up a conversation.
Thank you, thats very kind, said the boy and took him up on his offer.
Then when the boy left the hut he followed him at a distance, making sure to keep out of sight.
He searched the heavens for his child for a long time without success then, with a heavy heart, he finally headed back home.
And trust him he did, for a time at least.
I get them from my ancestors.
Then suddenly all the surrounding land began to change.
But I offered you shelter.I invited you into my house !
Special powers ? he repeated uncertainly.
In some parts of the world Venus is called the morning star, and in others it is called the evening star.
The old man thought about this.
Eventually, these questions began to gnaw at him like a great hunger until in the end he decided that he had to find some answers.
Youre welcome to stay with me, he said.
Then the land began to change again, even before the old man could answer.
I begged you not to do this, he said sadly.
How do you manage all this ? the old man asked.
THE MORNING STAR
In fact, not only that but when he brought in the cattle they were fatter and rounder than the old man had ever seen them before.
Then he remembered how lonely he had been before the boy came to stay with him so he decided not to ask too many questions in case he offended his young guest.
Yes, I know, and for that Im very grateful, but if I tell anyone my secret.
When Kileken got up and began to prepare for the day ahead the old man pretended to be asleep.
Im sorry, I cant tell you.
If I tell anyone my secret your good fortune will end.
A moment later, all the colour drained from his face and his eyes filled up with tears.
What he couldnt understand was how one small boy could manage to do so much ?
Yes, said the humans.
Are you quite clear about the message ?
Im sorry, my lord, but I just said what I was told to say, answered the hare, shivering with fear.
Not long afterwards the hare went to see the moon to inform him that the message had been delivered.
Why arent we re-born time and time again ?
Every month the moon is born as a slim crescent, grows to fullness then dies away, only to be reborn a few days later.
Yes, I told the humans that you die every month and that from now on theyre going to die, too, probably outside on the grass.
The Origin of Death
Except that it was a long walk to where the humans lived, and somewhere along the way the hare got confused and jumbled things up.
Not my problem, he said with a shrug and bounded off towards the forest.
I have passed on your message, my lord.
This story comes from the Khoisan, a mainly nomadic people who lived in southern Africa.
The fun in this game comes from the fact that there is always a difference between the original message and the one which finally emerges at the end of the chain.
First the hare coughed to clear his throat then he said very loudly, Every month I am born, then I die sitting on the lawn.
From now on this will happen to you.
The one you gave to the ant.
What do you think ?
Once upon a time the moon decided to send a message to humans down on Earth informing them that they would become immortal and live forever.
The message that eventually arrived at headquarters was : Bring three or four pence, were going to a dance !
Sorry this isnt good enough, shouted the moon and with these words he picked up a piece of wood lying nearby and struck the hare on the nose, splitting it in two.
The one I gave to the ant, but that you delivered on his behalf ?
And what message was that ?
Off you go then, said the moon.
Now, it suddenly occurred to What exactly is your message ? he asked.
Have you ever played the game called Chinese Whispers, where a whispered message is passed from player to player ?
At this remark the moon narrowed his eyes suspiciously.
Yes, my lord, answered the ant, bowing very low.
But thats the message the ant gave me.,
The answer, at least according to the San, is because a simple message went astray and wasnt delivered correctly.
The ant set off, but while on his journey he was overtaken by the hare, who being rather nosy said, Where are you going, ant ?
Before long he was saying, Every month I am born, I die then I greet the dawn.
I have decided that from now on this will also happen to them too.
For example, there is the story of a general who, finding himself under attack one day sent a runner back to headquarters with the instruction : Bring reinforcements, were going to advance !
This cycle of birth, growth and death has been happening for millions of years and continues to happen to this day.
Tell the humans that every month I am born, I grow, I die and then I get reborn.
Yes, I have a message that I have to deliver to all humans.
Eventually, the hare reached the humans, puffing out his chest, he said, I have been sent by the moon to deliver an important message to you.
Seeing the angry look on the moons face, the hare suddenly became so scared he couldnt remember exactly what hed said.
So why are humans not immortal like the moon ?
However, since the moon wasnt able to visit the Earth himself, he decided to use an ant to carry the message on his behalf.
Yes, my lord, said the ant.
THE ORIGIN OF DEATH
That someone else did likewise and so on.
We dont understand your message, one of them said.
The ant, who was already tired and knew what a long journey lay ahead of him, was only too pleased to accept this offer.
Thats why people die at the end of their lives and never get reborn as the moon intended them to  and all thanks to the hare, some people would say.
Maybe you should play Chinese Whispers with your friends and see what happens to a message that you send ?
The runner, unable to make the whole journey himself, passed the message to someone else.
Oh, Im sorry, said the moon, mimicking the hare, though anyone looking on could see quite clearly that he wasnt.
The hare didnt understand the message either, but he was just the messenger, so why should that matter.
Yes, my lord, quite clear.
And you remember the message word for word, do you ?
Oh, you can remember the meaning, can you ?
A nomad is a person who doesnt have a permanent home, but who moves from place to place.
And so the hare set off, bounding across the land, all the time repeating the same message to himself as he went.
Look, remarked the hare, youre rather slow and awkward, arent you ? - The ant just shrugged - So why dont you let me take the message for you ?
Im doing on an errand for the moon, answered the ant.
Every month I am born, I grow, I die and then I eat corn.
That way it will get delivered a lot quicker.
Then they held their breath, waiting for him to speak.
How dare you tell humans I said something that I didnt !
The humans looked at him.
Now since that day the hares nose has been split and all humans still believe what hare once told their ancestors.
From now on this will happen to you too, answered the ant who had failed to inform the moon that he was suffering from a small hearing problem.
But thats not the message I gave the ant ! roared the moon.
Really ? he said.
But perhaps were being too harsh on the hare ?
Yes, the hare said proudly.
An errand ?
Oh, thats very interesting, said the hare.
I forget the exact words I used, my lord, he said nervously. But I can remember the meaning.
OK, he said, without a moments pause.
In the following story, the same thing happens, a message is sent but gets changed over time with disastrous consequences for all concerned, you and I included.
I have a message that I want you to give to all humans, the moon said.
The San now live in or near the Kalahari Desert, which is a large dry wilderness area covering parts of Namibia, Botswana and north-west South Africa.
Naisa stopped next to him and dropped her school satchel on the ground.
It was interesting.
Aice sat himself on the ground next to his sister and picked up a stone arrowhead that was lying amongst the old mans things then dropped it as suddenly again when the old man smacked him on the hand.
Im making an arrow, he said finally.
Aice, of course, was referring to the fact that it was a clever idea, not the temperature.
No, I dont think so !
Yes, I have.
Hey, you cant stop there, Aice said.
Its a complete mystery to me, added Aice, throwing his hands out to emphasise the point.
Long, long before that, the old man muttered.
Does it matter ? asked the old man.
The olden days.
Everyone knew that Aice hated school as much as she loved it.
What are you doing, sir ?
What about you, Aice ?
Then one day the sun-man was thrown into the sky, he became round and turned into the sun.
Naisa squatted down beside him.
What do you mean by that, sir ? she asked politely, By the olden days I mean ?
I prefer the cold weather, Naisa said ignoring the incident.
In the beginning, this sun-man only gave off light and heat around his own hut.
Aice, who was about to make a rather rude suggestion changed his mind when he saw the look that Naisa was giving him.
Are you saying that the climate was different in the past ? she asked finally.
The old man, who had long, straggly grey hair and was wearing a pair of blue jeans and an old t-shirt frayed around the neck, was so intent on what he was doing, he didnt notice the two of them approach until they were almost standing over him.
Exactly.
Theyd had this conversation a hundred times before and now it had almost become a kind of running joke between them.
Our teacher says that all the stars and planets came about after a big bang, he said, but the old man simply ignored him.
You say the sun was thrown up into the sky, right ?
Ill sit over here.
Aice couldnt help smiling at this remark.
Eventually, the old man put down the arrow again, wiped his fingers on his trousers then looked at them both.
The climate changed when the San were the only people on Earth, answered the old man, putting down the arrow and then picking up a length of twine.
Yes, she said picking up her bag and heading off down the road.
Naisa looked at her brother, but his attention had drifted away again.
Aice threw his sister a look of disbelief.
Fun ? he repeated, like the word was new to him.
It was only after his young audience was properly seated, when Naisa had stopped giving her brother nasty looks and when he had their full attention that he became serious again.
Its very hot today, she complained.
After a long pause he said, Well, thats the interesting part.
No, we dont, sir, she said.
Beneath a cloudless sky the land was baking.
Naisa bent down and brushed some of the dust from her sandals with her fingertips.
Its hot today, Aice said, stopping to remove his baseball cap then using it to wipe the sweat from his forehead.
He had gone back to fiddling with the arrow shaft, holding it up to his eye, checking it for straightness.
Not if it was cold like in the olden days you wouldnt, the old man remarked.
Thats news to me, sir, she said.
Aice, who was twelve, and a year older than his sister, shook his head.
Oh, absolutely, sir, Aice answered, though he didnt sound convincing.
That was when he heard her Aice say the dreaded words.
He had dark brown hair that had the habit of flopping down across one eye.
The Sun and the Children is a San story.
You mean before we were born ?.
Give me the winter instead of the summer any day.
Did you know that according to legend our people were the first to live on the Earth ? he asked.
What does that mean : When the San were the only people on Earth ? he asked his sister.
The sun-man would go to sleep on the ground and sometimes, when hed roll over or lift up his arms when he was dreaming, the sun would shine.
The sun and the moon, the old man continued, were originally men who lived on Earth.
The rice they had grown was ready for harvesting but the plants were very wet and needed drying out.
Apparently having finished his story, the old man picked up his arrow again and began sharpening one end against a stone.
Then he grinned at his sister.
Our people had a problem, he began.
Why dont you sit on that stone over there, Naisa, he said giving her a hard shove in the back and almost sending her sprawling.
Would you like to hear it ?.
Naisa glanced across at her brother then decided to answer for them both.
Naisa shook her head.
Then tell us how they did it, demanded Aice.
Aice, who had only been half listening to the conversation, now looked confused.
You see, it was children. It was children just like you who put the sun in the sky.
At first the old man looked ready to argue the point then he seemed to think better of the idea.
They came across the old man sitting at the side of the road in the shade of a baobab tree ten minutes later.
But its just an old, boring old legend, said the man, who seemed to have lost his interest in the whole affair.
What is more interesting is that it was the children of these first people who threw the sun up into the sky.
Naisa, who considered herself something of a geographer, thought about this for a moment.
A story ?
The trouble was, the sun-man spent most of his time asleep on the ground so it was always cold and dark.
The sun shone from the mans armpits, the old man said.
Years and years ago ?.
I dont think interesting is a good word to describe school, he called out. I prefer boring or dull.
We didnt creep up on you.
You havent finished your story.
So you mean everywhere else was cold and dark ? said Naisa.
Then maybe I should tell you the story.
No, we dont, sir, she replied glaring menacingly at her brother.
Yes, of course it matters !
She was slim and pretty and her eyes narrowed as she fixed them on a line of distant hills, shimmering in the heat haze.
So you dont know about the time when we were the only people of Earth ? the old man asked.
Its wrong to pick up things that dont belong to you, he said.
Pushing it back with his forearm, he replaced his hat and set off after her.
Aice said, causing the old man to jerk with a shock and to drop the piece of wood he was working on.
And you havent told us who did the throwing either, added Naisa.
Now he was staring up into the branches high above them.
The dry and dusty road that Aice and his sister Niasa were walking along cut through a mix of parched scrub land, sand dunes and shallow river beds that only carried water after the heavy summer rains.
The old man, meanwhile, seemed to be watching their antics with some amusement.
You just didnt hear us, Naisa said.
The rest of the time it was cold and dark.
Youre the boring one, she shouted then ran off laughing down the road before he had time to answer.
Naisa just shook her head.
School was fun today, she said.
Years ago.
No, you havent !
You shouldnt creep up on a person like that, he said sharply.
THE SUN AND THE CHILDREN
Please tell us, begged Naisa, I hate it when I only get half a story.
The old man seemed to need time to think about this.
Yes, wed love to hear the story, sir, she said then throwing her brother a sharp look, wouldnt we, Aice ?.
Her brother just shrugged.
This time it was the old mans turn to shrug, but you havent told us how this happened.
Then he fixed his eyes on Aice.
The San now live in or near the Kalahari Desert, which is a large dry wilderness area covering parts of Namibia, Botswana and north-west South Africa.
Naisa, meanwhile was getting to her feet and straightening out her dress.
That sounds dangerous, Naisa remarked then mouthed the word Sorry when she saw the look the old man was giving her.
Anyway, the old man continued, Later that day, the two children saw the sun-man lying on the ground and crept over to him.
She had a plan to change things.
Thats why I carry this stick with me, he said, holding up a tree branch.
The moment I close my eyes, the moon comes out.
It was the girl who was the first to find her voice, he continued.
When he saw the two children holding onto his elbows he said, What do you two think youre doing ?
Yes, it was a very good idea, Naisa agreed.
If I have your permission that is ? the old man said looking very darkly at Aice.
Yeah, Duh !
I mean, sometimes the moon comes out at night and then its quiet bright, but.
Whats so wrong about that ? snapped Naisa.
What do you mean you need my help ? the sun-man asked.
So the boy and the girl got some skins and then when everything was ready the girl counted one, two, three, then they lifted up the sun-mans elbows.
Then the job would be quick and easy, dont you think so, Sis ?.
They shouldve done that in the first place, said Aice, knowingly.
That was silly of him, grumbled Aice.
Naisa, however, chose not to answer.
And do you know what she did ?
I havent got to the end of the story yet, so maybe I should finish it.
The boy and girl pleaded with the sun man.
She told her children that if the sunman woke up they were to tell him to do his job.
Then she jerked her arm back.
Plan B, said Aice helpfully.
So, do you want to hear the story or not ?.
Of course the sun-man was hot !
The womans plan was that her son would take hold of the sun-mans left elbow and her daughter would take hold of his right elbow and then, on her signal, they would lift them up.
Then he looked at Naisa.
Do you really ?.
He sounds grumpy, said Naisa, but the old man didnt answer her.
When it gets too big and too boastful I use this stick to prod it until it bursts like a balloon.
What do you mean she had a plan ? asked Aice.
The moon got thrown up into the sky by the children, too, the old man explained.
Well, maybe the girl thought hed be warm not hot.
The mothers plan was simple : All the village children hid around the sunmans house.
Do you two think you could stop arguing ? said the old man, looking from one to the other.
That was when the sunman came to life angry at being disturbed.
Youd need some very thick gloves, her brother said when they were a hundred metres down the road. To pick up the sun, I mean.
That was a very interesting story, sir, he said, but I think Naisa and I would have done a much better job of getting the sun-man into the sky than the children in your story.
So youre telling us the sun-man was so lazy he just lay on the ground all the time, said Aice.
I always think its very important to have a Plan B ? Aice remarked looking very pleased with himself.
Yes, I suppose so, Aice agreed, looking rather thoughtful.
Aice was drawing a circle on the ground with his foot and then next to it another smaller circle.
The sun-man was very hot, you see.
Thank you, sir, she said.
And the moon ? asked Naisa.
Aice muttered something under his breath that neither of them could hear, but didnt argue the point.
If you ask me, hes not a very nice person, remarked Naisa.
Mr Sun-man, she said very politely, we need your help.
Yes, thats right.
His job was to fly across the sky with his arms out so that the sun shone down on the rice fields.
The boy and the girl went home to their mother, taking with them the bad news that the sun-man wouldnt help them.
What did she expect ?
Did you know that according to legend our people were the first to live on the Earth ? he asked.
She told her children to creep up on the sun-man when he was asleep.
She called her children to her.
Please carry on, sir, said Naisa. My brother wont interrupt again, will you, Aice ?
One of the mothers had an idea however.
Every month the moon gets bigger and bigger.
He was snoring loudly and very slowly the girl reached out and touched him on the hand.
But I thought she was supposed to tell the sun-man to do his job ? said Aice.
Suddenly, a blast of heat and blinding light spilled out onto the ground.
That was when the little girl told the sun-man how cold they were and that they needed the sunlight from his armpits to dry the rice theyd grown, but the sunman didnt seem to care much about their problems.
She explained to her children that all the heat and light in the world came from the sun-mans armpits, but that it stayed cold and dark because he lay on the ground most of the time.
Right ?. I guess so, Aice giggled.
Dont talk to me about the moon, the sun-man shouted.
That was when the sun-man became very cross.
No, sir, we dont, Naisa answered.
But she had a plan.
Of course Im right ! he retorted, but then Im always right, arent I ? he added with a grin.
You see, it was children. It was children just like you who put the sun in the sky.
Oh, the woman had thought of that, too.
The moment the boy mentioned the word moon he went red in the face and looked very angry.
Yes, sir.
Is your brother always like this ? he asked.
Aice looked at his sister.
Yes, Aice, she said patiently, Im sure youre right.
Then to her brother, Come, Aice, weve got to get home now.
I dont think interesting is a good word to describe school, he called out. I prefer boring or dull.
Do his job ! Aice laughed.
Really ?. Yes.
And I thought you said you wouldnt interrupt again ! the old man said darting a look at him.
But what would happen if the sun-man woke up ? asked Naisa.
Yes, well she didnt, did she, answered the old man, sounding even more irritated, if that were possible.
When he fell asleep again, they all rushed up, grabbed his arms and legs and threw him up into the sky, where he grew big and fat and turned into the sun.
I thought you said that he went to live in the sky ?.
After that all thats left is its backbone, which is how the new moon is born.
I wouldnt do that, said Aice.
That was when the girl came up with the idea of wrapping some skins around the sunmans elbows so that they wouldnt burn their fingers when they lifted up his arms.
It starts small and thin, slowly gets bigger and bigger until the sun pokes it with its stick then the cycle begins again.
No, Im sure you wouldnt, the old man said giving him a hard look, but the two children in the story were polite and did what they were told.
Im sorry my brother seems to have left his manners at home today.
And one of those thick jackets and a protective helmet, the type that firemen wear.
It follows me everywhere.
I like to sleep in the dark too, agreed her brother.
Its so full of its own importance it swells up.
Things dont always go as planned, you know !
That was a good idea, wasnt it ?
The boy touched the sun-mans elbow too, and he also jerked his hand back because hed burnt his fingers.
Then he gave a huge sigh and told them to go away and leave him alone.
You carry on, sir, he said very generously, making the old man close his eyes for a moment before continuing.
Naisa just shrugged as if to say that she couldnt understand boys either.
The sun-man eyed the girl very suspiciously, said the old man, picking up the story where he had left off.
That was when all the mothers got together and came up with a second plan.
Cant you see how dark and cold it is ? they said, but the sun man said that he liked the dark because he slept better.

On behalf of the Provincial Government of KwaZulu-Natal, I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the Zondi clan, the family, relatives, friends and the community of Msinga, particularly the people of eNgome.
KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government has taken a decision to name the new Development Centre at eNgome, which is scheduled to be officially opened next month, the Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi Development Centre.
I thank you.
In 2007, the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs approved a stipend system for Izinduna who are members of traditional councils.
In honour of this development activist, the
We would prefer to have no crime at all.
Murder decreased by 10,7; Attempted murder decreased by 6,6; Rape decreased by 1,8; One of the programmes envisaged for the, soon to be established, Centre for Reconciliation and Dialogue will be to promote the heritage of peace and help young people to desist from violent and criminal activities.
We did not know that this event, on 3 January 2009, would be our final encounter with the living Inkosi Zondi.
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi passed away at a time when government programmes, to improve the traditional leadership system in the province, are beginning to bear fruit.
In 1994, a new democratic era dawned on South Africa.
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was the ultimate model of the kind of partnerships an Inkosi should, nowadays, establish in order to improve the lot of his people.
In addition, officials from the Greater Manchester Police have trained volunteers to do local patrols.
Most of what Inkosi Bhambatha lived for, fought for and died for has been achieved.
The deployment took place in priority areas.
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was murdered at Umlazi, exactly nine days ago, on 22 January.
On 11 June 2006 we assembled, at eNgome, to pronounce that we rescind the decision of the Governor of the colony of Natal, passed on 23 February, 1906, to depose Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi.
The remaining districts will soon have the programme as well.
And so Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi was, posthumously, re- instated by this caring Government.
This is in accordance with the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003 and the KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act, 2005. For the first time, women and youth are legally expected to participate in matters regarding traditional institutions.
However, we are confident that, together, we can turn the tide against crime and we are, certainly, achieving some success in this regard.
Again, in 2008, the travelling expenses for all Amakhosi were reviewed to be in line with the Department of Transport tariffs.
This was done in consultation with the South African Police Service.
We live in the age of hope through peace, democracy and development.
He was a modernist who valued traditions and the change of traditions to suit modern times.
In 2008, the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs employed Managers for all eleven Local Houses of Traditional Leadership.
Indeed, we have lost a transformational leader, an Inkosi who put his people first, and saw government as a strategic partner in the development of his area.
These volunteers are working together with the Police to ensure that people are safer in their communities.
Crime and criminality is a scourge that continues to bedevil our communities.
Consequently, Joint Coordinating Committees were established between local municipalities and traditional councils.
Fighting for the development and freedom from poverty of his people was a tradition which he inherited from his great-grandfather, Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi.
The success of the 2006 commemoration can be attributed to Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondis progressive outlook towards life.
After various consultations, the Volunteer Social Crime Prevention Programme was first piloted in selected municipal districts such as Ugu, Uthukela, Amajuba, Ethekwini, Umgungundlovu and Umkhanyakude.
We are assembled here today to lay to rest the late Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi, a descendant of Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi - the hero of the 1906 Poll Tax Uprisings. In 1906, the colonial government of Natal imposed a poll tax on all African males in the province.
Other Distinguished Guests Members of the Media Ladies and Gentlemen
Government is working tirelessly to reduce crime.
While most citizens are working hard towards building a peaceful and prosperous KwaZulu- Natal, criminals, who are a minority, are spending their time planning the destruction of lives and property.
Most of what Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi lived for and believed in is being achieved everyday.
Our people are living in fear of criminals.
Inkosi Bhambatha Zondi was murdered by colonial forces at Mome Gorge in June 1906.
We will continue to declare war on crime.
Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi was very instrumental in the partnership that the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government established with the Zondi people during the 2006 Commemoration of the Centenary of the 1906 Uprisings.
In 2006, Government established the Provincial House of Traditional Leadership and 11 Local Houses of Traditional Leadership.
Today we live in the age of hope and respect for human dignity.
ADDRESS BY KWAZULU-NATAL PREMIER SIBUSISO NDEBELE AT THE FUNERAL OF THE LATE INKOSI MBONGELENI ZONDI HELD AT ENGOME NEAR GREYTOWN ON SATURDAY, 31 JANUARY 2009
This is helping to close the gap between crime and the fear of crime.
We say farewell to this friend of peace, democracy and development.
The last pieces of the gathering of evidence are being put together and arrests will be made soon.
Annual crime statistics for KwaZulu-Natal reflect that in the 2006/7 and 2007/8 financial years, the following trends emerged :
Besides normal policing, the Provincial Government has also implemented the Volunteer Social Crime Prevention Programme which enlists volunteers from the community to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.
The National Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003 and the KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act, 2005 ushered a new phase in the administration of traditional institutions.
Furthermore, in 2008, all out of pocket expenses for traditional council members were reimbursed by the department.
Izinduna will be able to have financial resources that will help them to fully and effectively execute the tasks of traditional councils.
He presented many proposals to Government, all aimed at bringing a better life to the people of eNgome.
Programme Director, Mr. President of the African National Congress, Mr.
To promote partnerships and synergy between traditional institutions and municipal structures, the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs held joint Exco meetings between municipal and traditional leadership structures.
To date, 1 200 volunteers have been identified and trained on basic first aid and self-defence.
The SAPS are currently closing in on his murderers.
The process of transformation in traditional leadership structures has resulted in, over 90, of traditional authorities being transformed into traditional councils.
On 3 January, 2009, the President of the ANC, Mr. Jacob Zuma, and I were here at eNgome at the invitation of the late Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi and the Zondi clan, who hosted a ceremony in honour of the ANC President and I. Inkosi Mbongeleni Zondi always worked towards strengthening ties between his community and government.
Such a hut could form an appropriate head for the Provincial Mace thus linking the Provincial Coat of Arms and the Provincial Mace.
It plays an important role in African Culture. His Majesty the King is referred to as the Ingonyama. The Lion also represents an important feature of the State Emblems of India as well as in the British Royal Arms.
This is flower has long been associated with the Province as a floral emblem and represents the natural beauty of the Province.

Having understood this, it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves  what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed, as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 !
President Nelson Mandela and Madame Graca Machel;
Investment in the economy, by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11, with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8.
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living, we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion. But that was not to be.
increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world.
His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today.
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
to intensify the housing programme;
We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people, regardless of race, colour and ethnicity, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream
I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Womens March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the Presidents box, as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces, proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today.
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
At an average of over 4,5, the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994.
We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office, fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty, and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa.
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
We must today renew our pledge, to speak together of freedom, to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream, to say, together, in action  enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society !
Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse.
It was a place in which squalor, the stench of poverty, the open sewers, the decaying rot, the milling crowds of wretchedness, the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse, assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets, and wooded lanes, and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass, and birds and houses fit for kings and queens, and lyrical music, and love.
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended :
It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others, guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living, who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst, and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause.
We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy.
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly;
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
Today, fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product  at about 18,4  is at its highest since 1991.
We pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sacrificed for our freedom, as well as to you, our friends from the rest of the world, that we will never betray the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform South Africa into a democratic, peaceful, nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous country, committed to the noble vision of human solidarity.
Once more, we convey our condolences to the Tambo family.
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation;
Ministers and Deputy Ministers;
The work to create that South Africa has begun.
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;
Governor of the Reserve Bank;
However, I am indeed very pleased to acknowledge in our midst this morning the Hon Albertina Luthuli, daughter of our first Nobel Peace Laureate, Inkosi Albert Luthuli, whose tragic death 40 years ago we commemorate this year, remembering the tragic day when it was reported that he had been crushed by a speeding train in the cane-fields of KwaDukuza.
On that occasion we said in part :
It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage
At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month, the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside, reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last, 2004, elections.
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;
None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty.
Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year, we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband, the father of her children, her companion, her comrade, and an eminent son of our people, Oliver Reginald Tambo.
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament;
Fifty years before, as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, the patriots of the day had said, Let us speak together, all of us together  African and European, Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom. And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free.
When she died, we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital.
Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains.
President F.W. de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk;
That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom.
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary;
With your indulgence, I would like to step further back, and recall what we said, in 2004, as representatives of our people, in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world, convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day, the 10th anniversary of our liberation, and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic, whom our Parliament had chosen, respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections.
The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years.
Our honoured traditional leaders;
This relates to everything, from the improvement of the health of our people, to reducing the levels of crime, raising the levels of literacy and numeracy, and opening the doors of learning and culture to all
Heads of our Security Services;
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2007
For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy;
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;
to increase spending on scientific research and development;
People of South Africa :
We have gathered here today, on Freedom Day, because in time, our people, together with the billions of human beings across the globe, who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent, decided to say  an end to all that !
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period, we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases, many of which are much more complex.
In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;
The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years.
This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.
It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone, 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture, representing a growth rate of about 4.
Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low.
As such, in the period leading up to 2009, the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda.
A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion.
What has emerged, among others, as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants.
These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started, the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system.
It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have, in the recent period, been within manageable ranges, as the programmes reach maturity.
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
For instance, in September last year, 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50; and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
On that occasion we said in part :
We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme.
It is a matter of pride that, in line with our commitment to build a caring society, we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage.
In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes, the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery, assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted.
Compliance levels within departments, in relation to public service and finance management legislation, have been somewhat mixed.
President F.W. de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk;
What is of concern, though, is that in many of these municipalities, many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions.
This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities, continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market.
The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us.
I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime.
to intensify the housing programme;
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;
In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities, the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC, the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society, in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation.
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation;
As Honourable members are aware, we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport.
Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored.
However, as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way, the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected.
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended :
These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year.
Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue, even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent.
In this regard, in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA, over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past, government will this year :
and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27. From owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004, this has increased to close on to 5;
According to the United Nations Development Programme, South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation.
Promoting peace and security will involve all people.
Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication;
In this regard, the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial.
I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative, working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team, concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption, as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system.
In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006 :
Obviously, we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime.
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly.
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;
We should indeed celebrate this great achievement.
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water. Many more are without electricity and sanitation.
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year, so that, in addition to improving the work of the police, we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public, in which huge resources are expended, are actually met.
And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level.
It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits, and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February.
In the meantime, we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage.
Over the past three years, the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs.
In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said :
Certainly, we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear, closeted behind walls and barbed wire, ever anxious in their houses, on the streets and on our roads, unable freely to enjoy our public spaces.
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;
It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks, informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Agenda, which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures, the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public, and strengthening the Ward Committees  80 of which have been established across the country.
While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income, the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations.
We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year.
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will :
This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development.
On the other hand, very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution.
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things :
An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004, though at a slow pace.
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living, we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion. But that was not to be.
to increase spending on scientific research and development;
At the same time, the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995.
Fifty years before, as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, the patriots of the day had said, Let us speak together, all of us together  African and European, Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom. And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free.
While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service, and while we have improved the training programme, we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security.
The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries.
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises.
Further, on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers, we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging, reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together !
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate, inflation and interest rates, so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets, and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers;
Honourable Members;
The work done during the course of last year, by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments, including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty, does point to some defects in our systems in this regard.
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people.
By 2005, South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal in respect of basic water supply, with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006.
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people.
We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers, across the three spheres of government, in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole.
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004, today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants.
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector.
South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy Rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid, partly through rights-based entitlements.
We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts, to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs.
But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs.
and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery.
This applies to literacy levels, gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates.
This will ensure sustainability, and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities.
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
This applies to such issues as wage levels, personnel vetting systems, enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles, and so on.
We are proud that within one year, we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half.
And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure, improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services, among others, are implemented.
Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation.
We must act to change this situation.
Peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness, drug trafficking, gun running, crime and especially the abuse of women and children.
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;
Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate.
We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.
Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections, induction programmes were conducted, taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new.
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent;
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace.
We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up.
These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy, combining both road and rail.
The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population;
And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth, we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs.
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
Access to electricity, water and sanitation has improved.
The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement.
The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing, with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process.
We should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free.
We hereby wish to pledge, on behalf of the people of South Africa, that we will, in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies, do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security.

In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
However, while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development, we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict, particularly the general peace process in Sudan, including the situation in Darfur, Cte dIvoire and Somalia.

One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations.
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended :
But no one, except ourselves, shall ensure that this dream is realised. We are not there yet.

In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine, Israel, Iraq, Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent, our partners in India, Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China, other countries of the South, as well as Japan, Europe and North America.

to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC, as well as Burundi, the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development.
We should today, even more confidently, speak together of freedom.
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will :

We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront. Since the popular mandate of 2004, we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better.

Issued by : The Presidency February 2007
We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found, and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition.
But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that, working together, we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all, in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
Honourable Members;
Thank you.
Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits, to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia.
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
Critical in this regard, are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable, based on the need to achieve national reconciliation.
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators, government Ministers and departments, our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy.
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
Similarly, we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes.
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;

to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
Just over a month ago, South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study, the National Income Dynamics Study.
In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level, intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational;
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development, while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres; conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government, as well as the Offices of the Premiers, while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments;
further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership.
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year :
For instance, in September last year, 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50; and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.

In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.

As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey, which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country.
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended :

Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about  from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba. Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
Honourable Members;
Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation.
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
In this regard, two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007.
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time, to further our understanding of such issues such as migration, labour market transitions, inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution.

Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent;
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
In this regard, we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground, and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service, in order massively to reduce case backlogs;
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level, intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational;
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development, while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres; conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government, as well as the Offices of the Premiers, while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments;
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies, and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws;
Further to improve its service to the people, government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency.
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year :
For instance, in September last year, 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50; and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.
Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
On that occasion we said in part :
complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;
In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
President F.W. de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk;
to intensify the housing programme;
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;

In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said :
improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating.
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
In this regard, we must respond to the cold reality that, as in other countries, the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention.
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will :
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things :

Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region.
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work, and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums.

speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project, implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the Bus Rapid Transit System in the Metros and recapitalisation of Metrorail : and in this regard, let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SANTACO will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project, and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly;
On that occasion we said in part :
continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police, and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years, and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced;
complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;
In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation, government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC.

a wage subsidy for low-wage employees, possibly directed at first entrants into the job market, especially young people;
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly.
The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies.
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;
We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened, and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible.
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water. Many more are without electricity and sanitation.
All these efforts, Madame Speaker and Chairperson, must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security.
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres, including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system;
Rather, what is required is effective organisation, mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement, intelligence and corrections officers, and functionaries of the justice system.

Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about  from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba. Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
Honourable Members;
The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families, in defence of our freedom and our security.
expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries, increasing the number of training institutions, improving the quality of training, and instituting a bursary system;

to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;

We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion, including the comprehensive and integrated anti-poverty strategy we have mentioned, as well as address issues pertaining to national unity, value systems and identity.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R.
For us it is not a mere clich to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society.
In addition, Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons, as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector. These centres will be established in areas identified by government.

start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services, especially in respect of border control, and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard;
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods.
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies, and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws;
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year :

Quite clearly, in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy, these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy.
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
On that occasion we said in part :
complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;

In this regard, we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition, which brings together government, business, labour, training institutes and others.

A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly.

Starting this year, resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need, who enter these institutions.

In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said :
Because of this, during the course of this year, we will among other things :

In this regard, we must respond to the cold reality that, as in other countries, the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention.
The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries.

Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes, including capital goods in ICT, transport and energy : with regard to energy, we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation, natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy.
We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about  from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba. Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
Honourable Members;
As the Honourable Members know, we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools.
With regard to communications, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers.
In the discussions thus far conducted within government, consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include :
The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans.
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years, we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible.
The principle guiding this approach is that, over and above social assistance provided through the government budget, we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity.
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign, complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government;

take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund; ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency, SEDA;
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service, in order massively to reduce case backlogs;
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level, intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational;
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development, while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres; conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government, as well as the Offices of the Premiers, while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments;
start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services, especially in respect of border control, and improve the work of the interdepartmental coordinating structures in this regard;
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies, and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws;
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year :
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing, tourism, bio-fuels and chemicals, and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper, clothing and textiles, metals and engineering;
For instance, in September last year, 27 of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50; and in Mpumalanga only 1 of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.
Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
On that occasion we said in part :
complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;
In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
President F.W. de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk;
to intensify the housing programme;
to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation;
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended :
But no one, except ourselves, shall ensure that this dream is realised. We are not there yet.
finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning, in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy;
In this regard, in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA, over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past, government will this year :
and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27. From owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004, this has increased to close on to 5;
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity, by filling vacant posts, improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution;
continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals, and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers;
Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication;
In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006 :
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly.
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water. Many more are without electricity and sanitation.
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres, including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system;
In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said :
Because of this, during the course of this year, we will among other things :
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
In this regard, we must respond to the cold reality that, as in other countries, the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention.
develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation, agriculture and agro-processing, the white goods sector, creative industries, community and social services and pharmaceuticals.
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will :
In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing, government will this year :
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things :
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include :
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living, we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion. But that was not to be.
to increase spending on scientific research and development;
We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront. Since the popular mandate of 2004, we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better.
Fifty years before, as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, the patriots of the day had said, Let us speak together, all of us together  African and European, Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom. And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free.
bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology, and ensure the optimum utilisation of the fingerprint database  indeed, many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems;
Madame Speaker and Chairperson :
We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about  from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba. Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region.
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society.
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
Honourable Members;
In the discussions thus far conducted within government, consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include :
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign, complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government;
implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections;
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent;
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
What she expects as her birthday present is the truth.
further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and,
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term, the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities on which it must focus in a special way, using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue.
Heads of our Security Services;
This having been said, it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding.
They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices.
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today, and trust that we will not disappoint her.
My answer to this question is a definite No !
And so I quote these words :
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
We acknowledge, both among the Honourable Members and our guests, the many founders of the United Democratic Front, 25 years ago.
I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela, one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy, who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year.
More than at any other time, the situation that confronts our nation and country, and the tasks we have set ourselves, demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one, to do all the things that have to be done, understanding that in a very real sense, all of us, together, hold our own future in our hands !
All these honoured guests, representing both memory and hope, remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans.
As we act together everywhere in our country, this we must also understand that what we have to be about is  Business Unusual !
Indeed, they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people, and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people.
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
In the past two weeks, the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation.
In this situation, we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin.
I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004.
I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties.
The main categories of these priorities are :
While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs, they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic, nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous South Africa.
Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government;
There are concrete actions each individual, household and business can take.
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament;
Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation, to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year.
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders;
They are concerned about some developments in our economy, especially the steady increase in interest rates, food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor.
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations, with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations.
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections.
This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges, but surmountable challenges.
On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency.
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity.
The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course.
To make certain that this happens, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities.
He suggested that this morning, to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us, I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel, A Tale of Two Cities.
You will ask whether I agree with this assessment, whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion, in which all of us cannot but lose our way, unsure of our steps, unsteady on our feet, fearful of the future !
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development
In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream.
But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation, we will all come through  I hope relatively unscathed This is not a time for finger pointing, but for working together in finding solutions.
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people.
People of South Africa :
Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters.
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008
I say this because, in our own estimation, it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream.
As the Honourable Members know, she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster. And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.
Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require ingenuity, especially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the development of alternative power supplies.
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
The details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the Power Conservation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published.
The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government, the national, provincial and local, at both executive and administrative levels, are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people.
We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman, representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago, who include Nelson Mandela.
These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you, our compatriots, may give to us and share with one another.
As I was preparing this Address, one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow.
Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner, the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago.
Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution.
Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting, solar water heating and geyser load management in households, including housing standards for all new houses and developments.
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy;
The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy.
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy, and poverty eradication
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly;
And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today.
Governor of the Reserve Bank;
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
Ministers and Deputy Ministers;
As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge.
The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest, that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people, but also to many others outside our borders.
In this regard, I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American, Cynthia Carroll, when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week, on Tuesday, February 5.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
Among other things, we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient.
Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation.
And precisely because it is a period of challenges, it is also an era of opportunity !
We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-saving measures.
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary;
I speak here today in the presence of my mother, Epainette Mbeki, MaMofokeng, who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei, among whom she has lived for many decades.
They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month.
We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy, efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes, so that the lives of our people should change for the better, sooner rather than later.
She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders, that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country, whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today.
In eight days time, on February 16, she will be 92 years old.
This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police, the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes.
We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe, son of the outstanding patriot and leader, Robert Sobukwe, who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment, banishment and other forms of repression.
Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place.
An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not.
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us, it will do its best to live up to the imperative  Business Unusual !
I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy, as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all.
Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States.
Mr Jacob Zuma, Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress;
However, and not unexpectedly, it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard.
The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004.
However, like all the Honourable Members, I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow.
Happily, this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which, the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week.
Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom.
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year, and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves.
further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and,
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
The sense that we get, across all sectors of South African society and further afield, represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations, is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !
We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects.
This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end.
Heads of our Security Services;
Further, after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme, which we identified last year, we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign.
We must therefore continue to support the mining industry.
Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector, we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables.
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient.
I am certain that the South African Football Association, our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira, and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud.
the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60, thus benefiting about half a million men;
Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year, and the projects that the joint team of government, labour, business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition will be intensified.
And so I quote these words :
This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans, including freight and other logistics, energy pipelines, information and communications technology, road infrastructure, water and electricity, both in terms of their timing and geographic location.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
Indeed, energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity.
At the macro-economic level, we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability.
Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned.
We shall also, during the course of this year, process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates, complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security, further give life to the Victims Charter, pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders, and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud.
Madame Speaker and Chairperson
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women, with emphasis on providing training and markets, including linking them up with established outlets;
We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the countrys war against poverty, in pursuit of socioeconomic inclusion.
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system, benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners.
Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge.
Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction, we continue to address a number many weaknesses, including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill, the finalisation of the land restitution cases, the support programme for those who acquire land, and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme.
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
Working together with business and labour, we shall also develop as urgently as possible, key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist, such as mining and minerals beneficiation, consumer durables, retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises, construction, the creative industries, agriculture and agro-processing.
We will launch this synchronised process soon, guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees.
The main categories of these priorities are :
Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation.
Madame Speaker and Chairperson, When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament, we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime, but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder  bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy.
Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government;
We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry.
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament;
However, given our large base of installed generation capacity, for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity.
The second issue is about geographic and place names, which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose.
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders;
At the centre of our economic programmes is, and should always be, the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans, acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all.
We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements, with intensified efforts, as a matter of urgent priority, to accelerate universal access to water, sanitation and electricity, so that by 2014, we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services.
Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme, employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups, enhancing employment search capability, improving education and training, improving services and assets among poor communities, specific interventions in poor households, and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors.
As the Honourable Members are aware, some of these initiatives are already under way; but we are certain that, if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner, the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime.
Accordingly, we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco.
The Ministers of the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week.
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country.
Accordingly, last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population, to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality.
At the same time, we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year.
Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition, infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions, we have decided, in the spirit of Business Unusual, work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes.
Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency.
As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation.
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan, with specific emphasis on energy efficiency.
I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January.
I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully.
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development
In this regard, R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy.
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises.
The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies, as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans.
People of South Africa :
Among other things, this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level, from national to local, bringing together the judiciary and magistracy, the police, prosecutors, correctional services and the Legal Aid Board, as well as other interventions, including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums.
We must ensure that we sustain this approach.
Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year.
As the Honourable Members know, she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster. And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.
Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require ingenuity, especially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the development of alternative power supplies.
The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination.
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP;
intensifying the Expanded Public Works Programme which, by surpassing the set targets, has shown potential to absorb more entrants : this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure, doubling the number of children enrolled in Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed, and increasing the number of caregivers.
An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development.
Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan.
In this regard, I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can.
Task teams are currently working in many areas.
For this, we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development, Provincial and Local Government, Trade and Industry, Agriculture and Land Affairs, Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations, which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency.
Cutting across these plans, and therefore a critical priority, is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right.
Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric during the course of last week, GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf.
As such, in the spirit of Business Unusual, government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help, in the intervening period, to alleviate their plight in those individual households.
In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol, Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint.
We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period.
We are taking steps to enhance Eskoms maintenance capacity.
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy;
introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small, medium and micro-enterprises; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed.
We are a minerals resource economy.
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy, and poverty eradication
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly;
Of great importance, our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens, inspired by the principles of rule of law, respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights, which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements.
Governor of the Reserve Bank;
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
Ministers and Deputy Ministers;
Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime, as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter, including the reform of the Criminal Justice System, we shall by the end of March this year, interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime.
The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters.
They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings, Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency.
Indeed, we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills.
All these actions, taken together with the electricity saving measures, will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin.
Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us, inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual !
Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes, which should be finalised by the middle of the year.
I will also shortly announce a team of Energy Champions consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges.
These are :
Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained.
I will convene a meeting of the Joint Presidential Working Groups to coordinate our overall actions.
In this regard, in the spirit of Business Unusual, Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new, modernised, efficient and transformed criminal justice system.
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges, the sector education and training authorities, resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles, freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees, and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates.
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation, transmission and distribution capacity will continue; and where possible, some projects will be accelerated.
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary;
In any case, most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated.
These include children, women, the youth, people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly.
Already, money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation.
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid.
What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management, efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies.
Of course, I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament.
Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14.
It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country, we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry.
But we will all agree that our society, and the poor specifically, cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops  important as these may be.
Among others, we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment.
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS. We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7, train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment.
speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition, better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support, and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa to provide micro-credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates, and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5 per year, and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up;
This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today.
R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme;
Mr Jacob Zuma, Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress;
This must inspire Bafana Bafana, as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year.
scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the Military Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force from the current 4 000 to 10 000.
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme.
This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008.
Two such issues deserve brief mention.
In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements, we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum, and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme.
further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and,
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
At the same time, we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March.
Heads of our Security Services;
Over the past year, we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face.
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
At local government level, we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies.
the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60, thus benefiting about half a million men;
And so I quote these words :
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning.
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment, we are still on course !
Madame Speaker and Chairperson
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women, with emphasis on providing training and markets, including linking them up with established outlets;
What is outstanding, however, is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution.
To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard, SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done.
We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can, together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments.
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens.
As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations.
I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history  to strain every sinew of our being  to respond to the national challenges of the day, including those relating to our economy, the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world, and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided.
The main categories of these priorities are :
In the same measure, we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard, and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round.
Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue, as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace, and implement their reconstruction and development programme.
Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government;
Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management.
In this regard, this year, in consultation with public sector unions, we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided.
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament;
The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit, which can only grow from strength to strength.
These include issues relating to the Constitution, security, media and electoral laws, and other matters that have been in contention for many years.
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders;
Further, it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties  a task that belongs to the leadership, the public servants themselves and the trade union movement.
As the Honourable Members are aware, some of these initiatives are already under way; but we are certain that, if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner, the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime.
This includes improving the information technology systems, training of staff on the new systems, rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card.
We will, of course, continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council.
It is in this context, as well, that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union, within the context of the process led by the African Union, to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible, premised on accelerating the development of our region.
Secondly, by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities.
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
Working with other social partners, we shall ensure that, by the end of this year, the second National anticorruption Programme is adopted, and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented.
A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration.
There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to, as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state.
This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China.
We are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad, developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent.
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development
Accordingly, we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter.
People of South Africa :
Our focus, in promoting the African Agenda this year, will be on the strengthening of the African institutions, including the African Union and its development programme, Nepad.
As the Honourable Members know, she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster. And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.
Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require ingenuity, especially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the development of alternative power supplies.
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP;
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament, including the necessary constitutional amendments.
We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda.
Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples, particularly in the developing countries, we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums, the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement.
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community, and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard.
But we should not take this for granted.
Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism.
We had an opportunity, on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter.
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy;
introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small, medium and micro-enterprises; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed.
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy, and poverty eradication
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly;
Firstly, it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging.
Governor of the Reserve Bank;
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
Ministers and Deputy Ministers;
These global responsibilities, including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity.
In short, the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address.
Thank you.
I am confident that, under the leadership of the International Marketing Council, Trade and Investment South Africa, Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual, and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010.
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya, Chad, Burundi, Darfur in the Sudan, Western Sahara, Cte dIvoire, Somalia, the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability.
These are :
Critical in this regard, is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision.
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation, transmission and distribution capacity will continue; and where possible, some projects will be accelerated.
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary;
Thus, as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans, covering all spheres of government.
With all hands on deck, and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion, we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels.
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard.
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans, women and youth, we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements, including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment.
Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;
This we shall do, inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels.
Having said all that I have said, I come back to the question : what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008 !
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS. We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7, train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment.
speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition, better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support, and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa to provide micro-credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates, and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5 per year, and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up;
We are confident that, informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity, the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives.
R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme;
Next year, South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001.
Mr Jacob Zuma, Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress;
If anything, the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants.
Thirdly, recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizens life, we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by Cabinet.
In this regard, we salute that brave son of our people, Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high, in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom.
In the First Decade of Freedom, economic growth averaged 3 per year, and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007.
I have walked that long road to freedom.
Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings, appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds, housing, financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment;
In the end, the challenge is as much about regulation;
We are also heartened that research into HIV prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection.
Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women, youth and people with disability.
However, while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service, this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves.
Indeed, it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003, the economy created about one-and-half million net new jobs;
and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient.
I am certain, that, as part of and in addition to, these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system;
and local action and implementation for development, including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services.
But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday, the 7th and 8th of February respectively.
This suggests that the poverty situation has improved remarkably, particularly among people experiencing the greatest degree of welfare deprivation.
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments;
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups, we have improved awareness around issues that affect them;
However, much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants, especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public.
and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns.
Madam Deputy President;
We do have today a well-functioning democratic system, based on principles of transparency and openness, with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy.
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition.
Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region, and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society.
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production; the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality.
Though some progress has been made, at 0,2, the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government, measured against the 2 target we set ourselves.
On a critical matter of detail, the researchers further observe :
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans.
In this regard, some five years ago, we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22, closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014.
Except for the services sector, we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors, especially manufacturing.
This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods, especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime.
For instance, access to potable water has improved from 62 in 1996 to 88 in 2008;
This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports.
And so, 15 years into our democracy, we can assert that the fear, the insecurity and the loathing that 100 years ago generated an exclusive and illusory peace among colonial masters, were not only unfounded; but truly misplaced.
Ironically, precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty, is where infrastructure, administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive.
All these are assignments for the coming period.
With regard to household access to basic services, the figures speak for themselves.
and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability.
A hundred and thirty years on, we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts.
These are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address.
and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the 2004 democratic mandate !
Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures;
Thus, the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations.
We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who, on 27 April 1994, for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands.
This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies, as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds.
Indeed, these observations are confirmed by our own research, which shows that income poverty especially among African and Coloured communities has declined, partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants.
This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda.
Fourthly, government will sustain and expand social expenditure, including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men.
In education, we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio;
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress;
It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented, ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks, integrated industrial policy and programmes, the skills challenge, regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner.
Further, our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world;
In this regard, Honourable Members, I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners, we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society.
At the same time, much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas.
Comrades and friends;
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament;
Secondly, we will intensify public sector employment programmes.
Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service, including financial management, Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations, izimbizo and, as currently in the Department of Home Affairs, firm leadership.
On its part, government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors, and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis.
Chief Justice Langa;
and even more remarkable, about 500 000 jobs a year between 2004 and 2007.
But ours is a journey of hope and resilience.
advancing equity, developing skills, creating economic opportunities and extending services;
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures, indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully, even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections.
The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations, in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes.
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor, the target for 1-million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008, a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate.
Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods.
I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends, critically, on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole.
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak;
As Honourable Members will be aware, our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus.
Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage.
and crimes against women and children have not abated in any significant measure, is a matter of great concern.
It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system, both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management.
Secondly, although the reductions in poverty have been substantial, aggregate inequality increased during the 1990s. Thirdly, the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition, but inequality has not improved.
That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus, through the United Nations, on the approach to negotiations in South Africa.
Combined, these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects.
In a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy.
These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity, as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC;
It points to systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice system, from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders.
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices, before the voters roll is closed.
It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that  whatever economic storms may pound our shores, whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition  our nation is in a good state.
But let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life, such transformation is still at its nascent stages.
But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.
Of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high, and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society.
We hope that all political parties will, as they finalise their electoral lists, make their contribution to this noble endeavour !
Indeed, government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service, which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society.
Honourable Members;
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries;
Indeed, in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions, South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth, even if at a slower rate.
In this latter period, for the first time since the attainment of democracy, more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market, thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007.
HIV impacts most severely on young women.
In this regard, we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiros cousin, Pat Tlhagwana.
These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward.
While our approaches may differ, the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our Constitution : to create a united, nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world.
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
This improvement is mirrored in access to basic services  a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in money-metric poverty.
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society;
and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion :
Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines, appropriate staffing levels, and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity.
The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans.
I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face.
but it is expanding all the time, with over 690 000 patients having been initiated on antiretroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme.
For inspiring hope in a period of despair, we salute them.
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson;
to provide efficient, decent and equitable health care;
The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards.
almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level;
That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system, reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive  old and new  and the steady hand of our public sector managers.
In this regard, we have through legislation, international conventions, regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children, women, people with disability and the elderly.
Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action, including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment.
We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems.
access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse; But we are all too aware that, because we are strongly integrated into the world economy, demand for our exports has declined;
The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years.
It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience, continuity and change, by former President Nelson Mandela, in his biography, Long Walk to Freedom :
Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO, which included : Strini Moodley, Professor Barney Pityana, Steve Biko, Onkgopotse Tiro, Harry Nengwekhulu, Themba Sono, Mapetla Mohapi, Mosioua Lekota, Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi.
These then are some of the advances that democracy has brought;
as it is about consistent enforcement.
Above all, I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today  worlds apart from the divisions, conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago  is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life.
but from the point of view of government systems, we can draw solace from the fact that over 70 of cases of corruption reported in the media become public because government has detected the wrongdoing and is in fact acting against it.
I have made missteps along the way.
creating more jobs, better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment, public works programmes, sector partnerships and strategies, local procurement, small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives;
And so, Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson, we should ask ourselves : how have our actions defined the path of South African societys evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy;
Wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life.
What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis.
The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade, and the efforts, especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact.
Alternatives to layoffs will be explored, including longer holidays, extended training, short time and job-sharing.
On the one hand, plans to expand employment in sectors such as health, social work, education and law-enforcement agencies will continue.
Of course, this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs, including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy.
However, we should not underestimate the challenges we face.
We can do all this; and we will be perfectly justified.
On the other, we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme.
Yet, the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations.
I have tried not to falter;
Importantly, sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption, ensuring that there is decent work.
It may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate;
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work;
that we should indeed, in the words of the Freedom Charter, open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture !
Firstly, government will continue with its public investment projects, the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years.
In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale, the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students, and his peers.
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly; State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa, Kgalema Motlanthe, to the joint sitting of Parliament, Cape Town February 2009 Mr. Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation.
While the consumer boom, impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates, played its part in this regard, we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward.
Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities.
and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the electorate.
Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu, brother of Kalushi, representing the Mahlangu family.
We may even say that, in a strange quirk of fate, many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past;
Thirdly, mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants.
and an improvement in the number of pupils passing mathematics, to quote a few examples.
A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago.
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town;
Allow me, Madame Speaker and Chairperson, in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections, so that we can shape our destiny ourselves.
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear, among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana, in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands.
These include, in the first instance, higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors.
While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999, by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million.
Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports.
What, on the surface, started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch, with severe consequences for actual production and trade.
and malaria cases have massively declined.
It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth.
The same challenges confront the private sector.
In this regard, we should salute the late President of the African National Congress, Oliver Reginald Tambo, for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country.
But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough, not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime.
In reality, a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential.
Overall, we are proud of the advances in our social programmes.
I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President.
They include Brian Bunting, Billy Nair, Ncumisa Kondlo, John Gomomo, Joe Nhlanhla, Cas Saloojee, John Schippers and Jan van Eck.
Naturally, the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers.
It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August, 1989  commonly known as the Harare Declaration.
As such, we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation.
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security;
I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society.
Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms.
Governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor, in the form of housing  with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided.
We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better.
This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality.
Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell.
This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure.
Violence against women and children is much too high.
While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today, it was based on racial oppression and exclusion.
We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries.
But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change.
In addition, trends in performance, both in terms of teaching and learning, show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past.
to underscore the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sacrificed for, refusing to be cowed by setbacks and hardships.
These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high.
It is steadily growing stronger, underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world.
There is no gainsaying that, by any measure, the progress made since 1994 has been impressive.
And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years, if not decades, as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village.
Government is painfully aware that abject poverty is still too widespread in our society; and the level of inequality is too high.
On both counts, the private sector is lagging far behind.
Indeed, the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest  which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful  is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy.
As a consequence, some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult.
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament.
Be it in education, health, housing, water or sanitation, the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption.
We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage.
But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense.
Over the years, we have steadily improved the structures of governance.
To these, I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman, a truly distinguished South African, who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old.
In this regard, where necessary, we will find creative ways to raise funds.
It is a matter of proud record that, for instance, female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care;
But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.
95 of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility; and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water.
These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation.
On this we still have some way to go.
I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society.
Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance.
and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come.
In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message, that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth.
The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people.
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament, Traditional leaders;
Within South Africa, it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future  bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life.
To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch, led by Professor Servaas van der Berg :
Among households that include children, the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically between 2002 and 2006.
The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase;
All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this.
And because we have a low savings rate, we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes.
Within public and private institutions, the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern
It is common cause that, after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s, South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940.
Daily experience, in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike, is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack.
That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation, in the place of war and conflict, reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is, the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa.
Our democracy is healthy.
This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone, in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture, their demographic composition, and their systems of accountability.
Our economy has become more open, and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system.
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85;
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago, that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity;
This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant, which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008.
I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come.
As such, the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries.
All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994.
We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres, and improved integration within and among them.
Rather, I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of visions.
In the centres of learning, the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership.
Six years ago, leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans, particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014.
In some of these facilities, management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement.
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections.
This is reflected, among others, in legislation, rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike, partnerships with civil society and the business community, as well as anti-corruption hotlines.
As we look back over the past fifteen years, I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration, the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary;
We can decry the greed, the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis.
Of course, the overall crime rate, having peaked in 2002, has consistently declined.
We still have a long way to go.
Mine is a responsibility, within a matter of a few months, to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections, and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running.
Firstly, money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century.
Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country, we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all.
Yet, in being brutally self-critical, we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys, by far, better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country.
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings, appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds, housing, financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment;
And we do hope that this time round, the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit, so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories.
These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy.
In the end, the challenge is as much about regulation;
and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment.
We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africas pursuit of excellence over the past year.
But beyond this, the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity  to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world.
Indeed, it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003, the economy created about one-and-half million net new jobs;
I am certain, that, as part of and in addition to, these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system;
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments;
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups, we have improved awareness around issues that affect them;
Madam Deputy President;
In this regard, we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book.
At the same time we will improve SADCs interaction with the Common Market of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community. These initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weaken the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the Southern African Customs Union.
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production; the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality.
On a critical matter of detail, the researchers further observe :
In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections, we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate.
We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world.
And so, 15 years into our democracy, we can assert that the fear, the insecurity and the loathing that 100 years ago generated an exclusive and illusory peace among colonial masters, were not only unfounded; but truly misplaced.
but, hopefully, also with regard to political dialogue.
This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better.
Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004;
Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures;
We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity.
In education, we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio;
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress;
Further, our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world;
There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery.
Comrades and friends;
In addition, we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits.
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament;
We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA;
In our own country, we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path.
Chief Justice Langa;
The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis;
advancing equity, developing skills, creating economic opportunities and extending services;
Giniel de Villiers and his team have won the Dakar Rally;
Critically, we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system, complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations, and ensure that development aid is not scaled down.
But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later.
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak;
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Childrens Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60.
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures, youth development, the rights of people with disability and childrens rights  including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy, preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament, and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency;
Secondly, although the reductions in poverty have been substantial, aggregate inequality increased during the 1990s. Thirdly, the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition, but inequality has not improved.
strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability;
creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government, including national strategic planning;
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC;
This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature, philosophy and commerce, interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africas wealth.
Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic, equitable and transparent manner.
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now.
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation.
Honourable Members;
Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries;
Now the work of reconstruction can start in earnest;
In this respect, there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country.
And so, in the words of former President Mandela, dare not linger, for long walk is not yet ended.
In this regard, how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way, will be of paramount importance.
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations.
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society;
and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion :
These and other programmes, including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February, form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future.
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson;
to provide efficient, decent and equitable health care;
almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level;
We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure, among other things, that as input prices decline, the benefit is felt by the population.
access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse; But we are all too aware that, because we are strongly integrated into the world economy, demand for our exports has declined;
It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience, continuity and change, by former President Nelson Mandela, in his biography, Long Walk to Freedom :
These then are some of the advances that democracy has brought;
Indeed, over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century.
creating more jobs, better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment, public works programmes, sector partnerships and strategies, local procurement, small enterprise promotion and support for cooperatives;
And so, Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson, we should ask ourselves : how have our actions defined the path of South African societys evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy;
and to that we can attach no price !
implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country;
We can do all this; and we will be perfectly justified.
We are of course Rugby World Champions;
I have tried not to falter;
intensifying the campaign to save energy, so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour, while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources  recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change, resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing;
It may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate;
and South Africa stands ready to assist wherever we can.
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work;
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly; State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa, Kgalema Motlanthe, to the joint sitting of Parliament, Cape Town February 2009 Mr. Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
We are also encouraged that, whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity, that progress is inexorable.
We may even say that, in a strange quirk of fate, many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past;
The abiding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale, not only to stem the impact of the crisis; but also to put in place measures that would obviate a recurrence.
We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region.
Just two weeks ago, South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu.
Virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion  from stadia, transport infrastructure, security measures, issues of accommodation, to health and immigration plans  confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament.
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town;
integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme, support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives;
intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system, including better forensic capacity, rapid increase in the number of detectives, optimal utilisation of information and communications technology, and better management of the courts;
As would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months, South Africa will use the privilege of chairing SADC to strengthen this critical regional institution, with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion.
We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular.
Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and, with it, the freedom to choose their path of development.
We wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of Zambia, Ghana and the United States of America for elections the symbolism of which transcends the narrow boundaries of their nation-states.
The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat.
submitting the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development to Parliament;
The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life, of especially civilians  including children, women and the elderly  indeed defies description.
We are confident that, because it cares, the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail.
I thank you.
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security;
It is steadily growing stronger.
We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations, delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is, a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face.
but beyond this, that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary.
Over these years, it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership.
In the same measure, we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi, Sudan, Western Sahara, Cte dIvoire, Somalia and elsewhere.
Steadily but surely, our continent is progressing towards her renaissance, with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders agenda, asserting her hope and her resilience on the world stage.
Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions, our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe.
Government is painfully aware that abject poverty is still too widespread in our society; and the level of inequality is too high.
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament.
continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way;
It is a matter of proud record that, for instance, female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care;
95 of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility; and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water.
continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System, including the matter of National Health Insurance;
our Paralympians continue to do us proud;
This initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition.
Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator, former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion.
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament, Traditional leaders;
We are truly heartened that, yesterday, the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution, laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government.
This, and this in the main, is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state.
To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch, led by Professor Servaas van der Berg :
The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase;
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85;
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago, that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity;
And we believe that, after five consecutive wins, the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations !
and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays.
We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-EU Summit later this year.
We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China.
We believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system;
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia, and countries in Asia, the Middle East, as well as Latin and North America.
It is this, and this alone, that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country.
As we look back over the past fifteen years, I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration, the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary;
Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings.
As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action, we will pay particular attention to :
We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm, the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us.
However, we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable.
Significantly, the exclusion of black people from this Union was one of the chief reasons for the formation of the African National Congress in 1912. 
On this great day, let me also acknowledge the role played by the 
President Botha worked with the former Minister of Justice, Mr 
We are celebrating this day with former political prisoners who we have specially invited to join us. 
The jobs are in areas like construction, home and community-based care, and environmental projects. 
She was for a long time, a lone voice in Parliament, calling for change. 
Allow me to mention the role played by former President PW Botha. 
Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders; 
Honourable Speaker; 
Special international guests, especially the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Mr Jean Ping; 
The release of Madiba was brought about by the resolute struggles of the South African people. 
I stand before you this evening, 20 years since President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of prison. 
Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life  the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country, workers and schoolchildren, can be part of the occasion. 
South African and foreign media; 
As we celebrate Madiba's release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white. 
It was this that laid the groundwork for the historic announcements by President FW de Klerk, 20 years ago. 
I stand before you, not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people. 
I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands. 
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy. 
Many of those who lost their jobs were the breadwinners in poor families. 
The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by December 2009. 
These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation. 
Honourable members, 
Honourable members, 
He was, among other things, a member of the Rivonia defence team. 
We have identified some areas of improvement, which we will effect going forward, including ensuring more labour-intensive projects. 
President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela; 
late Ms Helen Suzman. 
The crisis cost our economy about 900 000 jobs. 
Honourable members, Fellow South Africans, 
Compatriots and friends, 
You will off course recall that the masses of this country, in their different formations, responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable. 
We know that these and other measures cannot fully mitigate the effects of the recession. 
Government introduced a training lay-off scheme to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retrenchment. 
We congratulate the overall winner, Charlotte Le Fleur of Worcester Secondary School, and all the participants for the hard work. 
Fellow South Africans, 
His wisdom was also displayed in the Harare Declaration, which he wrote and championed. 
These efforts were enhanced by our Public Works Programme. 
Two hundred and sixty six children from all provinces participated in the pre-State of the Nation debate on the role of the youth in the fight against poverty. 
Chairperson of SALGA and all local government leadership; 
As we mark this centenary later in the year, we should reflect on how far we have travelled as a country. 
It was he who initiated the discussion about the possibility of the release of political prisoners. 
Former political prisoners and veterans who are with us here witnessed that because they were part of that process. 
We also recognise the role of the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who also called for Madiba's release, as well as that of other political prisoners and the return of exiles. 
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; 
The Industrial Development Corporation has put aside R6 billion to help companies in distress. 
On this special day, we must also acknowledge the contribution of those within the leadership of the National Party, who eventually realised that apartheid had no future. 
We are pleased to be joined by members of the legal team in the Rivonia Treason trial  Lord Joel Joffe, who is now based in London and Judge Arthur Chaskalson. 
Honourable Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa and all esteemed members of the Judiciary; 
These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income, work experience and training opportunities. 
We recall the words of Madiba on his release, when he said and I quote: 
We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set. 
Deputy President of the Republic, Honourable Kgalema Motlanthe; 
In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally. 
Harry Schwarz, who sadly passed away last week. 
In the next three years, an additional two million children from poor families and households, aged 15 to 18 years, will benefit from the Child-Support Grant. 
They became a symbol of the sacrifices of many who bore the brunt of apartheid. 
Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today. 
They played a significant role in the process leading to the release of Madiba. 
Our father, Former President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia; 
We are meeting against the backdrop of a global economic crisis. 
We greet the leadership of the ruling party and Alliance partners, for whom this is an extra special occasion. 
Kobie Coetzee, who was in turn assisted by Dr 
In February last year, government, business, labour and community representatives agreed on a package of measures to reduce the scale and impact of the crisis. 
Deur saam te werk, kan ons meer bereik. 
We also remember and pay tribute to Mr 
These moments in our history demonstrate our ability to come together, even under the most difficult of circumstances, and to put the country's interests first above all other interests. 
Former political prisoners and veterans; 
In this, President de Klerk demonstrated great courage and decisive leadership. 
Honorouble Speaker; 
We have put many of these measures in place. 
We extend our gratitude to our friends and comrades in the international community, for fighting side by side with us to achieve freedom. 
Honourable members, 
We reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to the international community for its unwavering support to our struggle. 
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; 
President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a non-sexist, non-racial, democratic and prosperous South Africa. 
We extend a special welcome to the Mandela family. 
11 February 2010 
Honourable members, 
We are grateful for the spirit of family, community and voluntary work that inspires many people to help those most affected by the crisis, through these difficult times. 
During the course of this year, we will mark the centenary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa, which was established in 1910. 
Members of the diplomatic corps; 
It was his outstanding leadership, foresight and clarity of vision that led the ANC to intensify the pursuit of a negotiated settlement. 
Honourable compatriots, 
Distinguished premiers and speakers of our provinces; 
We have implemented decisive anti-recession spending by government, especially on infrastructure. 
We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion. 
Former President FW de Klerk; 
To ensure a safety cushion for the poor, we brought social grant increases forward, and extended the Child-Support Grant to children over 14 years of age. 
This created a unitary state. 
Neil Barnard and Mr Mike Louw. 
We welcome in particular those who have travelled from abroad to be here, Helene Pastoors, Michael Dingake from Botswana, Mr Andimba Toivo ya Toivo of Swapo in Namibia. 
Former deputy presidents;
