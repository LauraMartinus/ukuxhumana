Poverty alleviation and empowerment - through broadening participation in the economy and narrowing the gap between the first and second economy 
Province of 
the President himself to set the following goals for government at a national level: 
do not have a representational process . As a result , most of them are undercapitalised , in the same way that a firm is undercapitalised when it issues fewer securities than its income and assets would justify . 
The enterprises of the poor are very much like corporations that cannot issue shares or bonds to obtain new investments and finance . Without representations , their assets are dead capital . 
This is the mystery of capital 6 / 2 0 0 7 B U D G E T S P E E C H 
In the next five years the government will invest nationally more than R400 billion in infrastructure to create jobs and fight poverty . 
In crafting the budget proposals , we went to great lengths to listen to the voices of the people across the province , particularly the poor , disempowered , jobless and homeless . 
PROVINCE OF KWAZULU-NATAL 
The poor inhabitants of these nations  the overwhelming majority do have things , but they lack the process to represent their property and create capital . 
Journey to Prosperity 
These investments and interventions will occur under the auspices of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa , the overall goal being to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014 . 
Deputy Speaker 
But we were proud to announce that the journey had begun! This year the journey to prosperity for all in the province continues . There will be no change in direction or our end destination . 
In opening the National Parliament in 2005 , President Mbeki said , our country , as a united nation , has never in its entire history enjoyed such a confluence of encouraging possibilities . 
Provincial Growth Fund 
But Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come Whispering it will be happier ;

KwaZulu-Natal 
In tabling the provincial budget for 2005/06 in March last year , we announced a comprehensive plan to transform the regional economy . This would be achieved through three main interventions: 
I am only merry for an hour or two upon a birthday: 
BUDGET 
Third World and former communist nations 
As we enter into a new MTEF budget cycle , it is appropriate to report on the governments performance and progress in respect of these three interventions . 
200607 Presented to the Legislature on 16 February 2006 
Tourism-based development projects 
We noted the universal cry for jobs , decent housing , and access to basic services such as water , health care , electricity , etc . Three consistent themes raised by the community emerged during the roadshows: 
PROGRESS REPORT ON BUDGET AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2005/06 
INTRODUCTION OF THE PEOPLES BUDGET 2006 
This province will not lag behind in achieving these national developmental goals . Thus in this years budget there is an increase in funding for all votes , including that of basic services and infrastructure provision . 
The provincial government has achieved positive results in its efforts to grow the economy and to achieve sustainably higher growth rates , in partnership with the private sector . 
As we reflect on the year gone and focus on the dawn of a new year , I am reminded of the words of Alfred Lord Tennyson in his drama entitled THE FORESTERS when he said: 
New dam construction in the Amajuba District 
Mr Speaker , these examples provide hard evidence that we can convert economic potential and project ideas into new businesses and jobs . 
A joint-venture three wheeler Manufacturing Plant in Msundusi 
The first aquaculture project has been approved by the Growth Fund . The Amatikulu Prawn Farm , with a project value of R36 million , is in implementation phase , 
Market and Trading complexes in Edendale , Osizweni and Paulpietersburg 
Toyota Automotive Supplier Park in Prospecton 
Manganese smelter in Newcastle region 
Mtunzini Shrimp Farm 
The target is to have R1 ,5 bn committed investment into the Fund by June 2006 . 
A Biodiesel Plant in northern parts of the Province 
Msuluzi game park 
A major shipbuilding and related marine project called the Bayhead Marine Industrial Park , has been approved and has received R24 million funding through the Growth Fund . 
Projects aimed at reviving rural towns and industries 
The provincial government has already committed some R500m to the Fund , and Standard Bank R375m . 
Job creation and economic growth projects 
and will create 76 permanent jobs within the first year of operations and up to 350 jobs by phase 3 . 
Infrastructure for textile firm expansion in Mpofana municipality 
The projects business plan anticipates that a total of 350 permanent jobs will be created . 
In addition to these two projects , a number of other projects to the value of R3bn are currently being considered 
by the KZN Growth 6 / 2 0 0 7 B U D G E T S P E E C H Fund . 
A Wine Cellar Project in Estcourt

INTERVENTION TWO: Poverty alleviation and empowerment 
Trade missions and inward investment initiatives 
To date 3820 cooperatives have completed training at FET Colleges 
Business Plans have been received to date by Ithala , of which 784 have been approved ; 
The President emphasised in his State of the Nation address two weeks ago that support for the small business sector and the development of cooperatives is a national priority and a key element of ASGISA . 
We therefore invite private sector enterprises and project promoters to join us in creating real growth in the Province . 
Poverty alleviation fund 
In this province , certainly , government regards the cooperative movement as the key to freeing the millions of our citizens trapped in the second economy 
An ethanol plant at Nkwalini 
the integrated primary school nutrition programme , 
water quality enhancement in drought affected rural areas , 
I need hardly remind honourable members that the central theme of the peoples budget tabled a year ago was the need to narrow the gap between the first and second economies 
The R500m allocated to the Poverty Alleviation Fund in the 2005/06 budget has been put to good use and funds were allocated on Cabinets approval to 
Further announcements on the details of these and other projects resulting from these trade and investment initiatives can be expected in the next few months . 
the critical areas of water and sanitation provision at schools ; 
Agreement in principle by Piaggio , a leading Italian auto manufacturer , to establish a manufacturing plant in the province for the production of low-cost three-wheeler scooters ; 
Narrowing the gap between the first and second economies and broadening participation in the economy 
The total value of approved business plans is R110m , of which R39m has already been paid out ; 
and the cooperative incubator programme . 
I am very pleased to be able to report measurable progress in all these major programmes . 
access roads and pedestrian bridges to schools and clinics ; 
Mr Speaker , we are very excited about the progress recorded in establishing , financially supporting and capacitating cooperatives around the province . 
It is now my honour to formally table the Appropriation Bill , 2006 for the province of KwaZulu-Natal for the consideration of this House , together with the Budget Statements . 
I will again close with the words of Alfred Lord Tennyson: 
but Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come whispering: it will be happier Indeed Mr Speaker and Honourable Members , IT WILL BE BETTER . 
I thank you . 
My thanks go to Sipho Shabalala and his officials in Treasury , and to Ms Fikiswa Pupuma and her officials in Economic Development , 
I also wish to thank the officials in my departments who have assisted me in the task of finalising the budget documentation we table today . 
and to my team in the Ministry , now under the leadership of Ms Sibongile Shezi . Lastly , to my wife May and family for their support and understanding . 
For most recipients of the old age grant , this monthly transfer is their only source of income , which they rely on to buy food and other basics . 
Over the next three years , the 2008 Budget allocates more money to extend social grants to men between the age of 60 and 64 , 
Government originally allocated R8 .4 billion to build and upgrade these stadiums . 
Building a new power station , Medupi , at Lephalale . This will generate an additional 4 788 MW of electricity , 
Five stadiums are being upgraded 
The main changes to the budget for the next three years are: 
Children who do not receive a grant may also be exempt from paying school fees , depending on their parents level of income . 
National Budget? 
South Africas economy will be affected by this slowdown , but our economy has a strong foundation , the public finances are sound , investment is rising and the long-term outlook for growth is healthy . We will weather the storm . 
The old age pension , disability and care dependency grant grow from R870 to R940 a month 
A 750 ml bottle of wine will cost 9 cents more 
Many other government programmes support vulnerable households . Children who receive social assistance do not have to pay school fees . 
but is still healthy growth for a country such as South Africa . And most importantly , we will continue to invest for the future . 
Because of these constraints and because of the weaker global environment , our economy is likely to slow down , growing at about 4 to 4 a year for the next three years . 
Construction of a pump storage project , Ingula , in northern KwaZulu-Natal . Ingula will generate 331 MW of electricity by 2012 and an additional 993 MW by 2013 . 
A 750 ml bottle of liquor will cost R2 ,17 more 
We are planning for every aspect of the event - from electrical power to broadcast and telecommunications , visitor accommodation , tourism , city promotion and beautification . 
- in Johannesburg , Mangaung , Polokwane , Rustenburg and Tshwane . The upgrading process began in September 2007 . 
Over the past 10 years , government has gradually increased its coverage of children through the care dependency , child support and foster care grants . 
To address the urgent electricity supply shortage , Eskom , which is owned by government , is investing about R342 billion over the next 5 years in new power plants . 
Developing Project Bravo , near Witbank , which will provide an additional 4 818 MW . The first generating unit will come online by July 2012 and the last unit in December 2015 . 
Preparing for kick-off: the 2010 FIFA World Cup 
Measures to encourage employers to provide bursaries to the children of low and medium income employees 
To meet these tight deadlines , required contractors to work quicker . To respond to cost increases , an additional R1 .2 billion has been allocated , taking the total amount provided for stadiums to R9 .6 billion . 
We have much work to do . 
R2 .6 billion more for agriculture and land reform R2 .7 billion extra for forensic laboratories and additional police personnel R2 billion more for correctional facilities 
The Gas1 project , which will add 1 036 MW of capacity to already completed open cycle gas turbine plants . 
Budget Highlights 
Return to service of three power stations that were in long-term storage - Camden , Komati and Grootvlei - which jointly provide an additional 3 677 MW . 
Our economy has experienced its longest period of economic expansion in over 50 years , growing by an average of 5 per cent a year for the last five years . Since 2001 , we have created about 1 .5 million jobs . 
Short-term capacity expansion includes: 
Due to growing electricity demand , Eskoms ageing plants are operated at maximum capacity , which often leads to equipment failures and less electricity available to the national grid that powers South Africa . 
Social grant increases and extension of our grant system 
Total tax relief for individuals of R7 .7 billion 
We are planning health and disaster management , event operations , safety and security , volunteer training and recruitment , environmental rehabilitation and waste management , event communication , legacy and cultural activities . 
R12 billion more for social grants 
As a result , we have been able to provide more resources for education , health , social grants , housing , policing , public transport , stadiums , roads and prisons . 
R7 .6 billion more for public transport , roads and railway infrastructure 
In addition , a total of R9 billion is allocated to public transport projects related to the World Cup . 
The 2008 Budget also makes provision to phase in a reduction of the age of eligibility for men from 65 to 60 years - which is the same for women . 
Together with reduced capacity when plants are shut down for regular maintenance , this means that Eskom is not able to generate enough electricity to meet demand by households and industry . This results in power cuts . 
In 2008/09 , total spending on grants will increase to R69 billion , which is 10 of total government spending . 
A simplified tax regime for small businesses 
A Peoples guide . 
However , tight deadlines were set . Stadiums needed for the Confederations Cup had to be finished by December 2008 , and the 2010 stadiums had to be finished by December 2009 . 
Foster care grants grow from R620 to R650 a month . 
Cup are being rolled out rapidly . We are building stadiums , training venues , fan parks and public viewing areas . We are improving public transport . 
An additional R6 .7 billion for HIV and Aids , hospitals and tertiary services , TB- MDR and XDR R2 .5 billion for industrial development and 
Five new stadiums are being built - in Cape Town , Johannesburg , Mbombela , Nelson Mandela and eThekwini . Construction began in 2006 . 
R1 .4 billion more for higher education , research and knowledge development Tax proposals 
increase the coverage of the school feeding scheme , improve the conditions of schools and hospitals , accelerate the delivery of water and sanitation , invest in public transport , raise salaries for teachers and nurses , 
It describes how government will raise money and how it will be spent . The national budget divides money between national departments , provinces and municipalities . 
The old age pension is one of main the pillars of our grants system . 
such as old age and childhood , or if they are disabled and cannot work . The available grants are the old age pension , the disability grant , the child support grant , the foster care grant and the care dependency grant . 
A reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 28 per cent 
We are also taking steps to make government work better for the people , and to get more value for each rand spent . 
increase the number of prosecutors and magistrates , expand the capacity of prisons , encourage people to save electricity , and boost our trade and exports . 
Capital investment 
Investment in electricity 
A 340 ml can of beer will cost 7 ,2 cents more , and 
As the economy has grown , we have come up against some limitations . The shortage of skilled people , insufficient electricity , 
This is slower than the past five years , 
traffic congestion and cement shortages are all signs that the economy is reaching its speed limit . To grow faster , we have to invest even more in skills , in infrastructure , in machinery and equipment , in roads and public transport . 
NATIONAL TREASURY BUDGET 2008 
Social grant increases for this year are as follows: 
Spending highlights 
Construction of two gas-fired power plants - open cycle gas turbines in Mossel Bay and Atlantis . These will provide an additional MW . 
The foundation of our economy is strong and will be tested over the next year or two . With the right policies and hard work from all South Africans , 
R5 billion in tax subsidies set aside over the next five years to support investments in labour intensive industries and to support governments industrial policy 
In February of each year , the Minister of Finance announces governments spending , tax and borrowing plans for the next three years . This is called the national budget . 
Because of rapid economic growth and proper management of the public finances , government spending has grown rapidly since 2001 , much faster than economic growth . 
A packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 66 cents more 
Long-term capacity expansion includes: 
Host cities will also receive funding of R684 million to conduct operations during the 2009 Confederations Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup . 
This makes South Africa one of the worlds biggest spenders on social grants . 
All children under the age of 6 are entitled to free primary health care . All beneficiaries of social grants who are not members of private medical aid schemes are fully subsidised to receive health services at public hospitals . 
Through getting better results from public spending and through higher levels of investment , we can lift our economy towards a growth rate of 6 . 
Fuel taxes will increase , as from 2 April 2008 , by 11 cents per litre 
Eskom has 26 power stations with the capacity to generate 37 761 megawatts of electricity in total . However , only 35 436 MW is normally available , with MW used exclusively during peak times . 
The child support grant grows from R200 to R210 a month on 1 April 2008 , and from R210 to R220 a month on 1 October 2008 
we can grow even faster and make a bigger difference to the lives of all of our people . 
Together , these investments will increase South Africas long-term capacity to provide power to homes and businesses . However , the electricity crisis also shows the need for all of us to conserve electricity and use it more efficiently . 
World economic growth is slowing down and there is more uncertainty in global markets . This year , the world economy is likely to grow more slowly than any time since 2001 .
