pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a a ( h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 ) 2009
as the minister of health , i am person@@ ally writing to you regarding the above disease for two reasons :
to give you information that will assist you person@@ ally to deal with the disease
to request your assistance and personal invol@@ vement and that of your high office in effecti@@ vely communic@@ ating key m@@ ess@@ ages on inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a a ( h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 ) 2009 within your community .
the official scientific name of this disease is pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a a ( h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 ) 2009 .
it star@@ ted in me@@ x@@ ic@@ o and the uni@@ ted st@@ ates of am@@ er@@ ic@@ a in april this year .
it was initi@@ ally kno@@ wn as sw@@ ine f@@ l@@ u because it was th@@ ou@@ ght to have origin@@ ated from pi@@ gs .
now , it is under@@ st@@ ood that it is a mix@@ ture of human and avi@@ an ( bir@@ ds ) ele@@ ments .
h@@ ence , the disease has no@@ thing to do with the consum@@ ption of por@@ k or por@@ k products .
it is now si@@ mp@@ ly referred to as pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a or pre@@ fer@@ ably by its official name , a ( h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 ) 2009 .
sin@@ ce april this year , the virus has spread rap@@ id@@ ly to 16@@ 6 countries glob@@ ally .
in africa , it has so f@@ ar spread to only 16 countries .
at the time of writing this letter , the virus had affected 17@@ 7 45@@ 7 people ( labor@@ atory confir@@ med ) glob@@ ally with 1 45@@ 7 confir@@ med de@@ ath@@ s .
in south africa to date , we have confir@@ med 2 8@@ 44 cases with six de@@ ath@@ s .
after the f@@ our@@ th emergency committee me@@ eting held on 11 jun@@ e 2009 , the world health organisation ( who ) conclu@@ ded that the crit@@ eria for a glob@@ al pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c had been met and the director@@ -general , dr mar@@ g@@ ar@@ et ch@@ an , declared a pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c ( phase 6 ) .
this si@@ mp@@ ly means that the disease has spread to countries in all reg@@ i@@ ons of the who and was spre@@ ading very f@@ ast .
ho@@ we@@ ver , i wish to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ se that the declaration of a pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c does not me@@ an that the disease is vir@@ ul@@ ent .
it si@@ mp@@ ly means it is spre@@ ading all over .
on 6 j@@ uly , the who descri@@ bed the spread of the pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c within affected countries and to new countries as in@@ ev@@ it@@ able and un@@ st@@ op@@ p@@ able .
for@@ t@@ un@@ ately th@@ ough , while this may be so , they no@@ ted that most people who contract the virus will have mil@@ d systems .
ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , as health offici@@ als , glob@@ ally and loc@@ ally , we are still wor@@ ri@@ ed by the de@@ ath@@ s that have so f@@ ar occ@@ ur@@ red ( glob@@ ally 0@@ ,@@ 8 and in south africa 0@@ ,@@ 2 of the affected people ) .
the virus mo@@ st@@ ly affec@@ ts individu@@ als in the age group 10 to 29 years â most of these individu@@ als are in schools or institutions of higher learning .
the who advis@@ ed that countries must conc@@ entr@@ ate on mi@@ tig@@ ating the impact of the disease on communities .
in do@@ ing this , effective communication is the key .
mo@@ de of spread
the disease is spread by dro@@ pl@@ et infec@@ tion i.@@ e. when an infected person c@@ ou@@ gh@@ s or s@@ nee@@ z@@ es , and you in@@ h@@ ale the air into which they have s@@ nee@@ z@@ ed or c@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed .
even if they c@@ ough on@@ to a sur@@ fac@@ e and you in@@ h@@ ale the air around that you may get infected ) .
symptoms of the disease
the symptoms can be divi@@ ded into three main categories
se@@ ver@@ e .
mil@@ d symptoms include :
r@@ un@@ n@@ y or b@@ loc@@ ked no@@ se
m@@ us@@ c@@ le ach@@ es and pa@@ in
general fe@@ eling of un@@ well@@ ness .
the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of people wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de have mil@@ d symptoms and will not need any specialised medical care .
people with ch@@ ron@@ ic he@@ ar@@ t or l@@ un@@ g disease
diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a and sign@@ s of de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
se@@ ver@@ e symptoms include mil@@ d and mo@@ der@@ ate symptoms plus :
diffic@@ ul@@ ty in bre@@ ath@@ ing ( resp@@ ir@@ atory distr@@ ess )
b@@ lu@@ e li@@ ps , t@@ ong@@ ue or other parts of the body
se@@ ver@@ e dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess and lo@@ ss of cons@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness .
any@@ body with mo@@ der@@ ate or se@@ ver@@ e symptoms must se@@ ek and receive ur@@ g@@ ent medical atten@@ tion .
provincial spread of the disease
the spread of the disease within our provinces as a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of the total infec@@ tions in our country is as follows :
the six de@@ ath@@ s :
wes@@ tern cape three
e@@ astern cape one
free state one
kwa@@ z@@ ul@@ u@@ -@@ nat@@ al one .
testing for the virus
official testing is done by the national institu@@ te of communic@@ able diseases , situ@@ ated in g@@ au@@ ten@@ g and dec@@ entr@@ alised rec@@ ently to the wes@@ tern cape .
testing will be done on recommend@@ ation by a doctor .
patients who se@@ ek care within the public health system should not be requ@@ esting a la@@ b test .
we note that this is currently the case in the private health sector but this is not recom@@ men@@ ded by the who .
doc@@ tors should tre@@ at suspec@@ ted cases in terms of pro@@ to@@ col@@ s provided by the national department of health .

mass treatment with t@@ am@@ if@@ l@@ u will le@@ ad to mass res@@ is@@ t@@ ance to the dr@@ ug and ren@@ der it us@@ el@@ ess even for those individu@@ als for whom it may be lif@@ e-@@ sav@@ ing .
clo@@ sure of institutions
experi@@ ence throughout the world has sho@@ wn that clo@@ su@@ res of schools and institutions of higher learning , shop@@ ping mal@@ ls and work@@ pla@@ ces has not been effective in stemming the spread of the disease .
in@@ stead , it caused se@@ ver@@ e social dis@@ rup@@ tions .
we adv@@ ise that any lear@@ ner , educ@@ ator or worker with mil@@ d symptoms should st@@ ay at home .
if there are many learners and / or educ@@ ators sta@@ ying a@@ way , then the affected institution should cons@@ ult the department of education , which together with health author@@ ities will adv@@ ise on what course of action needs to be tak@@ en. for@@ ward .

report to citizens
2008 / 2009 financial year
the public service commission ( psc ) was established in terms of section 19@@ 6 of the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 .
it is the only institution established in terms of chapter 10 of the constitution .
the constitution sti@@ p@@ ula@@ tes that there is a single psc for the republic of south africa , consist@@ ing of 14 members , five of which are appointed on the recommend@@ ation of the national assembly .
one member is appointed from each of the n@@ ine provinces , after nomin@@ ation by the premier of the province on the recommend@@ ation of a committee of the provincial legislature .
the members are referred to as c@@ ommission@@ ers .
all c@@ ommission@@ ers are appointed by the president .
the five c@@ ommission@@ ers appointed on recommend@@ ation of the national assembly are based at the head office , while the remain@@ ing members are based in their respective provinces .
the procedure for the appointment of c@@ ommission@@ ers is govern@@ ed by the public service commission act , 1997 , which provides for the regulation of the psc and matters con@@ nec@@ ted with it .
according to the act , a commissioner is appointed for a term of five years , which is renew@@ able for one additional term only .

the requ@@ ester comp@@ lies with all the proced@@ ural requirements in the act relating to the request for access to that record ; and
access to that record is not ref@@ used on any groun@@ d of ref@@ us@@ al mentioned in the act .
how does one request access to a record :
a requ@@ ester must use the form ( form a ) that was published in government ga@@ z@@ ette ( government notice r@@ 18@@ 7 of 15 fe@@ bru@@ ary 2002 ) .
the requ@@ ester must also indic@@ ate if the requ@@ ester wan@@ ts a copy of the record or if the requ@@ ester wan@@ ts to come in and l@@ ook at the record at the offic@@ es of the public body ( srsa ) .
altern@@ ati@@ vely , if the record is not a pap@@ er document , it can then be view@@ ed in the requ@@ ested form , where possible .
if a person ask@@ s for access in a particular form ( e.g. a pap@@ er copy , elec@@ tronic copy , and so for@@ th ) then the requ@@ ester should get access in that form , unless do@@ ing so would inter@@ f@@ ere un@@ reason@@ ably with the r@@ un@@ ning of the public body concerned ( srsa ) , or dam@@ age the record , or inf@@ r@@ inge a cop@@ y@@ right not own@@ ed by the state .
if for practi@@ cal reasons access cannot be given in the required form but in another form , then the fee must be cal@@ cu@@ lated according to the way that the requ@@ ester first asked for it .
if , in addi@@ tion to a written re@@ p@@ ly to their request for the record , the requ@@ ester wan@@ ts to be to@@ ld about the decision in any other way , e.g. telephone , this must be indic@@ ated .
if a requ@@ ester is ask@@ ing for the information on behalf of some@@ body el@@ se , the capacity in which the request is being made must be indic@@ ated .

the information officer must then fill in the form on behalf of such a requ@@ ester and give them a copy of the completed form .
there are two types of fees required to be paid in terms of the act , nam@@ ely ; the request fee and the access fee ( for noti@@ fication of the decision regarding gran@@ ting of access ) .
a requ@@ ester who se@@ eks access to a record contain@@ ing personal information about that requ@@ ester is not required to pay the request fee .
every other requ@@ ester must pay the request fee of r@@ 35 ( pay@@ able to public bo@@ dies ) .
the information officer must noti@@ fy the requ@@ ester ( other than a personal requ@@ ester ) by notice , requi@@ ring the requ@@ ester to pay the prescribed request fee ( if any ) and deposi@@ t ( if any ) before further process@@ ing the request .
the requ@@ ester may lodge an intern@@ al appeal , where appropriate , or an application to the court against the tender or payment of the request fee .
after the information officer has made a decision on the request , the requ@@ ester must be noti@@ fied of such a decision in the way in which the requ@@ ester wan@@ ted to be noti@@ fied .
if the request is granted then a further access fee must be paid for the re@@ production and for search and prepar@@ ation for any time required in exc@@ ess of sti@@ p@@ ula@@ ted hours to search and prepar@@ e the record for dis@@ clo@@ sure .
access to a record will be with@@ held until the requ@@ ester has paid all the applicable fees .

post ex@@ pos@@ ure pro@@ ph@@ y@@ la@@ x@@ is
after a rap@@ e
information to help you take your treatment
what is pe@@ p
post ex@@ pos@@ ure pro@@ ph@@ y@@ la@@ x@@ is ( pe@@ p ) is the p@@ ills that are given to sur@@ vi@@ vor@@ s of sexual ass@@ a@@ ult and rap@@ e to re@@ duce the risk of contrac@@ ting hi@@ v .
sin@@ ce it is diffic@@ ult to establish the hi@@ v status of the att@@ ac@@ kers , the sur@@ vi@@ vor@@ s are treated as through the att@@ ac@@ kers are hi@@ v positive .
this way we can be as@@ su@@ red that all possible prec@@ au@@ tions are taken to re@@ duce the chan@@ ces of hi@@ v infec@@ tion being passed on .
wh@@ y is testing for hi@@ v important after rap@@ e .
testing for hi@@ v is important because the pe@@ p is not necessary if the person is already hi@@ v positive .
if you are hi@@ v positive the staff at the clinic will provide you with information on how to live with hi@@ v .
in most cases a hi@@ v test is done before pe@@ p is star@@ ted .
if the hi@@ v test cannot be done immedi@@ ately , the treatment should start any@@ way and the hi@@ v test c@@ a be done later .
when should the medic@@ ation be star@@ ted
medic@@ ation must be taken within 72 hours after the att@@ ac@@ k , but pre@@ fer@@ ably as soon as possible .
the medic@@ ation is not effective if it is taken after this period .
for how long must the medic@@ ation be taken ?
the medic@@ ation must be taken for 28 days .
this hel@@ ps to de@@ cre@@ ase the risk of be@@ com@@ ing hi@@ v positive .
the full course of 28@@ days must be taken in order for it to work .
the p@@ ills
p@@ ills will be given to you to prevent th@@ ings such as s@@ exually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions and pregn@@ ancy .
the pe@@ p p@@ ills are ho@@ we@@ ver the on@@ es that must be continu@@ ed for 28@@ days .
these pe@@ p p@@ ills must be taken tw@@ ice a day .
most of the time , the clinic will not give you all the p@@ ills for 28 days , therefore you must return to collec@@ t the rest of the p@@ ills .
it is re@@ ally important to come back to collec@@ t the rest of the pe@@ p p@@ ills to complete the course .
the clinic staff will give you a date on which to collec@@ t the pe@@ p p@@ ills .
it is bet@@ s to take the p@@ ills with food and it is recom@@ men@@ ded that you take the p@@ ills at appro@@ xim@@ ately the same time every day .
for example , at 7@@ am when you have bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast and at 7@@ p@@ m when the ne@@ ws start .
many people use their c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es to set up re@@ min@@ ders .
this can be very hel@@ p@@ ful to you .
what about side effec@@ ts .
most medic@@ ine has some side effec@@ ts .
the pe@@ p p@@ ill is str@@ ong and may also have side effec@@ ts .
the three most common side effec@@ ts are na@@ use@@ a , r@@ un@@ ning st@@ om@@ ach and ti@@ red@@ ness .
these become e@@ asi@@ er after the 2@@ n@@ d week .
you will be given anti@@ -@@ na@@ use@@ a medic@@ ation for the first week .
it is also recom@@ men@@ ded that you take the p@@ ill with food .
if the side effec@@ ts per@@ si@@ st return to the clinic and inform the staff .
wh@@ y is it important to take the medic@@ ine ex@@ ac@@ tly as they are prescribed ?
taking the medic@@ ine at the right time and not mis@@ sing any p@@ ills are important to ensure the effecti@@ ven@@ ess of the medic@@ ine .
developing a rou@@ t@@ ine for 28 days is important .
we have developed a time table at the back of this p@@ amp@@ h@@ let to assist you .
put it on your f@@ ri@@ dge or in the b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om .
we are aw@@ are that this is a diffic@@ ult time in your life with having to deal with sexual ass@@ a@@ ult as well as having to take medic@@ ine to prevent possible hi@@ v infec@@ tion .
ask@@ ing a family member or a f@@ ri@@ end to assist you during this period could also be hel@@ p@@ ful .
what do i do if i for@@ get to take the medic@@ ine ?
it is important to take the p@@ ills da@@ ily for 28 days .
even over week@@ ends and situ@@ ations such as visi@@ ting f@@ ri@@ ends et@@ c. if you re@@ ali@@ z@@ e that you have mis@@ sed a do@@ se ; take it as soon as you re@@ member , but if you only re@@ ali@@ z@@ e when taking the next do@@ se , do not take d@@ ou@@ ble do@@ se .
if you have for@@ go@@ t@@ ten to take the p@@ ills for two days or more spe@@ ak to your clinic staff .
wh@@ y must i return to the hospital / clinic ?
it is important that you must return to the clinic / hospital to collec@@ t the rest of the tab@@ l@@ ets and to have your hi@@ v status chec@@ ked .
at this visit they will give you the rest of the pe@@ p tab@@ l@@ ets and will also check how you are cop@@ ing .
you should have another hi@@ v test at 6 weeks ( 2@@ n@@ d return visit ) , after three months and after 6 months .
this is very important to find out your hi@@ v status .
if you test neg@@ ative each time it means that you di@@ d not contract hi@@ v from the rap@@ e .
se@@ ek@@ ing help
rap@@ e is very tra@@ um@@ ati@@ c .
here are some contact numbers :
national telephone numbers :
a@@ ids help line : 0800 012 4@@ 3@@ 22
life line : 021 461 111
local numbers
the p@@ ill di@@ ary
here is an example of a p@@ ill di@@ ary .
this person star@@ ted on a tu@@ es@@ day 12@@ th nov@@ ember and she recor@@ ded this as day 1 and fil@@ led up her di@@ ary .
she also took her first pe@@ p p@@ ill in the mor@@ ning and her second p@@ ill for the 1@@ st day was at 7@@ p@@ m in the even@@ ing .
she will continue to take the p@@ ills at about the same time ever@@ y@@ day for next 28 days until 9 dec@@ ember .
do the same for your p@@ ill di@@ ary .
it is important that you use con@@ d@@ oms for six months .
your pe@@ p di@@ ary .
use this to help you re@@ member to take the p@@ ills
fill in day 1 on the first day you start the p@@ ills .
ti@@ ck off each time that you take the p@@ ill until 28 days of medic@@ ation is complete .
ke@@ ep the di@@ ary in a safe place .

V@@ ari@@ ous offici@@ als from the City of Cape Town, as well as a represent@@ ative from Cape N@@ ature Con@@ serv@@ ation, were also in atten@@ d@@ anc@@ e.
Al@@ th@@ ough the bo@@ tu@@ lis@@ m app@@ ear@@ s to be currently under contro@@ l, the general s@@ enti@@ ment of the me@@ eting was that fishing in the d@@ ams le@@ ads to un@@ necessary injur@@ y to the bir@@ d@@ s.
Bir@@ ds have been str@@ ang@@ led with fishing lin@@ e, and even found with fish hoo@@ ks in their be@@ ak@@ s, are often en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed at these dam@@ s.
The me@@ eting deci@@ ded that the municipality be requ@@ ested not to lif@@ t the mor@@ at@@ ori@@ um on fis@@ h@@ ing, but to sub@@ stitu@@ te it with a total pro@@ hibi@@ tion on fishing in these dam@@ s.
The Directorate City Par@@ ks and N@@ ature Con@@ serv@@ ation considered the request and due to the multi@@ tu@@ de of problems related to fis@@ h@@ ing, agre@@ ed to the im@@ position of a ban on fishing at these dam@@ s.
Th@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ e, no fishing is permit@@ ted at the d@@ ams and notice bo@@ ards to this effect will be er@@ ec@@ ted.
The pres@@ ence of Law En@@ for@@ cement will be increas@@ ed at these d@@ ams to ensure compli@@ anc@@ e.

SO@@ UR@@ C@@ E: E-@@ Innov@@ ation (Department of the Premi@@ er, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
On 17 March 200@@ 5, the Cape Skills e-@@ Lit@@ er@@ acy P@@ il@@ ot Project was initi@@ ated with the sig@@ ning of an agreement between the provincial government and bri@@ d@@ ges@@ .org@@ , an N@@ G@@ O foc@@ using on promo@@ ting the effective use of information and communic@@ ations technology (@@ IC@@ T) in developing countries to improve peop@@ le@@ 's li@@ v@@ es.
"@@ In its iKapa Eli@@ hlumay@@ o strateg@@ y, the provincial government has commit@@ ted it@@ self to building human and social cap@@ it@@ al, with an em@@ ph@@ asis on prepar@@ ing the youth for employ@@ ment.
Wit@@ h this e-@@ liter@@ acy projec@@ t, we are working to address this commit@@ ment in a very practi@@ cal way@@ ,@@ " com@@ ments Dr Har@@ old Wes@@ so@@ , the head of the Centre for e-@@ Innov@@ ation, the provincial government unit in charge of this projec@@ t.
e-@@ Lit@@ er@@ acy loo@@ ks at the com@@ bin@@ ation of compu@@ ter liter@@ acy and information liter@@ ac@@ y.
"@@ This means that we ar@@ en@@ 't j@@ ust loo@@ king at teach@@ ing people how to use compu@@ ters@@ ; we@@ '@@ re also teach@@ ing them how to use IC@@ T@@ s to acc@@ ess, gener@@ ate and evalu@@ ate information and knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ "@@ , says K@@ a@@ ther@@ ine de T@@ ol@@ ly, the project initi@@ ator@@ .
"@@ e-@@ Lit@@ er@@ acy is important because we live in an age where people increas@@ ing@@ ly have to have these skills in order to be able to participate in the econom@@ y@@ .@@ "
If e-@@ liter@@ acy is not addres@@ s@@ ed, the dig@@ ital divi@@ de is wid@@ en@@ ed@@ : those with access and skills benefit from technology and access to information, while those without are increas@@ ing@@ ly mar@@ gin@@ alised (@@ e.g. exclu@@ ded from j@@ ob@@ s, and from participation in government processes and public dis@@ course on the issues that affec@@ t their li@@ v@@ es@@ ).
The Western Cape cannot af@@ ford to i@@ gn@@ ore the im@@ per@@ ative to equi@@ p its citizens with e-@@ liter@@ acy sk@@ ill@@ s@@ ; it fac@@ es the th@@ re@@ at of being le@@ f@@ t further be@@ hin@@ d in the glob@@ al information soci@@ ety if it do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t.
The Cape Skills e-@@ Lit@@ er@@ acy P@@ il@@ ot Project will focus on developing training materials and do@@ ing training at various rural Inter@@ net access poin@@ ts in the Western Cape.

WH@@ O H@@ AND@@ L@@ ES LAND DEVELOPMENT AP@@ P@@ LIC@@ ATION@@ S@@ ?
Local municipalities are responsible for hand@@ ling development applic@@ ations, such as applications for depar@@ tures from building par@@ am@@ et@@ ers or applications for re@@ z@@ on@@ ing or for the sub@@ di@@ vision of land@@ .
Municipali@@ ties decide how to handle these applications according to legisl@@ ation, policies and guidel@@ ines provided by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Plann@@ ing.
In a few inst@@ anc@@ es, for example more comp@@ lic@@ ated re@@ z@@ on@@ ing applic@@ ations, the municipalities will ref@@ er applications to the Department for sub@@ mission to the Minister for a fin@@ al deci@@ sion.
The Department processes agric@@ ulture@@ -@@ related applications for the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture@@ , the national Department of Water Affairs and For@@ estr@@ y, and the Western Cape N@@ ature Con@@ serv@@ ation Bo@@ ar@@ d.
The Department also processes min@@ ing-@@ related applications for the national Department of Min@@ er@@ als and En@@ erg@@ y, the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture@@ , the national Department of Water Affairs and For@@ estr@@ y, and the Western Cape N@@ ature Con@@ serv@@ ation Bo@@ ar@@ d.
HOW ARE AP@@ P@@ LIC@@ ATION@@ S DE@@ CI@@ DE@@ D@@ ?
Be@@ fore a development application can be deci@@ ded in terms of land use planning legisl@@ ation, the application must be sub@@ jec@@ ted to various public participation processes and in some inst@@ anc@@ es, the appro@@ val of various state institutions must also be ob@@ tain@@ ed.
If an application f@@ al@@ ls within a certain category of land change it is also referred to the Depart@@ ment.
Applications are assess@@ ed in terms of the Environmental Con@@ serv@@ ation Act, 198@@ 9 to ensure that integrated environmental policy and planning consider@@ ations are addres@@ s@@ ed.
The Department ens@@ ures that these applications are coordin@@ ated with other related applications nam@@ el@@ y: min@@ ing re@@ por@@ ts, land development applications and sp@@ ati@@ al and strategi@@ c plan@@ s.
Once a development application has been re@@ view@@ ed in terms of environmental legisl@@ ation, an author@@ iz@@ ation, permit or decision - whic@@ he@@ ver is appropriate - is issu@@ ed.
On@@ ly after the application has been re@@ view@@ ed in terms of environmental legislation may a decision in terms of land use legislation be tak@@ en.
AP@@ P@@ E@@ AL@@ S & QU@@ ER@@ IES
Once a decision has been taken by a municipality an appeal against the decision may be lo@@ d@@ ged with the Department for sub@@ mission to the Minister@@ .
If you have a qu@@ er@@ y about a development application you@@ '@@ ve ma@@ de, it must be direc@@ ted to the body to which you made the applic@@ ation.

The Cape Access programme is using both new and existing infrastructure to provide rural communities with access to information technology and the benefits that can be deri@@ ved from th@@ is.
By using existing compu@@ ter centres in local schools and multi@@ -@@ purpose centr@@ es, Cape Access is hel@@ ping communities to get the gre@@ at@@ est benefit from these facili@@ ties.
New compu@@ ter centres have been inst@@ al@@ led in libr@@ aries in communities where there are no facilities or ex@@ tra@@ -@@ facilities are require@@ d.
The pil@@ ot sites situ@@ ated in libr@@ aries are using the S@@ mar@@ t Cape technology developed by the City of Cape Town for the Cape Town libr@@ ary access project (S@@ mar@@ t Cape@@ ).
This provides us@@ ers with the ability to register on@@ lin@@ e, create their own email accoun@@ ts and access the Inter@@ net@@ .
U@@ s@@ ers are li@@ mited to 45 min@@ ute ses@@ sions at any of the five libr@@ ary compu@@ ter@@ s.
The M@@ P@@ C and school sites are using the existing technology at those si@@ t@@ es.
This may be up@@ gra@@ ded in the fu@@ ture to provide us@@ ers with email accoun@@ ts.
e-@@ COM@@ MUNI@@ TY FOR@@ UMS
Each Cape Access site is centre@@ d around an e-@@ Community For@@ um, consist@@ ing of various represent@@ atives from the commun@@ ity, including community lea@@ der@@ s, community N@@ GO@@ s, facility represent@@ atives and inter@@ ested community memb@@ ers.

An en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of time and en@@ ergy has g@@ one into the con@@ soli@@ d@@ ation of these for@@ um@@ s, as research has sho@@ wn that many other tele@@ -@@ centre initi@@ atives have f@@ ailed because they foc@@ uss@@ ed to@@ o much on the tech@@ no@@ logical issues and not en@@ ough on the human issues around accep@@ t@@ ance, training and promo@@ tion.
It is ess@@ enti@@ al that communities pla@@ y a le@@ ading role in defin@@ ing what is required and how the project should oper@@ ate.
Commun@@ ities also need to take responsibility for the sustain@@ ed use of facili@@ ties.
The e-@@ Community For@@ ums will manage access to the facilities as well as other log@@ is@@ tical det@@ ail@@ s.
They are also char@@ ged with mo@@ bi@@ lis@@ ing the community and will pla@@ y a key role in training community memb@@ ers.

The subsi@@ dy will only be granted to individu@@ als who@@ se inform@@ al rights are un@@ cont@@ ested and who are un@@ li@@ kel@@ y to lo@@ se those rights during the current land re@@ form proc@@ ess.

Whi@@ le the subsi@@ dy is called a rural subsi@@ dy it is not li@@ mited to rural areas only and is made available in ur@@ ban areas as well@@ .
This form of subsi@@ dy is regar@@ ded as a subsi@@ dy of last res@@ ort as it is se@@ en as desi@@ r@@ able that sec@@ ure rights of ten@@ ure are provided wh@@ er@@ ever pos@@ si@@ ble.

1. IN@@ TR@@ O@@ D@@ UC@@ TION
When the World Health Organis@@ ation (@@ W@@ HO@@ ) beg@@ an it@@ 's immunis@@ ation programmes in 19@@ 74@@ , less than 5@@ % of the wor@@ l@@ d@@ 's children were immunis@@ ed.
T@@ wen@@ ty@@ -@@ six years la@@ ter, it increas@@ ed to 75@@ % of childr@@ en.
M@@ illi@@ ons up@@ on milli@@ ons of childr@@ en's li@@ ves have been sav@@ ed and the bur@@ den of vacc@@ in@@ e-@@ preven@@ table diseases has been consider@@ ably re@@ duc@@ ed.
Whi@@ le many diseases have dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed from the public e@@ y@@ e, par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically the deb@@ ate about safety of immunis@@ ation is still very much ali@@ v@@ e.
L@@ ac@@ k of public conf@@ id@@ ence in immunis@@ ation programmes has resul@@ ted in a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant dro@@ p in vacc@@ ine cover@@ age levels (@@ in some countries by 25@@ % by the mi@@ d 199@@ 0@@ s@@ ).
G@@ lo@@ b@@ al communic@@ ations, increas@@ ing consum@@ er awar@@ en@@ ess, greater scientific knowledge and more open deb@@ ate about health matters have all contribu@@ ted to greater public s@@ cr@@ ut@@ in@@ y of health@@ care issues and more sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ is@@ m about the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c value of immunis@@ ation.
2. DI@@ SE@@ A@@ SE BUR@@ DE@@ N VER@@ SU@@ S R@@ IS@@ K
Em@@ ph@@ asis on Ad@@ ver@@ se Events F@@ ol@@ low@@ ing Immunis@@ ation (@@ A@@ E@@ FI@@ ) ra@@ ther than li@@ ves sav@@ ed and a ligh@@ ter disease bur@@ den have contribu@@ ted to f@@ an@@ ning emo@@ tional respon@@ ses without necess@@ ar@@ ily bal@@ anc@@ ing the fac@@ ts.
The number of group@@ s that acti@@ vely se@@ ek information and knowledge about the ris@@ ks and benefits of medic@@ in@@ al products has bur@@ ge@@ on@@ ed as one public health cri@@ sis le@@ ads to an@@ oth@@ er.
V@@ acc@@ in@@ e-@@ associ@@ ated adver@@ se events have dra@@ wn public atten@@ tion and cri@@ tic@@ is@@ m.
It app@@ ear@@ s that the public focus has shi@@ f@@ ted from ac@@ ute risk of de@@ ad@@ ly diseases to lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term concer@@ ns about quali@@ ty, safety and eq@@ uit@@ y.
The ris@@ ks of disease and comp@@ lic@@ ations resul@@ ting from with@@ hol@@ ding immunis@@ ation, should be communic@@ ated to parents and commun@@ ities.
Health care workers need also be re@@ min@@ ded of the gre@@ at benefits of immunis@@ ations.
No child should be d@@ eni@@ ed immunis@@ ation without serious th@@ ou@@ ght as to the con@@ sequ@@ enc@@ es, both for the child and the commun@@ ity.
3. V@@ AC@@ C@@ IN@@ E SA@@ FE@@ TY AND QU@@ A@@ LI@@ TY
O@@ ver the year@@ s, the WH@@ O and its part@@ ners have de@@ ploy@@ ed continu@@ ous ef@@ for@@ ts and resources to improve safety of immunis@@ ation.
New delivery tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies including the au@@ to-@@ dis@@ able sy@@ r@@ inge (@@ which does not al@@ low re-@@ use of the sy@@ r@@ inge@@ ) have been intro@@ duc@@ ed.
Each country has a National Cont@@ rol Authority (N@@ C@@ A@@ ) that ass@@ esses the quality of vacc@@ in@@ es, whether loc@@ ally produc@@ ed or im@@ por@@ ted, and ulti@@ m@@ ately author@@ is@@ es or re@@ jects their public us@@ e.
WH@@ O consi@@ ders a vacc@@ ine to be of good quality provided that an independent N@@ C@@ A has controlled the vacc@@ ine in accordance with the requirements defined by the W@@ HO@@ .
There should be no remain@@ ing problems related to the vacc@@ ine quali@@ ty.
All vacc@@ ines used within the national immunis@@ ation programmes s@@ hou@@ l@@ d, as a minim@@ um, meet the WH@@ O quality require@@ ments.
4. E@@ P@@ I@@ (SA@@ ) V@@ AC@@ C@@ IN@@ ES
V@@ acc@@ ines are tes@@ ted for safety and e@@ ffic@@ acy in c@@ lin@@ ical tri@@ als and then in mass tri@@ als before being registered and made available in South Africa.
All vacc@@ ines are evalu@@ ated by the N@@ C@@ A in South Afric@@ a, nam@@ ely the Medi@@ c@@ ines Cont@@ rol Council (@@ M@@ C@@ C) to ensure e@@ ffic@@ ac@@ y, quality and safety pri@@ or to registration and appro@@ val for mark@@ et@@ ing.
All vacc@@ ines used in the E@@ P@@ I@@ (SA@@ ) Programme are manufac@@ tu@@ red according to str@@ ict safety guidel@@ in@@ es.
These vacc@@ ines meet World Health Organis@@ ation (@@ W@@ HO@@ ) standards of quali@@ ty, safety and e@@ ffic@@ ac@@ y.
V@@ acc@@ ine bat@@ ches inten@@ ded for use in the country are tes@@ ted at the National Cont@@ rol Lab@@ or@@ atory (N@@ C@@ L@@ ) in Blo@@ em@@ fontein, pri@@ or to rele@@ as@@ e.
Af@@ ter intro@@ duction into the immunis@@ ation schedule there is on@@ going sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce of safety and e@@ ffic@@ acy through tri@@ als and post marketing sur@@ vei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce by the M@@ C@@ C@@ , E@@ P@@ I Programme and V@@ acc@@ ine Sup@@ p@@ li@@ ers.

The purpose of the E@@ P@@ I system for A@@ EF@@ Is is to
* improve the quality of immunis@@ ation servic@@ es;
* to increase public accep@@ t@@ ance of immunis@@ ation@@ ; and
* to ensure that any such ev@@ ent is hand@@ led in a way that is accep@@ table to the pati@@ ent, the parents and the vacc@@ in@@ ator@@ s.
A@@ EF@@ Is may range from the common red@@ ness and s@@ or@@ eness at the in@@ jec@@ tion si@@ te, to r@@ are, serious conditions such as the potential risk of a se@@ ver@@ e all@@ ergi@@ c re@@ action in 1@@ :@@ 100 000 to 1@@ :@@ 1 000 000 do@@ ses of meas@@ les vacc@@ in@@ e.

5. IM@@ MUNI@@ SA@@ TION SA@@ FE@@ TY PROJEC@@ T
In order to ke@@ ep p@@ ace with new sci@@ ence, new technology and public concer@@ n@@ s, WH@@ O has cre@@ ated the Immunis@@ ation Safety Pri@@ ority Pro@@ jec@@ t, which will focus on@@ :
* ens@@ uring vacc@@ ine safety from c@@ lin@@ ical tri@@ als through the poin@@ t of use
* research and development of saf@@ er and sim@@ pl@@ er vacc@@ ine delivery systems
* exp@@ an@@ ded access to safe and effective delivery tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies and their di@@ spo@@ sal
* identi@@ fication and management of ris@@ ks related to immunis@@ ation
In the he@@ ated deb@@ ates that immunis@@ ation pro@@ vo@@ k@@ es, it is important to consi@@ der the ris@@ k@@ /@@ benefit r@@ ation and to put A@@ EF@@ Is into per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e.
V@@ acc@@ ines are kno@@ wn to be among the saf@@ est and most cost effective health inter@@ ven@@ tions.
Re@@ ports lin@@ king immunis@@ ation to an A@@ EF@@ I that are later pro@@ ven to be a co@@ incid@@ ence and un@@ j@@ usti@@ fied continue to occ@@ ur.
These un@@ f@@ oun@@ ded reports which have not been fully investig@@ ate@@ d, have a potential to do a lo@@ t of har@@ m to the im@@ age of the programme.
Ar@@ gu@@ ments against immunis@@ ation deri@@ ve their power from un@@ j@@ usti@@ fied s@@ car@@ es and mis@@ conc@@ ep@@ tions.
It is important to re@@ member that the R@@ IS@@ K of the DI@@ SE@@ A@@ SE is f@@ ar higher than the R@@ IS@@ K of gi@@ ving the V@@ AC@@ C@@ IN@@ E@@ .
6. RO@@ L@@ ES AND RES@@ P@@ ON@@ SI@@ BI@@ LI@@ TIES
It is the jo@@ int responsibility of govern@@ men@@ ts, regula@@ tory author@@ iti@@ es, the ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ e@@ u@@ tical industr@@ y, health care provi@@ ders and communities to report any un@@ to@@ ward events related to immunis@@ ation.
There is a need to respon@@ d with fac@@ ts and em@@ pa@@ th@@ y to the concer@@ ns of parents and commun@@ ities.
7. CH@@ AL@@ L@@ EN@@ G@@ ES
The appro@@ ach requi@@ res a com@@ bin@@ ation of a car@@ ing at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de towards parents and inf@@ an@@ ts, up to date knowledge and a positive at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de towards immunis@@ ation.
There is no need to be def@@ ensive about immunis@@ ation.
It is a kno@@ wn f@@ act that the vacc@@ in@@ e-@@ preven@@ table diseases are se@@ ver@@ e and immunis@@ ation pre@@ vents them@@ !
New chall@@ eng@@ es in the field of vacc@@ ine development and vacc@@ ine safety lie a@@ he@@ ad@@ .
M@@ ore comple@@ x vacc@@ ines are being developed and tes@@ ted that may require increas@@ ing@@ ly s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated s@@ creening and monitoring syste@@ m@@ s.
At the same ti@@ me, these vacc@@ ines should re@@ duce delivery sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es, si@@ mp@@ lif@@ y delivery tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies and offer good p@@ ric@@ e@@ /@@ benefit r@@ ati@@ os in over@@ all public health term@@ s.
Other than impro@@ ved hou@@ s@@ ing, sanit@@ ation and c@@ le@@ an water sup@@ pl@@ y, vacc@@ ines have had un@@ par@@ all@@ el@@ ed succ@@ ess in re@@ duc@@ ing the incid@@ ence of death and diseas@@ e.
Par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ic@@ al@@ ly, this succ@@ ess may result in an un@@ due em@@ ph@@ asis on vacc@@ ine side effec@@ ts.
R@@ is@@ k communication offers a set of t@@ ools for ex@@ pla@@ ining ris@@ ks in propor@@ tion to benefit@@ s.
When we ref@@ er to the safety of any dr@@ ug@@ , we are t@@ al@@ king about rel@@ ative saf@@ et@@ y, that is safety rel@@ ative to the altern@@ ative of not using vacc@@ in@@ es.
The E@@ P@@ I Programme will continue to work with all part@@ ners to improve all a@@ spec@@ ts of immunis@@ ation, such as vacc@@ ine saf@@ et@@ y, training and work with the industry to improve delivery tech@@ nologi@@ es.
It is by impro@@ ving the quality of health care and ke@@ eping in min@@ d the benefits that preven@@ tive health measures such as immunis@@ ation can off@@ er, that t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w@@ 's world will be a health@@ ier pla@@ ce.
The Department of Health will continue to promote the benefits of immunis@@ ation to all South Afric@@ an@@ s, all health care workers and the health care provi@@ ders.

How Can I B@@ est Help and Support M@@ y Fri@@ end Li@@ ving with HIV/@@ AID@@ S@@ ?
Qu@@ es@@ tion@@ : I am a close f@@ ri@@ end of a person living with HIV/@@ AID@@ S.
How can I best help and support my f@@ ri@@ end and at the same time also deal with the emo@@ tional effect and impact this has on my life and rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps@@ ?
An@@ s@@ wer@@ : A diagno@@ sis of HIV/AIDS affec@@ ts more than j@@ ust the individu@@ al.
It may affec@@ t fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ri@@ ends and even the commun@@ ity.
The diagno@@ sis and the knowledge of living with HIV may be pa@@ inf@@ ul and affec@@ t many areas of lif@@ e: physi@@ cal@@ ly, emo@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, soci@@ al@@ ly, finan@@ cially and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al@@ ly@@ ; it may put ex@@ tr@@ a str@@ ain on individu@@ als and rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
As the support person your '@@ emo@@ tional str@@ ess@@ or@@ s@@ ' may be si@@ mi@@ lar to the person living with HIV@@ / AIDS (@@ PL@@ WH@@ A@@ ).
Fe@@ elings of an@@ ger@@ , f@@ ear@@ , s@@ ad@@ n@@ ess, an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y, hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness and am@@ bi@@ val@@ ence may ar@@ ise and come and go at any time.
These fe@@ elings are nat@@ ur@@ al, but are h@@ ard to deal with@@ .
It is important for you to identi@@ fy and know the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fe@@ eling you have towards your f@@ ri@@ end and find support to deal with it.
In the con@@ text of the your rel@@ ation@@ ship to the PL@@ WH@@ A on a da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day basi@@ s, with@@ dra@@ w@@ al, conflic@@ t, co@@ depend@@ enc@@ y, res@@ ent@@ ment, role changes and se@@ x may become issu@@ es.
In the outside wor@@ l@@ d, fam@@ il@@ y, finan@@ ces and stig@@ ma could im@@ pose ex@@ tr@@ a bur@@ d@@ ens@@ .
It is important to re@@ member that even th@@ ough your needs and fe@@ elings may se@@ em ir@@ relevant com@@ par@@ ed to those of the lo@@ ved on@@ es, they should not take a back se@@ at@@ .
They are of equal wor@@ th to the PL@@ WH@@ A@@ s.
If you do not deal with your own fe@@ elings and ne@@ ed@@ s, they will only mag@@ ni@@ f@@ y, c@@ ause res@@ en@@ tment and many other neg@@ ative and h@@ ard to deal with emo@@ tions.
The best way to handle them is to t@@ alk about them to someone you fe@@ el safe with@@ .
Whi@@ le you may be able to t@@ alk to some of your f@@ ri@@ end@@ s, this is not al@@ ways pos@@ si@@ ble.
Fri@@ ends may not al@@ ways under@@ stand what you are going through@@ .
Al@@ so@@ , you may have been s@@ wor@@ n to sec@@ rec@@ y and not be able to con@@ fi@@ de in your clo@@ s@@ est f@@ ri@@ end@@ s.
A@@ no@@ ther place to t@@ alk through the diffic@@ ulti@@ es, to share your experi@@ ences and find support from the sharing of si@@ mi@@ lar experi@@ ences may be with a support group@@ .
This may be a safe place for ven@@ ting un@@ wan@@ ted and neg@@ ative fe@@ elings for example, res@@ ent@@ ment, g@@ uil@@ t, fe@@ ar or even r@@ age without fe@@ eling g@@ uil@@ ty, and without h@@ ur@@ ting anyone in the proc@@ ess.
A@@ part from providing emo@@ tional sup@@ port, support group@@ s may also be able to help with net@@ work@@ ing, medical or care issu@@ es, financial proble@@ m@@ s, by@@ , for example, star@@ ting a ve@@ ge@@ table g@@ ar@@ den or learning be@@ ad@@ work sk@@ ill@@ s, and child care or par@@ enting sk@@ ill@@ s.
The PL@@ WH@@ A should also be encour@@ aged to jo@@ in a support group for people living with HIV for the same reason@@ s.
For the PL@@ WH@@ A to know that they are sup@@ ported and accep@@ ted is v@@ it@@ al.
Sim@@ p@@ ly by being ther@@ e, li@@ st@@ en@@ ing, ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging conf@@ u@@ sion@@ , t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing, being si@@ l@@ ent, la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing and c@@ ry@@ ing is some@@ times the best that you can do@@ .
As a f@@ ri@@ end@@ , you have the opportun@@ ity for an increas@@ ed s@@ ense of shar@@ ing, increas@@ ed app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of time together and de@@ ep@@ er and more in@@ ti@@ mate and open levels of communication toge@@ th@@ er.

What is MDR TB@@ ?
M@@ ulti@@ -@@ Dr@@ ug Res@@ is@@ tant TB (@@ or MDR T@@ B) is a form of TB caused by bac@@ teri@@ a (@@ ger@@ m@@ s) that are res@@ is@@ tant to the us@@ ual dr@@ ug@@ s used to tre@@ at "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB@@ .
In other word@@ s, the normal dr@@ ug@@ s that we use to tre@@ at "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB will not work.
How many people in the Western Cape Province are affected with MDR TB@@ ?
* The Western Cape Province has rel@@ ati@@ vely low rates of MDR TB, com@@ par@@ ed to other provinces and el@@ se@@ where in the wor@@ l@@ d.
* Of all people who are diagno@@ sed with TB for the first ti@@ me, 1@@ % (@@ 1 in 100@@ ) will have MDR TB, and of all people who are diagno@@ sed with TB after having been treated for TB be@@ for@@ e, 4@@ % (@@ 4 in 100@@ ) will have MDR TB@@ .
* The World Health Org@@ an@@ iz@@ ation (@@ W@@ HO@@ ) ran@@ ks South Africa the 9@@ th country in the world who noti@@ fi@@ es the most number of TB cases every year.
* M@@ ore than 44@@ , 000 people were diagno@@ sed with TB in the Western Cape in 2004,
* This means that alth@@ ough the rates of MDR TB are low in the Provin@@ ce, there is still a lar@@ ge number of people diagno@@ sed with MDR TB in the province each year.
* On a@@ ver@@ age between 4@@ 50 and 600 new cases of MDR TB are diagno@@ sed in the Western Cape an@@ nu@@ al@@ ly.
What ca@@ uses MDR TB@@ ?
MDR TB is caused by the development of TB bac@@ teri@@ a, which have become res@@ is@@ tant to ordinary TB dr@@ ug@@ s.
This occ@@ urs as a result of in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate or ir@@ regula@@ r management of "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB, either by using in@@ appropriate dr@@ ug com@@ bin@@ ations or by using single dr@@ ug@@ s for "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB, clinics r@@ un@@ ning out of dr@@ ug sto@@ ck@@ s, in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate counsel@@ ing of patients le@@ ading to patients not taking their treatment correc@@ tly (@@ poor treatment compli@@ anc@@ e) or patients not retur@@ ning for treatment (@@ de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ting treat@@ ment@@ ).
Can someone develop MDR TB without ever having been infected with "@@ ordinary TB@@ "@@ ?
Mo@@ st MDR TB will develop as a result of poor ad@@ her@@ ence to the treatment for "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB@@ ; ho@@ we@@ ver it is possible for someone who has ne@@ ver had or been treated for TB before to be infected with bac@@ teri@@ a that are already res@@ is@@ tant to ordinary TB dr@@ ug@@ s, if they have had close contact with someone with MDR TB@@ .
Who is at risk of contrac@@ ting MDR TB@@ ?
An@@ y@@ body who is ex@@ posed to someone with MDR TB may be at risk of developing it.
Mo@@ st people who have str@@ ong immun@@ e systems will not develop the diseas@@ e, as their bo@@ d@@ y's immun@@ e system can fi@@ ght the infec@@ tion.
* B@@ ab@@ ies and children under 5 years of age (@@ They will need to have treatment to prevent TB disease if ex@@ posed to someone with T@@ B)
* HIV infected persons
* Mal@@ n@@ ouris@@ hed persons
* Pers@@ ons living in over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds@@ / public institutions like pris@@ ons
* Pers@@ ons who@@ se immun@@ e systems are not str@@ ong due to other diseases e.g. Di@@ a@@ be@@ tes Mel@@ li@@ t@@ us, cancer and some medi@@ cations
* Pers@@ ons with sub@@ stance abuse problems e.g. al@@ co@@ ho@@ lis@@ m or dr@@ ug abus@@ e.
Is it e@@ asi@@ er to get MDR TB@@ ?
There is no evidence to su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that it is e@@ asi@@ er to get MDR TB than ordinary TB@@ .
TB of the l@@ un@@ gs is rel@@ ati@@ vely more infec@@ ti@@ ous than TB affec@@ ting other organ@@ s@@ / systems of the bo@@ d@@ y, as the bac@@ teri@@ a may be ex@@ cre@@ ted and spread by air@@ -@@ bor@@ ne dro@@ pl@@ et@@ s.
What are the symptoms (@@ complain@@ ts@@ ) of persons with MDR TB@@ ?
â@@ ¢ The symptoms are the same as for "@@ ordin@@ ary@@ " TB
â@@ ¢ A per@@ si@@ st@@ ent c@@ ough for longer than 2 week@@ s.
â@@ ¢ The c@@ ough may be productive and bl@@ ood stain@@ ed, ch@@ est pa@@ in, lo@@ ss of weight and lo@@ ss of appe@@ ti@@ te and ni@@ ght swe@@ at@@ s.
How is MDR TB diagno@@ s@@ ed@@ ?
Once a person pres@@ ents with symptoms of TB, or is found to be a close contact of some@@ body with TB, clinic staff will request the person to provide two sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m (@@ spit@@ ) speci@@ mens (@@ ph@@ leg@@ m from c@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing@@ ), which will be sent to the labor@@ atory for testing under a micro@@ s@@ cop@@ e.
In addi@@ tion to the normal tes@@ ts done for TB, additional tes@@ ts called culture and s@@ ensi@@ tiv@@ ity test@@ ing, are done on the sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m speci@@ mens of people suspec@@ ted of having MDR TB@@ .
These speci@@ ali@@ z@@ ed tes@@ ts take three to four weeks to re@@ ve@@ al growth of the res@@ is@@ tant TB b@@ aci@@ lli@@ , and to see which dr@@ ug@@ s will work against the bac@@ teri@@ a.
In addi@@ tion, ch@@ est X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys may be done in certain circum@@ stan@@ ces to see the extent of any l@@ un@@ g dam@@ age and for fu@@ ture monitoring of respon@@ se to treat@@ ment.
Can patients with MDR TB be treated and c@@ ure@@ d@@ ?
MDR TB is more diffic@@ ult to tre@@ at than ordinary TB, because the TB b@@ aci@@ ll@@ i are res@@ is@@ tant to the dr@@ ug@@ s used to tre@@ at ordinary TB@@ .
"@@ Sec@@ ond lin@@ e@@ " TB dr@@ ug@@ s are us@@ ed, which are less effective and have more side effec@@ ts.
Treatment out@@ comes are not as good as those with dr@@ ug s@@ ensi@@ tive TB, part@@ ly because MDR TB ten@@ ds to occ@@ urs in people with exten@@ sive l@@ un@@ g dam@@ age who have been on and off TB treatment a long time.
If diagno@@ sed early the chan@@ ces of c@@ ure are much bet@@ ter.
On a@@ ver@@ age@@ , less than 50@@ % of people with MDR TB will be c@@ ure@@ d, and about 30@@ % will die before com@@ pl@@ eting treat@@ ment.
How is MDR TB tre@@ ate@@ d@@ ?
P@@ ati@@ ents with MDR TB will have to take at least 5 different dr@@ ug@@ s, including a da@@ ily in@@ jec@@ tion for 4 months 5 days a week@@ .
D@@ uring this time most patients with MDR TB are ad@@ mitted to hospital so that they can be clo@@ sel@@ y monit@@ or@@ ed for ad@@ her@@ ence to treatment and to monitor any side effec@@ ts.
Th@@ er@@ e@@ after patients will need to take at least 3 different dr@@ ug@@ s for a further 12 â 16 months 5 days a week@@ .
Th@@ us, treatment is much longer than for "@@ ordinary TB@@ " (@@ which takes between 6 to 8 month@@ s@@ ), and can go on for up to 2 years.
The l@@ eng@@ th of treatment is to ensure that the disease does not rela@@ ps@@ e.
How can the spread of TB be preven@@ ted (@@ including MDR TB@@ )@@ ?
When c@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing or s@@ nee@@ z@@ ing, any person and especially those with TB or MDR TB should co@@ ver the no@@ se and m@@ outh with a ti@@ s@@ su@@ e to prevent air@@ -@@ bor@@ ne spread of the b@@ aci@@ lli@@ .
P@@ ati@@ ents should also a@@ vo@@ id spit@@ ting into open air@@ / the groun@@ d.
G@@ ood ven@@ ti@@ l@@ ation of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds is str@@ ong@@ ly recom@@ men@@ de@@ d, people are encour@@ aged to ke@@ ep all win@@ do@@ ws and d@@ oor@@ s op@@ en.
If possible li@@ mit pro@@ lon@@ ged contact (@@ includes a@@ vo@@ iding sharing the bed@@ ro@@ om at ni@@ gh@@ t) with persons with ordinary TB or MDR TB, while their sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m remain@@ s positive with TB or MDR TB b@@ aci@@ lli@@ .
Can a person with MDR TB continue to work@@ , and if no@@ t, are they e@@ lig@@ i@@ ble for a dis@@ ability gran@@ t@@ ?
When the patient is taking treatment regul@@ arly and once the sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m has been tes@@ ted and sho@@ ws that they are no longer ex@@ cre@@ ting MDR TB b@@ aci@@ lli@@ , the person can res@@ um@@ e work@@ ing.
If the patient is assess@@ ed and declared to be "@@ physi@@ cally inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ ate@@ d@@ " by a medical doc@@ tor@@ , they may apply for a temporary dis@@ ability gran@@ t.
Is there a lin@@ k between HIV/AIDS and MDR TB@@ ?
Inf@@ ec@@ tion with TB also increas@@ es illness and progres@@ sion (@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty@@ ) of HIV@@ , including increas@@ ing the death rate (@@ mor@@ ta@@ li@@ ty@@ ) in HIV infected peop@@ le.
Th@@ us it is ex@@ tre@@ mel@@ y important for TB to be preven@@ ted and/or de@@ tec@@ ted and treated as early as possible in HIV infected peop@@ le.
It is important to re@@ member that even if someone is HIV positive TB can be treated and c@@ ure@@ d@@ !
Can an HIV infected person or person living with AIDS take both MDR TB and An@@ ti@@ retrovir@@ al treatment at the same ti@@ me@@ ?
The two treat@@ ments may be taken con@@ curr@@ ent@@ ly.
Clo@@ se monitoring by an experi@@ enc@@ ed medical doctor is necessary for patients on both ther@@ ap@@ i@@ es.
What is me@@ ant by an "@@ out@@ bre@@ ak@@ " of MDR TB@@ ?
By defin@@ i@@ tion any disease out@@ bre@@ ak is the occ@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of more cases of the particular condi@@ tion than would norm@@ ally be exp@@ ected in the particular circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
The disease cases must be ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ o@@ log@@ ically lin@@ ked (@@ that means that medical staff are able to establish defin@@ i@@ te lin@@ ks between the cas@@ es@@ ), as op@@ posed to occ@@ ur@@ ring by co@@ incid@@ ence.
In the case of an out@@ bre@@ ak of MDR TB, how is further spread of the infec@@ tion preven@@ te@@ d@@ ?
Once an MDR TB case is suspec@@ ted, ac@@ tive case fin@@ ding is under@@ tak@@ en, i.@@ e. we acti@@ vely l@@ ook for all persons who may have contrac@@ ted the infec@@ tion before they present ill to health facili@@ ties.
This is done to li@@ mit the potential spread of the infec@@ tion by as y@@ et un@@ diagno@@ sed person@@ s.
S@@ pu@@ tu@@ m tes@@ ts for MDR TB are done and appropriate treatment is offered to confir@@ med cas@@ es.
At the same ti@@ me, these persons should be removed from the community until they have received treatment and are no longer infec@@ ti@@ ou@@ s.

E@@ arly De@@ tec@@ tion is the K@@ ey to Sur@@ vi@@ ve Bre@@ ast Cancer
18 October 2005
The incid@@ ence of bre@@ ast cancer among South African women is increas@@ ing, with more than 3 8@@ 00 cases being diagno@@ sed every year@@ , says Provincial Health Minister@@ , Pierre U@@ ys.
In a state@@ ment in support of National Bre@@ ast Cancer A@@ war@@ eness Mon@@ th, Uys says bre@@ ast cancer is one of the most common canc@@ ers among women in this countr@@ y.
Ab@@ out 90@@ % of patients sur@@ vi@@ ve for many years after diagno@@ sis when bre@@ ast cancer is de@@ tec@@ ted at the early st@@ ag@@ es.
The design@@ ation of October as "@@ W@@ o@@ men@@ 's Health and Bre@@ ast Cancer A@@ war@@ eness Mon@@ th@@ " in South Africa reflec@@ ts a nation@@ wi@@ de dri@@ ve by public and private health@@ care structures to ra@@ ise awareness of this de@@ bi@@ li@@ t@@ ating diseas@@ e.
R@@ is@@ k fac@@ tors for f@@ em@@ ale bre@@ ast cancer include early men@@ ar@@ ch@@ e (@@ perio@@ d@@ ), late age at first child@@ bir@@ th, a high@@ -@@ f@@ at di@@ et and certain gene@@ tic mu@@ t@@ ations.
Other su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted risk fac@@ tors inclu@@ de, to a l@@ ess@@ er exten@@ d, high al@@ cohol consum@@ p@@ tion, contrac@@ ep@@ tives use and the use of certain post@@ -@@ men@@ op@@ a@@ us@@ al hor@@ m@@ one replacement ther@@ ap@@ i@@ es.
The risk of developing bre@@ ast cancer among South African women (@@ aged 0@@ -@@ 74 y@@ r@@ s) is 1 in 31 f@@ em@@ al@@ es.
Uys says health services the world over have come a long way in fi@@ gh@@ ting this dre@@ a@@ ded diseas@@ e.
"@@ Treatment is, ho@@ wever, exp@@ ensive and every new facility this province gets to help us in our fi@@ ght against cancer is wel@@ com@@ ed.
We have a new C@@ T s@@ can@@ ner at Groote Schuur Hospital and in@@ jec@@ ted an ex@@ tr@@ a R1 million for the treatment of main@@ ly head and bre@@ ast canc@@ ers.
"@@ We do this because cancer patients often still have many fr@@ uit@@ ful years a@@ head with special treat@@ ment.
We in the Western Cape are for@@ t@@ un@@ ate that we do have exc@@ ell@@ ent cancer treatment facilities throughout the provin@@ ce, but if there is no early de@@ tec@@ tion through regula@@ r examin@@ ation, sur@@ vi@@ val chan@@ ces are dr@@ as@@ tic@@ ally re@@ duc@@ ed@@ ,@@ " says U@@ ys.

A verb@@ al agreement is as bin@@ ding as a written le@@ as@@ e.
However, if a written lease is required for you to occ@@ up@@ y premis@@ es and you ref@@ use to sign it, there is no agreement and you can@@ 't leg@@ ally mo@@ ve into the proper@@ ty.
If you have ren@@ ted a property on a verb@@ al basis for some time and your landlord then ask@@ s you to sign a le@@ as@@ e, you do not have to sign a lease with terms that are different to your verb@@ al agree@@ ment.
R@@ ath@@ er, the landlord will have to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate new terms with you and sec@@ ure your agreement fir@@ st@@ .
R@@ em@@ em@@ ber@@ , it is al@@ ways better for both of you to have your agreement in writ@@ ing, s@@ etting out the terms and conditions of your agree@@ ment.
This will go a long way to preven@@ ting later disp@@ ut@@ es.

* Your name

* The amount for which you will r@@ ent it
* The amount by which the r@@ ent will increase (for example, by 10 per@@ cent when renew@@ ing the le@@ as@@ e)
* When the r@@ ent will increase (for example, if there is a rates increas@@ e)
* How often r@@ ent is to be paid (for example, month@@ ly@@ )
* The amount of the deposi@@ t, if any

* The conditions under which either you or your landlord can give notice to canc@@ el the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not don@@ e, or if the tenant is in ar@@ re@@ ars with the r@@ ent@@ )
* The Hou@@ se r@@ ul@@ es, signed by both of you@@ , should be att@@ ached to the le@@ as@@ e.
* A list of def@@ ec@@ ts, dra@@ wn up at a jo@@ int inspec@@ tion when you mo@@ ve in and signed by both of you@@ , must also be att@@ ached to the le@@ as@@ e.
M@@ US@@ T I PA@@ Y A DE@@ PO@@ SI@@ T@@ ?
Y@@ es, if the landlord ask@@ s for one and it is sti@@ p@@ ula@@ ted in the le@@ as@@ e.
If the terms of your origin@@ al agree@@ ment, whether or@@ al or writ@@ ten@@ , di@@ d not include a deposi@@ t, you need not pay one if the landlord ask@@ s you to do so la@@ ter.
C@@ han@@ ges to an agreement are only valid if both you and your landlord ag@@ ree to it.
WHAT H@@ AP@@ P@@ EN@@ S TO MY DE@@ PO@@ SI@@ T W@@ HI@@ LE I@@ '@@ M LI@@ V@@ ING ON THE PRO@@ PER@@ T@@ Y@@ ?
The landlord or his ag@@ ent must ke@@ ep your deposi@@ t in an inter@@ est@@ -@@ be@@ aring account (@@ or trust accoun@@ t, in the case of an agent@@ ) for the time you are living on the proper@@ ty.
The full deposi@@ t am@@ oun@@ t, plus the interest ear@@ n@@ ed, must then be retur@@ ned to you when you mo@@ ve out less the costs of dam@@ ages caused by you and any mon@@ ies you may still o@@ we to the landlord in terms of the le@@ as@@ e.
WHAT MA@@ IN@@ TEN@@ AN@@ CE M@@ US@@ T THE LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D DO@@ ?
It depend@@ s on what your lease sa@@ ys.

Lo@@ dge a complaint with the R@@ ental Housing Tribun@@ al.
CAN MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D EN@@ TER THE PRO@@ PER@@ TY WI@@ TH@@ OU@@ T MY PER@@ MIS@@ SI@@ ON@@ ?
Your landlord has a right to enter the property to perform rou@@ t@@ ine inspec@@ tions and so on, but only after let@@ ting you know well in adv@@ ance to ar@@ range a time that s@@ uit@@ s you.
You do not have the right to den@@ y him reasonable acc@@ ess.
CAN MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D IN@@ C@@ RE@@ A@@ SE MY R@@ EN@@ T WH@@ EN H@@ E W@@ AN@@ TS TO@@ ?
No@@ , the lease or verb@@ al agreement determin@@ es wh@@ en, and by how mu@@ ch, your r@@ ent can be increas@@ ed.
If the agreement does not speci@@ fy an amount or date for an increas@@ e, the landlord has to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate the increase with you.
N@@ either you n@@ or your landlord can make changes to your origin@@ al agreement without chec@@ king with the other party fir@@ st@@ .
B@@ Y HOW M@@ UC@@ H CAN MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D IN@@ C@@ RE@@ A@@ SE MY R@@ EN@@ T WH@@ EN I R@@ EN@@ E@@ W THE LE@@ A@@ SE@@ ?
This is specific to the renew@@ al terms of your agree@@ ment.
If your agreement do@@ es@@ n@@ 't speci@@ fy a reasonable es@@ cal@@ ation, your landlord has to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate an accep@@ table r@@ ent with you.
WHAT CAN I DO I@@ F MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D SA@@ Y@@ S I HA@@ V@@ EN@@ '@@ T PA@@ ID THE R@@ EN@@ T WH@@ EN I HA@@ VE@@ ?
It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord recei@@ ves the ren@@ t, so it will be up to you to provide proof of payment (for example, a bank@@ -@@ deposi@@ t s@@ li@@ p@@ ).
If you can@@ '@@ t, your landlord will be able to give you notice in terms of your agreement and se@@ ek a court order for ev@@ ic@@ tion.
It is your righ@@ t, in terms of the R@@ ental Housing Act (@@ Act 50 of 199@@ 9@@ ), to in@@ si@@ st on a recei@@ pt for all pay@@ ments if your landlord does not automati@@ cally supp@@ ly you with on@@ e.
A recei@@ pt must cont@@ ain the following inform@@ ation:
* The date of issue
* The address of the property for which the payment is made
* The reas@@ on for the payment (@@ whether it@@ 's r@@ ent@@ al, ar@@ re@@ ars or a deposi@@ t)

If your landlord takes your pos@@ ses@@ sions without a court or@@ der, it@@ 's th@@ ef@@ t and you should contact the South African Police and lodge a complaint with the R@@ ental Housing Tribun@@ al.
HOW CAN I EN@@ D MY LE@@ A@@ SE E@@ AR@@ L@@ Y@@ ?
It depend@@ s on the canc@@ ell@@ ation cla@@ use in your agree@@ ment.
If there is no such cla@@ us@@ e, the only way you can end your lease early without being in bre@@ ach of contract is if your landlord agre@@ es to it or if your landlord is in material bre@@ ach of the lease (for example, by f@@ ail@@ ing to maintain the outside of the proper@@ ty, as agre@@ ed in the contrac@@ t, and this mak@@ es it im@@ possible for you to remain on the proper@@ ty.
B@@ ut you will have to pro@@ ve th@@ is, th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ).
If your landlord has met all the conditions of the le@@ as@@ e, you can still end the lease early but will y@@ our@@ self be in bre@@ ach of contrac@@ t.
This means your landlord can de@@ m@@ and the bal@@ ance due by you for the rest of the lease perio@@ d, and you may lo@@ se your deposi@@ t.
Spe@@ ak to your landlord before making a mo@@ v@@ e: many are wil@@ ling to al@@ low sub@@ let@@ ting or to termin@@ ate a lease after a s@@ uitable notice period on condi@@ tion that you find a s@@ uitable replacement ten@@ an@@ t.
If your landlord agre@@ es to termin@@ ate a contract pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly, be sure to get it in writ@@ ing, out@@ lin@@ ing the terms and conditions of the termin@@ ation.

Ch@@ eck your previous lease for a renew@@ al cla@@ use that out@@ lin@@ es how much notice you must give in such a situ@@ ation.
If there is no such cla@@ us@@ e, then the two of you ha@@ v@@ e, through your ac@@ tions, effecti@@ vely renew@@ ed the previous le@@ as@@ e, on the same terms and condi@@ tions, and for the full period st@@ ated in the origin@@ al agree@@ ment.
This means that you will have to in@@ vo@@ ke the canc@@ ell@@ ation cla@@ use of the origin@@ al le@@ as@@ e, if there is on@@ e, in order to get out of the agree@@ ment.
W@@ i@@ th@@ out a canc@@ ell@@ ation cla@@ us@@ e, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your landlord one month@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, in writ@@ ing, before the lease expi@@ re@@ d. (S@@ o if you were ne@@ aring the end of a 12@@ -@@ month le@@ as@@ e, you should have let your landlord kno@@ w@@ , in writ@@ ing, at the end of the ele@@ ven@@ th month@@ .@@ )
CAN MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D LOC@@ K ME OU@@ T@@ ?
No. Your landlord must give you a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate key immedi@@ ately if he changes the loc@@ ks due to we@@ ar and te@@ ar or some other reasonable ca@@ us@@ e.
CAN MY LAND@@ L@@ OR@@ D RE@@ F@@ US@@ E TO RE@@ TUR@@ N MY DE@@ PO@@ SI@@ T@@ ?

If your landlord re@@ tain@@ s your deposi@@ t and is unable to fur@@ nis@@ h you with proof of the costs he has inc@@ ur@@ re@@ d, you should lodge a complaint with the R@@ ental Housing Tribun@@ al.
To prevent th@@ is, be sure to fol@@ low these ste@@ p@@ s:
* When you mo@@ ve in, inspec@@ t the property together and li@@ st@@ , in writ@@ ing, any existing def@@ ec@@ ts.
Bo@@ th of you should sign this document and it must be att@@ ached to the lease agree@@ ment.
* When you mo@@ ve ou@@ t, inspec@@ t the property together again@@ .
Com@@ par@@ e the new list of def@@ ec@@ ts with the list made ear@@ li@@ er.
* You may be given a ch@@ ance to re@@ pai@@ r the dam@@ age y@@ our@@ self@@ , or you can ag@@ ree that the landlord will do it.
If the landlord does the re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s, you have the right to see all recei@@ p@@ ts for re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s paid for out of the deposi@@ t.
* If re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s cost less than the deposi@@ t plus the interest acc@@ r@@ u@@ ed, your landlord will have to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se you the differ@@ ence.

A verb@@ al agreement is as bin@@ ding as a written le@@ as@@ e, but if your tenant in@@ si@@ sts on having s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing in writ@@ ing, you must com@@ pl@@ y.
It is, ho@@ wever, better for both of you to have your agreement in writing to set out the terms and conditions agre@@ ed up@@ on.
This will go a long way to preven@@ ting later disp@@ ut@@ es, when it is your word against your ten@@ ant@@ '@@ s.
* Your ten@@ ant@@ 's name
* Your ten@@ ant@@ 's postal address
* The amount for which you will r@@ ent it out
* How often r@@ ent is to be pa@@ id@@ , (for example, month@@ ly@@ )
* Your and your ten@@ ant@@ 's oblig@@ ations (for example, who is responsible for main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e?
U@@ su@@ al@@ ly, the tenant pa@@ ys for char@@ ges related to consum@@ p@@ tion, such as water and elec@@ tric@@ ity, and the landlord pa@@ ys for char@@ ges related to the proper@@ ty, such as r@@ at@@ es@@ .@@ )
* The conditions under which either you or your tenant can give notice to canc@@ el the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not don@@ e, or if the tenant is in ar@@ re@@ ars with the r@@ ent@@ )
* The Hou@@ se r@@ ul@@ es, signed by both parti@@ es, should be att@@ ached to the le@@ as@@ e.
HOW DO I C@@ HE@@ C@@ K A PO@@ TEN@@ TI@@ AL TEN@@ AN@@ T@@ 'S B@@ AC@@ K@@ GR@@ O@@ UN@@ D@@ ?
Spe@@ ak to the ten@@ ant@@ 's current landlord for a refer@@ ence.
I@@ t@@ 's also a good ide@@ a to spe@@ ak to previous land@@ l@@ ord@@ s, as the current landlord may give a good reference as a way to get ri@@ d of an un@@ wan@@ ted ten@@ an@@ t, and to get a letter from your ten@@ ant@@ 's employer to veri@@ fy his permanent position and in@@ com@@ e.

R@@ em@@ ember that the deposi@@ t must be put in an inter@@ est@@ -@@ be@@ aring account for the d@@ ur@@ ation of the lease and given back to your ten@@ an@@ t, plus the interest it has ear@@ n@@ ed, when the tenant mo@@ ves ou@@ t.
I@@ f, ho@@ wever, your tenant still ow@@ es you money on mo@@ ving ou@@ t, or if the property has been dam@@ aged be@@ y@@ ond normal we@@ ar and te@@ ar@@ , you can use the deposi@@ t to pay for re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s or to co@@ ver the money ow@@ ed to you.

It depend@@ s on what it says in your contrac@@ t.
If your contract do@@ es@@ n@@ 't speci@@ fy a reasonable es@@ cal@@ ation, you will have to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate an accep@@ table r@@ ent with the ten@@ an@@ t.
WHAT CAN I DO I@@ F MY TEN@@ AN@@ T HA@@ S NO@@ T PA@@ ID THE R@@ EN@@ T ON TI@@ ME@@ ?
Tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al@@ ly, your tenant is in bre@@ ach of contrac@@ t.
Ref@@ er to the bre@@ ach cla@@ use of your contract (@@ or, in the case of a verb@@ al agree@@ ment, the agre@@ ed on terms for termin@@ ation) and act on it.
If you don@@ 't have a canc@@ ell@@ ation agree@@ ment, it is good practice to w@@ ri@@ te a letter gi@@ ving your tenant se@@ ven days to pa@@ y, f@@ ail@@ ing which you will canc@@ el the le@@ as@@ e.

It is your ten@@ ant@@ 's responsibility to make sure that you receive the ren@@ t, so your tenant will have to s@@ how you proof of payment (for example, a bank@@ -@@ deposi@@ t s@@ li@@ p@@ ).
If your tenant can@@ 't do so@@ , you can give your tenant notice in terms of your agreement and se@@ ek a court order for ev@@ ic@@ tion.
If you are s@@ ati@@ s@@ fied that payment h@@ as@@ , in@@ de@@ ed, been ma@@ de, you are then o@@ bli@@ ged in terms of the R@@ ental Housing Act (@@ Act 50 of 199@@ 9@@ ) to provide you tenant with a recei@@ p@@ t.

You will have to ob@@ tain a court order fir@@ st@@ .
The Sher@@ if@@ f of the Court will then att@@ ach your ten@@ ant@@ 's property to the amount of the money due to you.

W@@ i@@ th@@ out a canc@@ ell@@ ation cla@@ us@@ e, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your tenant one month@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, in writ@@ ing, before the lease expi@@ re@@ d.

HOW DO I E@@ V@@ ICT MY TEN@@ AN@@ T@@ ?
You can ne@@ ver ev@@ ict a tenant y@@ our@@ self@@ .
You can only se@@ ek a court order to ev@@ ict a tenant if your tenant is in bre@@ ach of contrac@@ t.
To find out if your tenant is in bre@@ ach of contrac@@ t, check your agree@@ ment.
There should be a cla@@ use sa@@ ying what constitu@@ tes a bre@@ ach of contract (for example, not pay@@ ing the r@@ ent on ti@@ me@@ ) and what your rights would be in such a case (@@ in other word@@ s, canc@@ el the lease without further noti@@ ce@@ ).
If your tenant is in@@ de@@ ed in bre@@ ach of contrac@@ t, take ste@@ ps to str@@ ong@@ ly ur@@ ge your tenant to rec@@ ti@@ fy the bre@@ ach@@ .
If this does not work@@ , take legal action - lodge a complaint with the R@@ ental Housing Tribun@@ al or se@@ ek the help of a compet@@ ent at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y.
CAN I EN@@ TER THE PRO@@ PER@@ TY WI@@ TH@@ OU@@ T MY TEN@@ AN@@ T@@ 'S PER@@ MIS@@ SI@@ ON@@ ?
You have a right to enter the property to perform rou@@ t@@ ine inspec@@ tions and so on, but only after arran@@ ging with your tenant to do so at a reasonable ti@@ me, and with reasonable no@@ tic@@ e.
Your tenant does not have the right to den@@ y you reasonable acc@@ ess.
CAN I CH@@ AN@@ G@@ E THE LOC@@ K@@ S AND LOC@@ K MY TEN@@ AN@@ T OU@@ T@@ ?

Report your su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ons to South African Police Servic@@ es.
It is also a good ide@@ a to ad@@ d a cla@@ use to your lease st@@ ating that no il@@ legal activities are to be conduc@@ ted on the proper@@ ty, which would give you groun@@ ds to canc@@ el the lease immedi@@ ate@@ ly.

You therefore need to di@@ al different numbers for different government emergency servic@@ es, unless you are in the City of Cape Town metro@@ politan are@@ a, which already has its own single emergency number (@@ 10@@ 7@@ ).
For an emergency that needs police respon@@ se, you should di@@ al 101@@ 11@@ .
For an emergency that requi@@ res an amb@@ ul@@ ance, you should di@@ al 101@@ 7@@ 7.
For both of these you must be able to sa@@ y where you are and wh@@ y you need the emergency respon@@ se.
Bo@@ th of these numbers can be di@@ al@@ led for fre@@ e.
In the City of Cape Town metro@@ politan are@@ a, you can di@@ al 10@@ 7 (@@ at no cost from a land@@ line or public ph@@ on@@ e) for AN@@ Y emergency or dis@@ as@@ ter.
You must state the nature of the emergency (@@ fire@@ , m@@ oun@@ tain res@@ cu@@ e, traffic accid@@ ent, cri@@ me, et@@ c@@ .@@ ) and the oper@@ ator will ensure that the right emergency respon@@ se hel@@ ps you.
You should also be able to state where the emergency is.
Di@@ al@@ ling 10@@ 7 from a c@@ ell phone won@@ 't work.
To di@@ al the Cape Town single emergency number from a c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ e, di@@ al 021 48@@ 0 77@@ 00@@ .

However, if you are cal@@ ling from a c@@ ell phone you can di@@ al 11@@ 2 and you will be lin@@ ked to your c@@ ell phone compan@@ y's emergency call centre@@ .
A call to 11@@ 2 on a c@@ ell phone is free and is even possible on a c@@ ell phone that does not have air@@ time (@@ it should also be possible even if you don@@ 't have a SI@@ M car@@ d@@ ).
Emergency cal@@ ls take pri@@ ority and if the net@@ work is b@@ us@@ y, other cal@@ ls will be dro@@ p@@ p@@ ed to take your emergency c@@ all@@ .
The net@@ works must@@ , in terms of their lic@@ enc@@ es, provide this access to five emergency services (@@ fire@@ , amb@@ ul@@ ance, polic@@ e, se@@ a res@@ cu@@ e and tr@@ aff@@ ic@@ ).
The c@@ ell phone net@@ works also have different special emergency services that you can di@@ al in addi@@ tion to 11@@ 2 or as part of 11@@ 2 di@@ all@@ ing.

These can be serious cri@@ m@@ es, traffic off@@ enc@@ es, and local by@@ -@@ laws within the City of Cape Town.
However, they do not investigate cases after arres@@ ts, as this is the function of the De@@ tec@@ tive Service of the South African Police Service (@@ SAP@@ S@@ ).
They share traffic polic@@ ing functions with the Provincial Traffic Servic@@ e.
The C@@ T@@ C@@ P can be di@@ st@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed from SAP@@ S (@@ who we@@ ar b@@ lu@@ e uni@@ form@@ s) and traffic officers (@@ who we@@ ar light b@@ lu@@ e uni@@ form@@ s) by their bla@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ wh@@ i@@ te uni@@ forms with bla@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ wh@@ i@@ te check det@@ ail@@ .
Th@@ eir car@@ s and motor@@ c@@ yc@@ les are also mark@@ ed with the bla@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ wh@@ i@@ te check det@@ ail@@ .
The C@@ T@@ C@@ P was established on 1 December 2001 in terms of the South African Police Services A@@ mend@@ ment Act 199@@ 8.
In other ci@@ ties, such as Dur@@ ban and Johann@@ esburg, the traffic services immedi@@ ately bec@@ ame part of their c@@ ity police services.
In Cape Town, this is going to happ@@ en s@@ low@@ ly and most traffic officers will become c@@ ity police con@@ st@@ ab@@ les by 201@@ 0@@ .
E@@ ver@@ yone who jo@@ ins the C@@ T@@ C@@ P has to have special training at the Municipal Police Training Col@@ lege in P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ i before be@@ com@@ ing a c@@ ity police con@@ st@@ ab@@ le.
There is a committee called the Civi@@ li@@ an Over@@ si@@ ght Comm@@ itte@@ e, which is responsible for making sure the C@@ T@@ C@@ P operates proper@@ ly.
They also adv@@ ise the head of the C@@ T@@ C@@ P about h@@ is@@ /@@ her du@@ ties, and evalu@@ ate the performance of the C@@ T@@ C@@ P@@ .
The Committee is made up of se@@ ven City Counci@@ l@@ lor@@ s and se@@ ven ordinary civi@@ li@@ an@@ s.
The C@@ T@@ C@@ P have offic@@ es all over the c@@ ity.
They have two main offic@@ es, one in Cape Town and one in Mitchell's Pla@@ in, with Mitchell's Plain office being the only 24@@ -@@ h@@ our office.

14 u@@ Nov@@ emb@@ a 2005
The sum@@ mer is up@@ on us and with the he@@ at comes Di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ al Dis@@ e@@ as@@ e, said Minister Uys to@@ day during a visit to Mitchell's Plain Community Health Centre@@ .
Minister Uys said the Western Cape Department of Health will com@@ bat@@ diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ al disease and increase immun@@ iz@@ ation in the province as part of its@@ 2005 Chris@@ t@@ m@@ as De@@ li@@ ver@@ ab@@ les c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ .
The disease pe@@ ak@@ s during Febru@@ ary@@ and Mar@@ ch@@ .
Di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ al disease is especially pre@@ val@@ ent in sum@@ mer because of more f@@ lies and higher water infec@@ tion.
The high@@ est incid@@ ence occ@@ urs in low income areas and especially in the inform@@ al sett@@ le@@ ments.
Minister Uys said children under the age of two are especially vul@@ ner@@ able and mo@@ thers need to was@@ h their hand@@ s regul@@ ar@@ ly.
The Department will com@@ b@@ at the th@@ reat@@ ening diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ al disease through the employment of 74 commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based workers train@@ ed in the In@@ tegr@@ ate@@ d@@ Management of Chil@@ d@@ hood I@@ ll@@ nesses (I@@ M@@ CI@@ ) strateg@@ y.
These commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based workers are based in affected areas such as Khayelitsha and the E@@ astern Kli@@ p@@ fontein sub@@ -@@ distr@@ ic@@ ts.
In addi@@ tion the Department has also employed and train@@ ed four coordin@@ ators in the IM@@ CI@@ -@@ strateg@@ y.
This IM@@ CI@@ -@@ strategy was origin@@ ally developed by the World Health Organis@@ ation and foc@@ uses on the child as a who@@ le, ra@@ ther than on a single disease or condi@@ tion.
"@@ S@@ ic@@ k children often ar@@ rive at primary health care facilities with a number of si@@ ck@@ nesses and have to be man@@ aged in an integrated manner at home and at the clinic@@ " m@@ in Uys sa@@ id@@ .
The aim of this intervention is to exp@@ and services in Khayelitsha with an additional service in Mitchell's Pla@@ in.
This is in line with the Provincial Govern@@ ment's I@@ kap@@ a Eli@@ hlumay@@ o strategy as it forms part of building human capital and streng@@ th@@ ening social cap@@ it@@ al.
Minister Uys said by Chris@@ t@@ m@@ as this year@@ , a total of 13@@ 4 commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based workers will assist and streng@@ then the Depart@@ ment's fi@@ ght against diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ al diseas@@ e.
E@@ very year@@ , about 12 million children in developing countries die before they re@@ ach their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ da@@ y, many during the first year of lif@@ e.
S@@ even in 10 of these de@@ ath@@ s are due to five main diseas@@ es: ac@@ ute resp@@ ir@@ atory infec@@ tions, diar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a, meas@@ l@@ es, mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion, and mal@@ ari@@ a.
Minister Uys ur@@ ged mo@@ thers to was@@ h their hand@@ s regul@@ ar@@ ly.
"@@ If your children have the disease they must be given f@@ l@@ uid@@ s immedi@@ ately to prevent de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ id@@ .
There is a si@@ mp@@ le re@@ cip@@ e of a mix@@ ture mo@@ thers can give to their childr@@ en@@ :
* Was@@ h a bo@@ tt@@ le and a spo@@ on
* Was@@ h hand@@ s with so@@ a@@ p and water

State@@ ment by Provincial Health Minister Pierre Uys on streng@@ th@@ ening Home B@@ ased Care Services in the Western Cape
21 November 2005
The important role of hom@@ e-@@ based care in the Western Cape Health Services was em@@ ph@@ asi@@ sed ag@@ ain to@@ day by min@@ . Uys during his visit to health care workers at Citrus@@ d@@ al.
Home B@@ ased Care is the provision of basic nur@@ sing care needs by form@@ al or inform@@ al car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver@@ s to si@@ ck people in the com@@ for@@ t of their hom@@ es.
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st people who quali@@ fy for this care are those who have had stro@@ k@@ es, who are living with HIV and A@@ id@@ s, who are physi@@ cally or ment@@ ally chall@@ en@@ ge@@ d, fr@@ ail ol@@ der person@@ s, or those who are termin@@ ally ill@@ .
"@@ Hom@@ e-@@ based care is not a 24@@ -@@ h@@ our service and does not re@@ place the family as the primary car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver, but it is only me@@ ant to be a comple@@ mentary and sup@@ por@@ tive service to prevent car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver@@ s, who have no other op@@ tion but to care for si@@ ck rel@@ atives from over@@ working them@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ " says U@@ ys.
Commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based care is the care that people can access nearest to hom@@ e, which encour@@ ages participation by peop@@ le, resp@@ onds to the needs of peop@@ le, encour@@ ages traditional community life and cre@@ ates responsibi@@ li@@ ties.
Car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver@@ s from the various organisations have to complete a hom@@ e-@@ based care course facilit@@ ated by the Department of Health@@ .
Cont@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s, in-@@ service training is provided by the Department to ensure compet@@ ence.

1. Ho@@ t Water Ge@@ ys@@ er
* In@@ su@@ late the ge@@ ys@@ er by w@@ r@@ app@@ ing it in a ge@@ ys@@ er b@@ lan@@ k@@ et and sa@@ ve R@@ 10 and R@@ 20 / month@@ .
* In@@ st@@ all a ti@@ mer on the ge@@ ys@@ er to a@@ vo@@ id he@@ ating up water when you don@@ 't need it.
This can sa@@ ve up to 20@@ % on your elec@@ tricity b@@ ill@@ .

This pa@@ ys back in elec@@ tricity sav@@ ing over appro@@ xim@@ ately 8 years and u@@ ti@@ liz@@ es a renew@@ able s@@ our@@ ce of en@@ erg@@ y.
* Par@@ tic@@ ul@@ arly is you are building a new hou@@ se, it is a s@@ ound economic cho@@ ic@@ e.
E@@ sti@@ m@@ ated sav@@ ings of 20@@ -@@ 40@@ % of the total elec@@ tricity b@@ ill@@ .
2. Li@@ gh@@ ting
* U@@ se C@@ F@@ L@@ 's or LE@@ D@@ '@@ s, which are more en@@ ergy eff@@ ici@@ ent, ra@@ ther than normal inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent ligh@@ ts for any ligh@@ ts which st@@ ay on longer than an h@@ our or two per da@@ y-@@ especially good for outside f@@ it@@ tings which st@@ ay on all ni@@ gh@@ t.

* In@@ su@@ late your w@@ al@@ ls and f@@ lo@@ ors well@@ , or use ther@@ m@@ ally efficient building materi@@ al@@ s.
HOW TO SA@@ VE W@@ ATE@@ R
The following are some exam@@ ples of what can be done in your home to make it more water efficient
1. By re@@ duc@@ ing your to@@ il@@ et f@@ l@@ us@@ h vol@@ um@@ e you can sa@@ ve 20@@ % of your total water consum@@ ption with no re@@ duction in con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence.
D@@ u@@ al-@@ f@@ l@@ us@@ h or multi@@ -@@ f@@ l@@ us@@ h systems can be inst@@ alle@@ d.
The du@@ al-@@ f@@ l@@ us@@ h de@@ vice has two fix@@ ed sett@@ ings@@ -@@ a light s@@ etting for ur@@ ine and a he@@ a@@ vier one for soli@@ d@@ s.
The multi@@ -@@ f@@ l@@ us@@ h de@@ vice l@@ ets you f@@ l@@ us@@ h any amount you wan@@ t-@@ j@@ ust lif@@ t the handle back up and the f@@ l@@ us@@ h st@@ op@@ s.
2. By inst@@ al@@ ling a system to p@@ um@@ p gre@@ y water (@@ from the was@@ hing mach@@ in@@ e, b@@ as@@ in@@ s, sho@@ wer and b@@ ath@@ ) to the g@@ ard@@ en, most hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds will eli@@ min@@ ate the need for any additional g@@ ar@@ den water@@ ing.
This can re@@ duce your consum@@ ption by 35@@ %@@ .
These systems cost around R@@ 4 500 to inst@@ all, but will pay them@@ sel@@ ves back in water sav@@ ings in about 2 years.
3. F@@ it@@ ting low@@ -@@ f@@ low sho@@ wer@@ he@@ ads will re@@ duce sho@@ wer water used by 50@@ -@@ 75@@ %@@ .
V@@ ari@@ ous types are available dep@@ ending on the level of us@@ er com@@ for@@ t desi@@ re@@ d.
S@@ ho@@ w@@ ering is in any case more water efficient than b@@ ath@@ ing, even without these sho@@ wer he@@ ad@@ s.
4. Ta@@ p a@@ er@@ ators re@@ duce the f@@ low in k@@ itch@@ en t@@ ap@@ s by around 50@@ -@@ 75@@ %@@ .
Nor@@ m@@ ally much water from these t@@ ap@@ s f@@ low@@ s str@@ ai@@ ght down the sin@@ k without being us@@ ed.
HOW TO MINI@@ MI@@ SE W@@ A@@ STE
The Western Cape is produc@@ ing more was@@ te than it can di@@ spo@@ se of@@ .
The A@@ ver@@ age Cap@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ an produc@@ es 1.@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ gr@@ ams of was@@ te per da@@ y.
Water se@@ eping through the land@@ f@@ ills po@@ l@@ lu@@ te the groun@@ d@@ water and the ear@@ th@@ .
The following poin@@ ts give you some ide@@ as of what can be done in your own home to minim@@ ise the amount of was@@ te that you produc@@ e.
1. Recyc@@ le as much of your ref@@ u@@ ge as pos@@ si@@ ble.
The following products can be rec@@ yc@@ le@@ d@@ : pap@@ er, g@@ las@@ s, tin@@ s, pla@@ sti@@ c@@ , organ@@ ics and c@@ ar o@@ il@@ .
There are rec@@ yc@@ ling de@@ po@@ ts at a number of schools or organis@@ tions.
Contact your local municipality or telephone director@@ y to find a rec@@ yc@@ ler ne@@ ar you.
M@@ ake use of a tw@@ in or tri@@ o b@@ in syste@@ m.
These are hou@@ se@@ hold bin@@ s that have been separ@@ ated into com@@ part@@ ments to al@@ low for e@@ as@@ y rec@@ yc@@ l@@ ing.
Di@@ ffer@@ ent rec@@ y@@ cla@@ b@@ les can go into different col@@ our co@@ ded com@@ part@@ ments.
2. Com@@ post your organ@@ ic material (@@ k@@ itch@@ en and g@@ ar@@ den was@@ te@@ ).
Com@@ post can be used in the g@@ ar@@ den by mix@@ ing it with the so@@ il to improve the so@@ il struc@@ ture.
It increas@@ es the amount of organ@@ ic matter in the so@@ il and provides nu@@ tri@@ ents that will assist the plan@@ ts to gro@@ w@@ .
3. R@@ e-@@ use contain@@ ers as much as possible and ensure that the goods that you bu@@ y are not over@@ p@@ ack@@ aged in pla@@ sti@@ c.
If they are, complain@@ !
It ra@@ is@@ es awar@@ en@@ ess.
* If you are de@@ cor@@ at@@ ing, choo@@ ses pa@@ in@@ ts and v@@ ar@@ nis@@ h@@ es that are sol@@ ven@@ t-@@ free and organ@@ ic@@ .
* S@@ wit@@ ch off your tele@@ vision in@@ stead of le@@ av@@ ing it on stand@@ by@@ -@@ T@@ V@@ 's on stand@@ by still consum@@ e a qu@@ ar@@ ter of their normal power@@ .
* M@@ ake use of public transport or w@@ alk or c@@ yc@@ le to work or to the shop@@ s.
Driv@@ er a sm@@ all@@ er c@@ ar as this uses less fu@@ el, rele@@ ases less po@@ l@@ lution and requi@@ res fe@@ wer resources to manufac@@ ture.
W@@ ATER@@ -@@ W@@ IS@@ E G@@ AR@@ D@@ EN@@ ING
B@@ ec@@ ause g@@ ard@@ ens are often so water inten@@ si@@ v@@ e, it is us@@ ef@@ ul to l@@ ook at principles of water@@ -@@ wise g@@ ar@@ den@@ ing.
They are also low@@ er maintenance than normal g@@ ard@@ ens@@ .
The following ti@@ ps are taken from â@@ @@ Water@@ -@@ wise g@@ ar@@ den@@ ing@@ â@@  (@@ D@@ W@@ A@@ F and N@@ BI@@ , 199@@ 8@@ ):

"@@ 29 million con@@ d@@ oms will be distribu@@ ted by the Health Department in our@@ province al@@ one this year " Minister Uys said to@@ da@@ y.
Minister Uys said you can get an ST@@ I from having se@@ x only once with an infected part@@ n@@ er.
There are more than 20 different types of infec@@ tion, which can be spread through sexual contac@@ t.
Some of these are sy@@ p@@ hi@@ li@@ s, g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a (@@ dro@@ p@@ ) and her@@ p@@ es.
There are no vi@@ sible sign@@ s of the illness in the early st@@ ages and it may take years before a person becomes ill@@ .
D@@ uring this time the infec@@ tion can be passed on to sexual part@@ ners@@ .
Minister Uys says one in every 10 s@@ exually ac@@ tive persons in SA is infected with an STI@@ .
H@@ e said that if it is le@@ f@@ t un@@ tre@@ ate@@ d, STI@@ 's can c@@ ause :
* inf@@ erti@@ lity
* cancer of the se@@ x org@@ ans
* ab@@ nor@@ ma@@ lities or death of un@@ bor@@ n bab@@ ies
* dam@@ age to the he@@ ar@@ t and k@@ id@@ ne@@ ys
* mental illness
Minister Uys said people must know their bo@@ dies and se@@ ek medical treatment at our health facilities when they notice the following sign@@ s:
* Ab@@ normal dis@@ charge from sexual organ@@ s.
E@@ ven a s@@ light water@@ y dis@@ charge may be an indic@@ ation of an ST@@ I
* S@@ or@@ es, war@@ ts or b@@ lis@@ ters around the se@@ x organ@@ s, which may be pa@@ inf@@ ul or@@ pa@@ in@@ less
* Sw@@ ol@@ l@@ en g@@ lands ne@@ ar the se@@ x org@@ ans
If a person is diagno@@ sed with an ST@@ I or notice some of the sign@@ s, he or she must
* In@@ form all their se@@ x part@@ ners if there are more than one (@@ alth@@ ough this is not recom@@ men@@ de@@ d@@ ) and get them to go for treatment as well@@ , even if they have no sign@@ s of any infec@@ tion
* T@@ ake the full course of medic@@ ines and do not share it with their part@@ ner
* Th@@ at person must get his or her own medic@@ in@@ e.
If you don@@ 't take the ful@@ l@@ cour@@ se, you may th@@ ink you are c@@ ure@@ d, when in f@@ act you are not
Minister Uys said to con@@ dom@@ ise is the best preven@@ tion@@ .@@ "

M@@ ess@@ age By Western Cape Premier E@@ bra@@ him R@@ as@@ ool
Cultural f@@ esti@@ v@@ als in the Western Cape have one thing in comm@@ on@@ : they serve as a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in which communities in our province can see them@@ sel@@ ves as di@@ ver@@ se group@@ s - all of them em@@ bed@@ ded in one op@@ ul@@ ent Western Cape mo@@ sa@@ ic@@ .
To re@@ ally be able to build a Home for All in the Western Cape, it is important that we should open up to one another and create an environment in which we will be free to inter@@ act with other peop@@ le.
This is what mak@@ es ar@@ ts and cultural as well as community f@@ esti@@ v@@ als such as the Lit@@ t@@ le Karoo National Arts F@@ esti@@ val (@@ kno@@ wn as the "@@ K@@ K@@ N@@ K@@ "@@ ) so valu@@ able and en@@ ric@@ h@@ ing.
We should continue to intro@@ duce and ex@@ pose our people to the ric@@ h diversity of c@@ ult@@ ur@@ es, be@@ li@@ ef@@ s, practices and values in the Western Cape, and en@@ able them to en@@ jo@@ y the ple@@ as@@ ure of re@@ ally begin@@ ning to under@@ stand one another and developing a de@@ ep app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for each oth@@ er.
Th@@ at is wh@@ y the Provincial Government of the Western Cape is continu@@ ing its support of ic@@ on@@ ic events and f@@ esti@@ v@@ als such as the K@@ K@@ N@@ K and other f@@ esti@@ v@@ als in the provin@@ c@@ e: these events are v@@ ital for dis@@ cover@@ ing what is important to f@@ el@@ low Western Cape resid@@ ents and for learning more about it.
The im@@ age in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r is a fine one - let us make sure that as many people as possible get to see it and en@@ jo@@ y its be@@ au@@ ty.
I wish to th@@ ank the man@@ age@@ ment, participating arti@@ st@@ s, sp@@ ons@@ or@@ s, the community of Oudtshoorn and sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding areas@@ , and all other ro@@ le@@ -@@ pla@@ y@@ ers for hel@@ ping us build A Home for Al@@ l.

This s@@ ensi@@ bility under@@ p@@ ins President Th@@ ab@@ o Mbek@@ i@@ 's ass@@ er@@ tion that South Africa is in its A@@ ge of Hop@@ e, and the Western Cape Provin@@ ce@@ 's Hop@@ e, that we are on the Th@@ res@@ hold of Pro@@ sper@@ ity.
This H@@ ope is n@@ either trans@@ c@@ end@@ ental n@@ or s@@ enti@@ ment@@ al, but f@@ oun@@ ded on pati@@ ence and end@@ less human practi@@ ce.
It loc@@ ates each one of us within an un@@ fol@@ ding human dr@@ ama in which we sh@@ un both do@@ g@@ mati@@ s@@ m and com@@ pla@@ c@@ enc@@ y.
O@@ ur role in the dr@@ ama is taking sh@@ ap@@ e.
When I deliver@@ ed my first bud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h for the Department of the Premier in 2004, we set out to respon@@ d to the chall@@ en@@ ge of building a Mo@@ der@@ n African State by la@@ ying the ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical f@@ ound@@ ations of the state as develop@@ ment@@ al.
We under@@ st@@ ood that to depar@@ t from the kind of state that the Des@@ a@@ i Commission war@@ ned us about was to ori@@ ent the state towards achiev@@ ing the objec@@ tives of the National Programme of Ac@@ tion and the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ als for our Provin@@ ce.
I pro@@ posed to you then the b@@ lu@@ ep@@ r@@ int of a state that was integrated in it@@ self@@ , coo@@ per@@ ative in its relations with other spher@@ es of govern@@ ment, respon@@ sive to its citizens and part@@ n@@ ers, and glo@@ bal@@ ly@@ -@@ con@@ nec@@ ted for its relevan@@ ce.
In my 2005 Bud@@ get Spe@@ ec@@ h for the Department of the Premier I war@@ ned that the p@@ ath towards a Development State would require de@@ ep transform@@ ation.
I pro@@ posed a process that would see the re@@ eng@@ ine@@ ering of the Centre of the St@@ ate, in which that Centre would ga@@ ther together a skills s@@ et, dra@@ wn from the best of those in@@ side and outside of the Administr@@ ation, capable of gi@@ ving lea@@ ders@@ hi@@ p, s@@ etting the policy ag@@ end@@ a and driving the implementation of the strateg@@ y.
Mr Spe@@ ak@@ er, in my third Bud@@ get Spe@@ ec@@ h as Premi@@ er, I can report to this Hou@@ se that we have achiev@@ ed both s@@ ets of objec@@ tiv@@ es, and we are now ready to c@@ l@@ ari@@ fy the next sc@@ ene of the un@@ fol@@ ding dr@@ ama of building and re@@ war@@ ding the H@@ ope that An@@ ton@@ i@@ o Gr@@ am@@ sc@@ i spe@@ ak@@ s ab@@ ou@@ t.
We in this Province are not al@@ one in this un@@ fol@@ ding dr@@ am@@ a.
We are part of a glob@@ al concer@@ n that se@@ eks to con@@ soli@@ date h@@ ope by defin@@ ing a S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth p@@ ath - that which we call iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o - and building social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on while nur@@ t@@ uring diversity - what we en@@ vision as a Home for Al@@ l.
Rec@@ ently I was in@@ vi@@ ted to jo@@ in a ga@@ th@@ ering of progres@@ sive world lea@@ ders con@@ ven@@ ed by President Mbek@@ i at the Pro@@ gres@@ sive Govern@@ ance S@@ um@@ mit prec@@ is@@ ely because what we are do@@ ing in this Province res@@ on@@ ates with the h@@ op@@ es of the world to find a p@@ ath to social j@@ us@@ tic@@ e, economic equ@@ ity and a way of living together in the fac@@ e of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m, in@@ tol@@ er@@ ance and mar@@ gin@@ alis@@ ation.
En@@ d@@ less human practi@@ ce, as Gr@@ am@@ sc@@ i would have to@@ ld such world lea@@ der@@ s, would in@@ si@@ st that the p@@ ath to such a fu@@ ture is based on anal@@ ysi@@ s, planning and strateg@@ y.
An@@ al@@ ysi@@ s, planning and strategy dra@@ w from the glob@@ al to the local and inform from the local to the glo@@ bal@@ .
P@@ G@@ D@@ S: The F@@ oundation St@@ one of Pro@@ sper@@ ity
In the con@@ text of South Afric@@ a, our Province is required to f@@ as@@ hi@@ on a Provincial Gro@@ wth and Development Strateg@@ y (P@@ G@@ D@@ S) out of the National Sp@@ ati@@ al Development Per@@ spec@@ tive and, in tur@@ n, ensure that the Integrated Development Plans of all local govern@@ ments are in this single i@@ ma@@ ge.
This ens@@ ures both co@@ her@@ ence and allow@@ s us all to work tan@@ gi@@ bly to create a better life for all our peop@@ le.
L@@ ast year Minister Mu@@ fam@@ a@@ di@@ 's department published guidel@@ ines on what a P@@ G@@ D@@ S is.
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Guidelin@@ es,
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S is based on a l@@ ong@@ -@@ term view of the provin@@ ce@@ 's development tra@@ jec@@ tor@@ y.
D@@ ra@@ wing on the N@@ S@@ D@@ P and the M@@ TS@@ F and working within a sustainable development par@@ a@@ dig@@ m, the primary purpose of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S is to provide a col@@ labor@@ ative framework to dri@@ ve implementation within the province.
It is not a provincial government plan@@ , but a develop@@ mental framework for the province as a who@@ le.
We are about to fin@@ ali@@ se what we th@@ ink this develop@@ mental framework for the Western Cape is.
It will be the ra@@ is@@ on@@ '@@ d@@ Ãª@@ tr@@ e of my department and this government.
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to ren@@ own@@ ed planning the@@ or@@ is@@ t, Pr@@ of P@@ at@@ sy He@@ al@@ e@@ y, it will intro@@ duce the most radi@@ cal and f@@ ar@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing changes se@@ en in terms of the appro@@ ach we have adop@@ ted.
S@@ he ar@@ gu@@ es that@@ :
..@@ .@@ strateg@@ y-@@ making is a process of deli@@ ber@@ ative par@@ a@@ dig@@ m chan@@ ge.
It aims to change cultural conc@@ ep@@ tions, systems of under@@ standing and systems me@@ an@@ ing.
It is more than j@@ ust produc@@ ing collec@@ tive deci@@ sion@@ s.
It is about shi@@ f@@ ting and re-@@ sh@@ ap@@ ing con@@ vic@@ tion@@ s@@ .@@ 3
At the he@@ ar@@ t of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S is the par@@ a@@ dig@@ m of shar@@ ed growth and integrated develop@@ ment.
As we proc@@ eed to eng@@ age our social part@@ ners and the citiz@@ en@@ ry at lar@@ ge over the next few month@@ s, I be@@ li@@ eve we will be able to make this development par@@ a@@ dig@@ m he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic, not least because its se@@ eds have already been so@@ wn by the iKapa Eli@@ hlumay@@ o processes that have un@@ fol@@ ded over the p@@ ast few year@@ s, including the Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit of 200@@ 3.
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S ar@@ gu@@ es that in the con@@ text of m@@ assi@@ ve un@@ employ@@ ment, per@@ ver@@ se income in@@ equ@@ ali@@ ties, de@@ ep social divi@@ des and the potential mar@@ gin@@ alisation of our national econ@@ omy from the glob@@ al econom@@ y, our pri@@ ority must be the achiev@@ e@@ ment of much higher rates of growth as the sp@@ r@@ ing@@ bo@@ ard for de@@ aling with the range of in@@ trac@@ table chall@@ eng@@ es we fac@@ e.
High@@ er rates of growth on their own are not suff@@ ici@@ ent@@ ; it is the nature of growth that is cri@@ tic@@ al.
We must ensure that higher rates of growth are com@@ bin@@ ed with greater social equ@@ ity that will en@@ able the poor and econom@@ ically exclu@@ ded to ga@@ in the means to participate in the econ@@ omy and build their own s@@ our@@ ces of em@@ power@@ ment, com@@ bin@@ ed with effective protection of the natural resource b@@ ase of the province.
L@@ ast@@ ly, growth must not wor@@ s@@ en sp@@ ati@@ al ap@@ ar@@ theid and in@@ eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es, as it has in the first dec@@ ade of fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .
It must make life more con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent and af@@ for@@ d@@ able for the majority of our people who are des@@ per@@ ate to access econom@@ ic, social and ec@@ o@@ logical opportun@@ ities.
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S - iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o - s@@ ets out how our Province will achi@@ eve a shar@@ ed growth and integrated development pa@@ th@@ .
F@@ ol@@ low@@ ing the logi@@ c of ac@@ up@@ un@@ c@@ ture@@ , it will ent@@ ail more tar@@ ge@@ ted ac@@ tion, more strategi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment, better lea@@ ders@@ hip and greater effecti@@ ven@@ ess and co-@@ operation from government in the Western Cape.
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S is the further e@@ vol@@ ution of that which has already been b@@ rou@@ ght to this Hou@@ se in the form of the eight iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o strategi@@ es: Sp@@ ati@@ al Develop@@ ment, Social Cap@@ it@@ al, Human Cap@@ it@@ al, M@@ ic@@ ro@@ -@@ Econ@@ om@@ ic, Strategic Infrastr@@ uc@@ ture@@ , and the three Govern@@ ance Strategi@@ es.
These will now need re@@ foc@@ using so that@@ , in tur@@ n, they achi@@ eve the practi@@ cal objec@@ tives I set out in my State of the Province Ad@@ d@@ res@@ s ear@@ lier this year as the B@@ att@@ le Plan for S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ w@@ th@@ .
They are, by way of re@@ min@@ der@@ :
* economic particip@@ ation@@ ;
* infrastructure that con@@ nec@@ ts@@ ;
* effective public tran@@ sport@@ ;
* sustainable integrated human sett@@ lements@@ ;
* res@@ ili@@ ent commun@@ iti@@ es;
* a culture of tol@@ er@@ ance, respect and eng@@ age@@ ment@@ ; and
* effective govern@@ ance institu@@ tions.
However, the glob@@ al and national tar@@ gets we have been set for 201@@ 4, require even greater levels of g@@ al@@ van@@ is@@ ation and har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing of en@@ ergi@@ es, resources and t@@ al@@ en@@ ts.
Th@@ is, there@@ for@@ e, means the immedi@@ ate p@@ urs@@ uit of five p@@ ath bre@@ ak@@ ing inter@@ ven@@ tions, all of which are ger@@ man@@ e to any growth pa@@ th, some of which nee@@ ded work from a long time ag@@ o@@ , and oth@@ ers which have emer@@ ged as ur@@ g@@ ent either because we fac@@ e a mo@@ ment of cri@@ sis or opportun@@ ity.
These are the five inter@@ ven@@ tions which cabinet has gr@@ app@@ led with and which needs ur@@ g@@ ent imple@@ ment@@ ation.
Public Transport
Fir@@ st@@ ly, addres@@ sing the cri@@ sis in Public Transport that serv@@ es as a br@@ ake on the econom@@ y, social eng@@ age@@ ment, community safety and environmental integr@@ ity.
I be@@ li@@ eve that if there is only one succ@@ ess this P@@ G@@ D@@ S achiev@@ es, it must be the tur@@ n-@@ around of the state of public tran@@ spor@@ t.
Con@@ cre@@ te@@ ly, we have poten@@ ti@@ ally achiev@@ ed an important mil@@ est@@ one to find additional s@@ our@@ ces of revenue to inv@@ est in transport infrastructure through the provi@@ sional appro@@ val of the pro@@ posed fu@@ el lev@@ y for the Western Cape.
The Finance and Fis@@ cal Commission has indic@@ ated that we are on the right p@@ ath in sup@@ ple@@ men@@ ting our revenue b@@ ase and our fe@@ asi@@ bility research is s@@ oun@@ d.
This is a maj@@ or bre@@ ak@@ through after four years.
Of course we end@@ or@@ se their call for de@@ ep@@ er consult@@ ation.
World C@@ up 2010
Sec@@ ond@@ ly, maxim@@ ising the opportunities sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the 2010 World C@@ up in terms of gro@@ wing tourism and related sec@@ tors of our regional econom@@ y, promo@@ ting health@@ y li@@ fes@@ ty@@ les cho@@ ic@@ es am@@ ong@@ st the youth and k@@ ick@@ -@@ star@@ ting ur@@ gen@@ tly nee@@ ded infrastructure inv@@ est@@ ments to improve the f@@ low of people and g@@ ood@@ s.
This am@@ bi@@ tion has been given renew@@ ed imp@@ et@@ us by the agreement we rec@@ ently achiev@@ ed between the Ma@@ y@@ or and my@@ self that the establish@@ ment of a special purpose vehicle must be ex@@ pe@@ di@@ ted through provincial legisl@@ ation.
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, the national me@@ eting we atten@@ ded with the LO@@ C has ce@@ men@@ ted the resol@@ ve to ho@@ st the World C@@ up at a new Gre@@ en Po@@ int Sta@@ di@@ um@@ .
In light of these encour@@ aging develop@@ men@@ ts, I am con@@ vin@@ ced that the World C@@ up buil@@ d@@ -@@ up and leg@@ acy will gre@@ at@@ ly en@@ h@@ ance our development am@@ bi@@ tions for the province.
It is now time for all of us in the province to uni@@ te be@@ hin@@ d ef@@ for@@ ts for World C@@ up 2010 and ensure that we do in@@ de@@ ed ho@@ st an ev@@ ent that will fir@@ m@@ ly lodge the Western Cape in the wor@@ l@@ d@@ 's min@@ d as a must@@ -@@ see pla@@ ce.
The Cape so@@ cc@@ er f@@ ra@@ ternity is already en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic as bi@@ g c@@ ro@@ w@@ ds view@@ ed S@@ an@@ to@@ s and Han@@ over Park rec@@ ent@@ ly.
E@@ ven V@@ as@@ c@@ o da G@@ ama put up a sp@@ i@@ ri@@ ted vic@@ tori@@ ous performance against B@@ us@@ h B@@ uc@@ ks over the week@@ end@@ .
O@@ ur En@@ ergy Sup@@ p@@ ly
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly, the en@@ ergy w@@ ake-@@ up call we received rec@@ ently in the Western Cape is a potential th@@ re@@ at to higher rates of economic growth over the medi@@ um@@ -@@ ter@@ m.
However, higher rates of inves@@ tment in en@@ ergy also create an opportun@@ ity to pur@@ su@@ e a more di@@ versi@@ fied portfolio of en@@ ergy tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies which can position the Western Cape to gro@@ w the size of its environmental indus@@ tri@@ es.
In this regard gre@@ at progres@@ s is being made through the plan@@ ned inv@@ est@@ ments by E@@ sk@@ om that have been b@@ rou@@ ght for@@ war@@ d.
The la@@ t@@ ter initi@@ ative intro@@ duc@@ es the deb@@ ate in this Province on the s@@ our@@ ce of en@@ ergy for such a b@@ ase st@@ ation.
The transport of co@@ al is exp@@ ensive and the g@@ as supp@@ lies are not y@@ et re@@ li@@ ab@@ le.
The n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar en@@ ergy deb@@ ate is one all of us must participate in.
Skills Development
F@@ our@@ th@@ ly, fix@@ ing the serious skills mis@@ mat@@ ch between what the regional econ@@ omy needs and what comes on@@ to the labour market from the education system has become the main dis@@ jun@@ c@@ ture in our soci@@ ety and econom@@ y, fu@@ ell@@ ing in@@ equ@@ ali@@ ty.
This matter is begin@@ ning to receive pri@@ ority atten@@ tion and our Province is le@@ ading through the R@@ 70@@ m rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of our FE@@ T Col@@ leg@@ es under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a R@@ 25@@ m lo@@ an schem@@ e.
The establish@@ ment of focus schools respond@@ ing to the variety of skills needs in the province si@@ mil@@ arly pa@@ th@@ -@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing.
On@@ ly last week sa@@ w the op@@ ening of an En@@ gin@@ e@@ ering F@@ o@@ c@@ us School in Mitchell's Pla@@ in, and planning for Institu@@ tes for Con@@ temporary Musi@@ c resp@@ onds to the Western Cape emer@@ ging str@@ ong@@ ly as a cre@@ ative centre in the countr@@ y.
Fin@@ al@@ ly, the Western Cape@@ 's As@@ g@@ is@@ a project - The Cape F@@ la@@ ts R@@ en@@ ew@@ al Programme - must come to fr@@ ui@@ tion as the who@@ le country r@@ al@@ lies be@@ hin@@ d this ex@@ tra@@ ordinary intervention to r@@ at@@ ch@@ et up growth through@@ , pri@@ mar@@ il@@ y, infrastr@@ uc@@ ture@@ -@@ d@@ riv@@ en programm@@ es.
G@@ i@@ ven that this intervention co@@ in@@ ci@@ des sp@@ ati@@ ally where the majority of poor people res@@ ide in the provin@@ ce, it is also appropriate that it is part of the high@@ est pri@@ or@@ ities of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S.
O@@ ur dr@@ aft P@@ G@@ D@@ S will be un@@ vei@@ led next month for public eng@@ age@@ ment.
It is fully compli@@ ant with the following s@@ enti@@ ment in the P@@ G@@ D@@ S Guidelin@@ es:
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S is the c@@ ore a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment mechanis@@ m for the province and it should be se@@ en as the coordin@@ ation and implementation strateg@@ y.
Whi@@ le d@@ riv@@ en by the province and ch@@ amp@@ ion@@ ed by the Premi@@ er, this must be on the basis of a col@@ labor@@ ative ef@@ for@@ t that br@@ ings all parties to the tab@@ le.
G@@ i@@ ven that we are advan@@ ced in our province towards a P@@ G@@ D@@ S, I now want to tur@@ n to the implementation vehicles we will have to establish and over@@ ha@@ ul to imple@@ ment our development strategy for the Provin@@ ce.
Im@@ ple@@ mentation Fr@@ ame@@ works and In@@ stitutional V@@ ehic@@ les
The P@@ G@@ D@@ S is fun@@ da@@ ment@@ ally about coordin@@ ation, a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment and integr@@ ation ac@@ ross provincial government depart@@ men@@ ts, between spher@@ es of government between different state bo@@ dies and between government and its social part@@ ners@@ .
Impro@@ ved Cabinet Sy@@ stem
This will work only with a str@@ ong policy centre at the he@@ ar@@ t of government.
This requi@@ res a more foc@@ used Cabinet that can syste@@ mati@@ cally dri@@ ve the strategy ag@@ end@@ a of iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o as it cas@@ c@@ ades into the pri@@ or@@ ities and ac@@ tions of all ac@@ tors in the province.
In this con@@ text we in@@ a@@ ug@@ ur@@ ated the new@@ , more strateg@@ ically foc@@ us@@ ed, Cabinet system which se@@ es the intro@@ duction of an implementation ori@@ ent@@ ated and a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment@@ -@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed appro@@ ach@@ .
A Policy Centre in Government
The new Cabinet system is under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a much more co@@ her@@ ent policy centre in government.
The re@@ eng@@ ine@@ ering process of my department has now b@@ rou@@ ght into being a form@@ id@@ able policy te@@ am at the centre of government.
In its establish@@ ment and oper@@ ation@@ alis@@ ation, the new policy ner@@ ve centre in my Department will work hand@@ -@@ in-@@ glo@@ ve with the economic and bud@@ ge@@ tary policy anal@@ ysi@@ s capacity in Provincial Treasur@@ y and the te@@ am of municipal anal@@ y@@ sts in the Department of Housing and Local Govern@@ ment.
Al@@ read@@ y, the three enti@@ ties have learn@@ t to work together and h@@ one their skills in the development so f@@ ar of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S.
Inter@@ -@@ Govern@@ mental Rel@@ ations
O@@ ur Cabinet system and the policy capacity has been ti@@ med to anti@@ cipate wh@@ at@@ , over the last year@@ , has been a ver@@ it@@ able re@@ vol@@ ution in inter@@ -@@ govern@@ mental relations and planning in South Afric@@ a, con@@ soli@@ dated by the Inter@@ -@@ Govern@@ mental Rel@@ ations Act of 200@@ 5.
On the basis of the IG@@ R Act, the Presid@@ ent@@ 's C@@ oordin@@ ating Council has become the su@@ pre@@ me forum for driving an a@@ lig@@ ned ag@@ end@@ a of delivery ac@@ ross the spher@@ es of government.
The ag@@ end@@ a of the P@@ CC is the pri@@ or@@ ities sp@@ el@@ led out in the Medi@@ um@@ -@@ Ter@@ m Strategic Fr@@ amework and the National Sp@@ ati@@ al Development Per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, which are lar@@ gel@@ y trans@@ lated into the National Programme of Ac@@ tion.
It is assum@@ ed that all Provin@@ ces and Municipali@@ ties must reflec@@ t the imp@@ lic@@ ations of the National Programme of Ac@@ tion in their respective development ag@@ end@@ as (P@@ G@@ D@@ S and ID@@ P@@ s@@ ).
I am comp@@ el@@ led by the IG@@ R Act to use the Premi@@ er's C@@ oordin@@ ating Forum (P@@ C@@ F@@ ) to ensure ex@@ ac@@ tly such a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment.
Th@@ us, in the following year we will see much greater em@@ ph@@ asis being pla@@ ced on str@@ ong and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful inter@@ -@@ govern@@ mental planning and eng@@ agement in the provin@@ ce, based on the N@@ S@@ D@@ P and the P@@ G@@ D@@ S.
In light of the political fr@@ ag@@ i@@ lity in many municipalities in the provin@@ ce, I am determined to use the instru@@ ments of the IG@@ R Act to en@@ gen@@ der cal@@ m and st@@ ability and ensure a focus on service delivery so that we can all work sing@@ le@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ly to achi@@ eve the strategi@@ c go@@ als of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S, iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o@@ .
J@@ ust because we have local govern@@ ments govern@@ ed by co@@ ali@@ tions, with the on@@ going pro@@ spec@@ ts of changes as co@@ ali@@ tions may chan@@ ge, does not me@@ an that the public should suff@@ er through in@@ eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es, poor service delivery or political br@@ ink@@ man@@ shi@@ p.
The P@@ C@@ F will dri@@ ve co-ordin@@ ation of the activities of govern@@ ment, national depart@@ men@@ ts, state own@@ ed enterpris@@ es and special purpose ag@@ en@@ cies that oper@@ ate in the province to eng@@ age on the uni@@ qu@@ e regional d@@ yn@@ am@@ ics of the Western Cape so that these are appropri@@ ately reflec@@ ted and ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dated in national policy fr@@ ame@@ work@@ s, programm@@ es, projects and funding pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, as well as monitor the c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative impact of development in the Western Cape as we proc@@ eed with acceler@@ ated deliver@@ y.
Th@@ ree New Planning Reg@@ i@@ ons
The Provincial Sp@@ ati@@ al Development Fr@@ amework al@@ er@@ ted us last year to the geo@@ graph@@ ical way in which our pop@@ ul@@ ations are mo@@ v@@ ing, and in which economic opportunities are conc@@ entr@@ at@@ ing, and its impact on the natural resource b@@ ase of the province.
If these fac@@ tors are going to be key dri@@ ver@@ s for the implementation of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S, then political b@@ ound@@ aries may not be the most us@@ ef@@ ul way in which to conc@@ ei@@ ve of development planning for S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ w@@ th@@ .
If any@@ th@@ ing, shar@@ ed growth and integrated development would have a geo@@ graph@@ ical logi@@ c that would c@@ ross the political b@@ ound@@ aries of municipali@@ ties.
What is emer@@ ging at this st@@ age are three Development Planning Reg@@ ion@@ s.
The Premi@@ er's C@@ oordin@@ ating Forum would soon have to disc@@ us@@ s for@@ ma@@ lis@@ ing these Reg@@ i@@ ons to facilitate appropriate growth and development to coordin@@ ate better and har@@ ness exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture and inves@@ tment more intelligen@@ t@@ ly.
The Cape Town Fun@@ c@@ tional Reg@@ ion@@ , including Saldan@@ ha, Paarl, Worcester, Stellenbosch and parts of the Over@@ berg, if we plan its fu@@ ture together will har@@ ness some of the most productive indus@@ trial resources of the Province and con@@ soli@@ date it@@ self as our economic power@@ hou@@ se.
Al@@ read@@ y, 85@@ % of general value ad@@ ded in the provincial econ@@ omy comes from this area.
The South Cape ur@@ ban str@@ i@@ p from Plett@@ enberg Bay to Mossel Bay is sho@@ wing re@@ mark@@ able growth potential which requi@@ res coordin@@ ated planning and appropri@@ ately tar@@ ge@@ ted and sequ@@ enc@@ ed inv@@ est@@ ments.
This to@@ da@@ y, is a b@@ old deb@@ ate we want to open up so that we can best ensure the fu@@ ture of all our people and the qu@@ ick@@ est way to re@@ ach our growth and development tar@@ ge@@ ts.
Par@@ t@@ nershi@@ p@@ s: Inv@@ es@@ tment le@@ ver@@ aging
This means that we need str@@ on@@ ger rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps with the business commun@@ ity, but not only in the Provin@@ ce.
The Western Cape is fac@@ ing increas@@ ing competi@@ tion from products we have tradi@@ tion@@ ally exported and we are having to see off fi@@ er@@ ce chall@@ eng@@ es from countries like New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and (@@ in fil@@ m) and In@@ di@@ a (@@ in business process ou@@ ts@@ our@@ c@@ ing@@ ).
However, the g@@ ood@@ will towards us is so gre@@ at that sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant glob@@ al, national and domestic business lea@@ ders are keen to serve us in an advis@@ ory capac@@ ity.
Su@@ ch an Ad@@ vis@@ ory P@@ an@@ el will be con@@ ven@@ ed towards the end of the year as a plat@@ form from which we can improve economic performance and re@@ ach our growth tar@@ ge@@ ts.
Par@@ t@@ nershi@@ p@@ s: High@@ er Education Eng@@ agement
One of the di@@ st@@ inc@@ t com@@ par@@ ative advan@@ t@@ ages of the Western Cape is that we have four Uni@@ versi@@ ties based her@@ e, as well as the lar@@ ge f@@ oo@@ t@@ prin@@ t of Un@@ is@@ a.
Y@@ et we have been s@@ low in har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing this in@@ valu@@ able resour@@ ce.
We have con@@ ven@@ ed all the Vic@@ e-@@ C@@ han@@ c@@ ell@@ ors late last year to disc@@ us@@ s how we can part@@ ner to each other@@ 's mu@@ tual advanta@@ ge.
S@@ in@@ ce then there has been a ser@@ ies of close inter@@ ac@@ tions with the Cape High@@ er Education Con@@ s@@ or@@ ti@@ um (C@@ HE@@ C@@ ), which repres@@ ents the Uni@@ versi@@ ties, to work towards a Jo@@ int Programme of Ac@@ tion for S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth in the province.
This work will cul@@ min@@ ate in a Provincial Govern@@ ment@@ -@@ High@@ er Education Institu@@ tions S@@ um@@ mit later this year.
At the S@@ um@@ mit we will adop@@ t a C@@ oo@@ per@@ ation Ag@@ ree@@ ment that will facilitate a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment between the pri@@ or@@ ities of the Uni@@ versi@@ ties and our S@@ car@@ ce Skills Strateg@@ ies for the re@@ alisation of our I@@ kap@@ a eli@@ hlumay@@ o strategi@@ es.
Par@@ t@@ nershi@@ p@@ s: The Provincial Development Council
Strategic part@@ nershi@@ ps with key inves@@ tors and the uni@@ versi@@ ties comple@@ ment the institu@@ tion@@ alis@@ ed, part@@ nershi@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ as@@ ed, social di@@ al@@ og@@ ue part@@ ners in the P@@ D@@ C@@ .
D@@ uring 2006 we will focus our eng@@ age@@ ments on the P@@ G@@ D@@ S.
This process will invol@@ ve an exten@@ sive ar@@ ra@@ y of eng@@ age@@ ments with all s@@ eg@@ ments of soci@@ ety so that we can build a vi@@ br@@ ant demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c f@@ oundation for a cons@@ ens@@ us on, and the implementation of@@ , our shar@@ ed growth and integrated development ag@@ en@@ da@@ .
The pri@@ or@@ ities and monitoring indic@@ ators of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S will also en@@ h@@ ance the work of the P@@ D@@ C because eng@@ age@@ ments will be based on bud@@ ge@@ tary pri@@ or@@ ities and depart@@ mental ac@@ tions.
Cap@@ ac@@ ity of the State to D@@ rive the S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth B@@ att@@ le Plan
All our objec@@ tiv@@ es, strateg@@ ies and part@@ nershi@@ ps will come to n@@ au@@ ght unless we can address the capacity of the St@@ ate.
We have been working at this chall@@ en@@ ge in a radi@@ cal and syste@@ mati@@ c f@@ as@@ hi@@ on sin@@ ce the first day that I took office.
I am fin@@ ally in a position to report consider@@ able progres@@ s on this fr@@ ont@@ .
On the 1 April 2006 the new@@ , fully re@@ eng@@ in@@ eer@@ ed Department of the Premier c@@ ame into be@@ ing.
S@@ in@@ ce then the new@@ , represent@@ ative and high@@ ly quali@@ fied lea@@ ders@@ hip of the Department has beg@@ un their work.
O@@ ver two thir@@ ds of the new SM@@ S have post@@ -@@ gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate quali@@ fic@@ ations reflec@@ ting the di@@ ver@@ se and de@@ ep skills b@@ ase we s@@ ou@@ ght to at@@ trac@@ t.
They bring with them many years of experi@@ ence in both the Public and Private sec@@ tor.
Th@@ eir streng@@ ths sp@@ an gener@@ ic areas such as in person@@ n@@ el, fin@@ ance, legal and I@@ T man@@ age@@ ment, but also the skills related to policy develop@@ ment, implementation and re@@ view@@ .
They will bring to government a capacity for full policy co@@ her@@ ence and a@@ lig@@ n@@ ment through the l@@ ens of the P@@ G@@ D@@ S.
They will give lea@@ ders@@ hip in a ser@@ ies of human and social capital inter@@ ven@@ tions to address the sk@@ ill@@ s, ori@@ ent@@ ation, be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our@@ al and management cap@@ aci@@ ties of the Administration to ensure effective implementation of the S@@ har@@ ed Gro@@ wth ag@@ en@@ da@@ .
The new SM@@ S is also bro@@ ad@@ ly represent@@ ative of the provincial demo@@ graph@@ ics of the labour force in the Western Cape.
We have now fil@@ led 46 out of 53 post@@ s.
Of the 46@@ , 3@@ 1@@ % is Afric@@ an, 45@@ % Col@@ ou@@ red and 24@@ % Whi@@ te.
Of the 46 po@@ sts we have impro@@ ved the represent@@ ation of women from 9@@ % in 2004 to 33@@ % so f@@ ar@@ .
Where we need dr@@ as@@ tic action ac@@ ross government is in the repres@@ enti@@ v@@ ity of people with dis@@ abili@@ ties.
These demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c fi@@ g@@ ures repres@@ ent a fun@@ da@@ mental bre@@ ak with the sk@@ ew@@ ed and exclu@@ sion@@ ary pat@@ tern@@ s that I in@@ her@@ i@@ ted two years ag@@ o@@ , especially where we only had a single African person in the SM@@ S.
In the remain@@ ing appoin@@ t@@ ments we will se@@ ek to improve even further on the represent@@ ation of especially Col@@ ou@@ red people and women without being over@@ ly mechan@@ ic@@ al.
In Con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion
Mr Spe@@ ak@@ er, the c@@ ore of this third bud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h of min@@ e as Premier re@@ vol@@ ved around the P@@ G@@ D@@ S increas@@ ing@@ ly re@@ alis@@ ing a S@@ har@@ ed Pro@@ sper@@ ity for the Western Cape.
Th@@ at this is more possible is so only because we have done some of the h@@ ard work of de@@ ep in@@ stitutional trans@@ formation in this Provin@@ ce.
Y@@ et, even as we spe@@ ak here to@@ da@@ y, the ur@@ gency of what we must still do ec@@ ho@@ es all over this Provin@@ ce.
The li@@ ves of many are still defined by p@@ over@@ ty, un@@ employ@@ ment, viol@@ ence, and pa@@ tho@@ log@@ ies which emer@@ ge there@@ fro@@ m.
There are da@@ ily b@@ att@@ les between ordinary citizens and their instru@@ ments like the police on the one hand@@ , and for@@ ces who be@@ li@@ eve that the conditions of p@@ over@@ ty give them the right to conduct them@@ sel@@ ves un@@ law@@ fully and il@@ leg@@ al@@ ly.
I ref@@ er here to g@@ ang@@ s@@ ters and dr@@ ug@@ l@@ ord@@ s, but also ref@@ er to those who initi@@ ally ear@@ ned our sy@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y because they do the dan@@ ger@@ ous work of protec@@ ting us for very li@@ tt@@ le re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation.
B@@ ut in the course of a legal str@@ i@@ ke for leg@@ iti@@ mate objec@@ tiv@@ es, they have conduc@@ ted them@@ sel@@ ves in a way that mak@@ es us even w@@ onder whether they can be trus@@ ted to be the cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans of what we regard as pre@@ ci@@ ous in our Provin@@ ce.
I have no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that@@ , led by the polic@@ e, we will continue to protect our lea@@ der@@ s, our citizens@@ , our comm@@ u@@ ters and our pro@@ sper@@ ity against any acts of il@@ leg@@ ali@@ ty.
Mr Spe@@ ak@@ er, over the p@@ ast wh@@ i@@ le, our vision of making this Province a Home for All has been ser@@ i@@ ously chall@@ en@@ ge@@ d.
The r@@ un up to the Local Government elec@@ tions have re@@ vers@@ ed some of the ra@@ cial har@@ mon@@ y and social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on we have s@@ ou@@ ght to buil@@ d.
The out@@ comes of the elec@@ tions and the exis@@ ten@@ ce of un@@ st@@ able co@@ ali@@ tions have beg@@ un to th@@ re@@ ate@@ n some of the har@@ d@@ -@@ w@@ on st@@ ability achiev@@ ed in this Provin@@ ce.
Mo@@ st sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant@@ ly, we see the spec@@ tr@@ e of po@@ lar@@ is@@ ation, exclu@@ sion and di@@ vision in the Western Cape.
Do@@ es this me@@ an that the vision of a Home for All has f@@ ailed and is un@@ work@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
When Chief Albert L@@ u@@ th@@ ul@@ i first verb@@ alised this vi@@ sion@@ , it was met with three dec@@ ades of ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te state bru@@ ta@@ li@@ ty.
Ad@@ op@@ ting the s@@ ensi@@ bility of Gr@@ am@@ sc@@ i that h@@ ope is a long af@@ fair@@ , we si@@ mp@@ ly need to be more ten@@ aci@@ ous and work har@@ der to re@@ ali@@ se the vision of a Home for Al@@ l.
The year 2006 allow@@ s us two sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant opportunities to give imp@@ et@@ us to our vision of a Home for Al@@ l.
To@@ ge@@ ther with the rest of the countr@@ y, June will see us c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating the cour@@ age@@ , and comm@@ em@@ or@@ ating the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es, made by the youth in 19@@ 76@@ .
The Western Cape Youth Commission together with government and youth form@@ ations are planning a month of activities that will hon@@ our the pa@@ st@@ , but will la@@ y the f@@ ound@@ ations of un@@ ity for the fu@@ ture.
Sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ly, we will c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate fi@@ f@@ ty years of the mar@@ ch by women to the Uni@@ on Buil@@ d@@ ings, not si@@ mp@@ ly disp@@ la@@ ying their disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure as women with A@@ par@@ th@@ eid, but for@@ ever la@@ ying down their right to be equal citizens@@ , fully integrated into our soci@@ et@@ y.
In both these c@@ ele@@ br@@ ations, the Provincial Government Departments are h@@ ard at work to deli@@ ver con@@ cre@@ te@@ ly to youth and women that which I under@@ took as part of our Si@@ y@@ ab@@ ul@@ ela C@@ ampai@@ gn@@ .
I now call up@@ on this Hou@@ se and the citizens and organisations of this Province to nomin@@ ate those - either depar@@ ted or still living - from the ran@@ ks of youth and wo@@ men@@ , who they be@@ li@@ eve are wor@@ th@@ y of the high@@ est hon@@ ours that the Western Cape can bes@@ to@@ w on its citizens so that we can el@@ ev@@ ate their example and hold them up as the sy@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ s of our fre@@ edom and un@@ ity, and the ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ts of our Home for Al@@ l.

A@@ ro@@ un@@ d the wor@@ l@@ d, small businesses are a bi@@ g part of the econom@@ y.
In developed countries small businesses contribu@@ te up to 60@@ %@@ to G@@ D@@ P@@ ; in South Afric@@ a, small businesses only contribu@@ te about 35@@ % to G@@ D@@ P@@ .
Par@@ t of the reas@@ on for this is that com@@ par@@ ed to many si@@ mi@@ lar developing countries like B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and In@@ di@@ a, the sur@@ vi@@ val rate of small businesses in South Africa has been low@@ .
S@@ o has the level of entreprene@@ urs@@ hi@@ p.
Small business support services are b@@ ad@@ ly nee@@ de@@ d@@ ; but histor@@ ic@@ al@@ ly, these have often been fr@@ ag@@ men@@ ted.
In some areas there has been a lo@@ t of du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation of servic@@ es, while in oth@@ ers, especially in the rural areas@@ , there have been no support services at all@@ .
The RED Door advice centres have been established to co-ordin@@ ate support services and make sure they are e@@ asi@@ ly availa@@ ble@@ , when and where they are nee@@ de@@ d.

Al@@ most six weeks ag@@ o the f@@ act that cases of African H@@ or@@ se S@@ ick@@ ness were de@@ tec@@ ted in the Worcester and Robertson distr@@ ic@@ ts of the Western Cape Province was made publi@@ c.
To ensure that the public is k@@ ept inform@@ ed about the status of this disease out@@ bre@@ ak the present situ@@ ation is out@@ lin@@ ed bel@@ ow@@ .
The disease has been diagno@@ sed on six proper@@ ties in the Breede River val@@ ley on the bor@@ der between the Worcester and Robertson distr@@ ic@@ ts.
The diagno@@ sis has been confir@@ med through virus is@@ ol@@ ation and identi@@ fication procedures perform@@ ed on sam@@ ples taken from hor@@ ses that di@@ ed.
The test result from a se@@ ven@@ th property is still aw@@ ai@@ ted.
In total eigh@@ teen hor@@ ses sho@@ w@@ ed c@@ lin@@ ical sign@@ s of the disease and of these eight have di@@ ed and two were put do@@ wn@@ .

And we have done so with perform@@ an@@ ces at the Ba@@ x@@ ter such as V@@ u@@ ma@@ , we are do@@ ing so on Sun@@ day in Gen@@ ad@@ endal by br@@ ing@@ ing to min@@ d f@@ our@@ teen out@@ standing fi@@ g@@ ures out of that sla@@ ve er@@ a - whether they were sla@@ ves or whether they were abo@@ li@@ tion@@ is@@ ts@@ ; whether they were fre@@ ed sla@@ ves or whether they were of the Xhosa communities who ga@@ ve s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary to sla@@ v@@ es.
And so I th@@ ink that this day becomes not only a day of pla@@ s@@ tering over those di@@ visi@@ ons of the pa@@ st@@ , but going into the histor@@ y of the p@@ ast so that we all under@@ stand who we are, l@@ ook each other in the e@@ ye and be able to sa@@ y: "@@ This is who I am@@ .
I want to rela@@ te to you.
I want to em@@ br@@ ace what is common between us, and I want to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what is different between us@@ .@@ "
And I th@@ ink that this is what re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation means for us to@@ da@@ y.
We are all famili@@ ar with the g@@ old that we ex@@ port, we are famili@@ ar with the fr@@ uit@@ s that we ex@@ port, we are famili@@ ar with the w@@ ines that we ex@@ port, and so many other th@@ ings that we ex@@ por@@ t.
And that@@ 's a m@@ assi@@ ve resource that we must ha@@ v@@ e.
Who will ever for@@ get the contribu@@ tion of an Ar@@ ch@@ b@@ ishop Des@@ mond T@@ ut@@ u who@@ , in the 19@@ 70@@ 's and the 19@@ 80@@ 's and through to the 199@@ 0@@ 's st@@ ood out as someone who arti@@ cu@@ lated the pa@@ in of our n@@ ation, whether he led the mar@@ ch in f@@ ron@@ t, whether he pres@@ i@@ ded over fun@@ er@@ als of our you@@ th, or whether he visi@@ ted the pa@@ in of so many people who su@@ ffer@@ ed under ap@@ ar@@ th@@ eid@@ ?
Who will ever for@@ get Ar@@ ch@@ b@@ ishop Des@@ mond T@@ ut@@ u ex@@ hor@@ ting our peop@@ le, not only to str@@ ug@@ g@@ le, but to higher levels of mor@@ ality in that str@@ ug@@ g@@ le as he some@@ times st@@ ood between the inst@@ inc@@ ts of our people to do hor@@ ri@@ ble th@@ ings to those who di@@ d hor@@ ri@@ ble th@@ ings to them@@ ?
And he st@@ ood between them@@ .
Who will ever for@@ get that@@ ?
Who will ever for@@ get that Ar@@ ch@@ b@@ ishop Des@@ mond T@@ ut@@ u ex@@ pres@@ sed at a very cri@@ tical mo@@ ment in our histor@@ y our year@@ ning to be on@@ e, our year@@ ning to be uni@@ ted as a people when he said that we are the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w n@@ ation of Go@@ d@@ ?
Th@@ at is wh@@ at@@ , am@@ ong@@ st other th@@ ings, made Ar@@ ch@@ b@@ ishop Des@@ mond T@@ ut@@ u stand out as a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of what we want to be as a n@@ ation.
Sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ly, there are mo@@ ments which defin@@ e F@@ W de K@@ l@@ er@@ k.
The sem@@ in@@ al mo@@ ment pro@@ bab@@ ly is when he gr@@ ab@@ bed power from P@@ W Bo@@ tha who could not c@@ ross that R@@ ub@@ ic@@ on and he in@@ stead p@@ ick@@ ed up the (@@ indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t@@ ).
The mo@@ ment of jo@@ y when all our he@@ ar@@ ts sur@@ ged ac@@ ross the country when he un@@ ban@@ ned the AN@@ C and other li@@ ber@@ ation mo@@ ve@@ men@@ ts, when he fre@@ ed N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ ela and other political pris@@ on@@ ers.
And we k@@ new at that mo@@ ment that that which we had been str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling for was em@@ in@@ ently pos@@ si@@ ble@@ , at that mo@@ ment.
Th@@ at mo@@ ment when he trans@@ c@@ en@@ ded his own histor@@ y, his own party@@ , his own peop@@ le, to start a process of neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ating a better fu@@ ture for all our peop@@ le.
Th@@ o@@ se are the th@@ ings, which have ear@@ ned him some of the ac@@ co@@ la@@ des that the world has been able to gi@@ v@@ e.
Who will be able to for@@ get N@@ el@@ s@@ on Ro@@ li@@ h@@ la@@ h@@ l@@ a M@@ and@@ el@@ a, his tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ se@@ ven years in pr@@ ison in the Western Cape, in Cape Town@@ ?
When he could not be with us but y@@ et was such a power@@ ful pres@@ ence am@@ ong@@ st us.
When he could not spe@@ ak to us, but spo@@ ke to us in such in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ational ways that k@@ ept us be@@ li@@ ev@@ ing that the fu@@ ture was going to be better than the pres@@ ent.
Th@@ at N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ and@@ el@@ a, who could not mar@@ ch with us, but led us in deci@@ sive ways that k@@ ept us going for@@ ward to this mo@@ ment of vic@@ tory and, this mo@@ ment of pe@@ ace and this mo@@ ment of g@@ lor@@ y that South Africa experi@@ ences in the wor@@ l@@ d.

The aim of P@@ regn@@ ancy Education We@@ ek is to provide pregn@@ ant wo@@ men@@ , their part@@ ners and the bro@@ ader community with the knowledge of how to ensure a safe pregn@@ ancy out@@ come for both the mother and her bab@@ y.
"@@ We focus on sav@@ ing mo@@ thers and bab@@ ies through early boo@@ k@@ ing, early rec@@ ogni@@ tion of d@@ ang@@ er sign@@ s and early intervention " minister Uys sa@@ id@@ .
South Africa and the Western Cape have a high inf@@ ant and ma@@ ternity mor@@ ta@@ lity r@@ ate.

The esti@@ m@@ ated ma@@ ternal mor@@ ta@@ lity rate for South Africa is 17@@ 5 for every 100 000 bir@@ th@@ s.
In the Western Cape the fi@@ g@@ ure is much low@@ er than hal@@ f with 77 ma@@ ternal de@@ ath@@ s for every 100 000 bir@@ th@@ s.
" Th@@ rough awareness weeks such as these we try to low@@ er the mor@@ ta@@ lity rate " says U@@ ys.
M@@ in Uys said women must not only ad@@ ap@@ t to a health@@ ier li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le during pregn@@ anc@@ y, but must also be more c@@ au@@ ti@@ ous then us@@ u@@ al.
H@@ e ga@@ ve the following advice to pregn@@ ant wo@@ men@@ :
* Visi@@ t your nearest clinic or doctor as soon as you suspec@@ t that you may be pregn@@ an@@ t.
* B@@ ook early and atten@@ d regul@@ arly for chec@@ k-@@ up@@ s.
* N@@ ur@@ ture y@@ our@@ self - your nu@@ tri@@ tion is important as are exerc@@ is@@ es during pregn@@ anc@@ y.
* Sub@@ stance abuse eg al@@ cohol and s@@ mo@@ king can har@@ m your un@@ bor@@ n bab@@ y.
A@@ vo@@ id these at all costs during and after the birth of your inf@@ an@@ t.
* K@@ now you and your part@@ n@@ er's HIV status - ask about volun@@ tary HIV counsel@@ ing and testing at your nearest clinic@@ .
* Dis@@ c@@ us@@ s with your local clinic the need for a birth compan@@ ion.
* Dis@@ c@@ us@@ s and plan fe@@ eding op@@ tions with clinic st@@ aff@@ .
* K@@ now the d@@ ang@@ er sign@@ s during pregn@@ ancy and se@@ ek help immedi@@ ately at your local clinic or doctor when these sign@@ s are no@@ ted.
These sign@@ s include:
* ble@@ eding from the v@@ ag@@ ina
* he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es
* bl@@ ur@@ red vision or se@@ e@@ ing star@@ s
* sw@@ ol@@ l@@ en hand@@ s, fe@@ et and/or fac@@ e

Af@@ ter further testing to determine the extent of the out@@ bre@@ ak ac@@ tions to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the disease will be tak@@ en.
The virus that is responsible for this out@@ bre@@ ak has been ty@@ p@@ ed as H@@ 5@@ N@@ 2 and is not related to the virus that has caused disease in h@@ um@@ ans in A@@ si@@ a, E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe and North Africa.

As part of the control measures to prevent the spread of the disease a temporary ban on all mo@@ ve@@ ments of o@@ str@@ ic@@ h@@ es and all types of dom@@ esti@@ c@@ ated p@@ ou@@ l@@ try in the area between the N@@ 2 national road in the south and the Langeberg / Out@@ eni@@ qu@@ a m@@ oun@@ tain ran@@ ges in the nor@@ th and the R@@ 3@@ 23 between the N@@ 2 at Rivers@@ dale and the G@@ ar@@ ci@@ a P@@ as@@ s and the R@@ 3@@ 28 between the N@@ 2 at Hartenb@@ os and the Ro@@ bin@@ s@@ on P@@ as@@ s in the w@@ est and e@@ ast respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.

It is envisaged that@@ , with the full coo@@ per@@ ation of all role pla@@ y@@ ers, the out@@ bre@@ ak will remain con@@ fin@@ ed and that the disease will be eli@@ min@@ ated from the infected foc@@ us.
It must be em@@ ph@@ asi@@ sed that this virus does not affec@@ t h@@ um@@ ans in any way and that all o@@ str@@ ic@@ h and p@@ ou@@ l@@ try products comm@@ er@@ cially available are therefore safe for human consum@@ p@@ tion.

E@@ arly in April 2006 a temporary ban was im@@ posed on the mo@@ vement of hor@@ s@@ es, m@@ ul@@ es, don@@ ke@@ ys and z@@ e@@ br@@ as in the Worcester and Robertson mag@@ ister@@ i@@ al distr@@ ic@@ ts.
The purpose of this ban was to li@@ mit the spread of an out@@ bre@@ ak of African H@@ or@@ se S@@ ick@@ ness on the bor@@ der between these distr@@ ic@@ ts.
S@@ in@@ ce the last case of the disease was diagno@@ sed four weeks ag@@ o Veterinary Services of the Western Cape Department of Agriculture is now in a position to@@ , with effect on Fri@@ day 14 July 2006, lif@@ t the ban@@ .
It must be em@@ ph@@ asi@@ sed that all mo@@ vement of hor@@ ses within and into the African H@@ or@@ se S@@ ick@@ ness control z@@ on@@ es in the Western Cape must still ad@@ here to the pro@@ to@@ co@@ l requirements that have been in place before the ban was institu@@ ted.
The details of these requirements can be obtained from the clo@@ s@@ est State Veter@@ in@@ ari@@ an or the State Veter@@ in@@ ari@@ an, Boland on telephone 021 808 5@@ 02@@ 6 during office h@@ our@@ s.

Wit@@ h the coo@@ per@@ ation of all role pla@@ y@@ ers, and in particular the own@@ ers of hor@@ s@@ es, it was possible to cont@@ ain the out@@ bre@@ ak to a li@@ mited area in the Worcester and Robertson distr@@ ic@@ ts.

6 October 2006
A free poli@@ o immun@@ iz@@ ation c@@ ampaign will swe@@ ep ac@@ ross the province from the 8@@ th to 14@@ th October 2006, when all children under five years of age will be immun@@ iz@@ ed.
Minister Uys ur@@ ge paren@@ ts, guardi@@ an@@ s, car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver@@ s and the general public to take all children under five years to their nearest clinic or Community Health Centre for poli@@ o immun@@ iz@@ ation, ir@@ respective of their immun@@ iz@@ ation stat@@ us.
"@@ Poli@@ o is a high@@ ly infec@@ ti@@ ous disease caused by the poli@@ o@@ virus which affec@@ ts main@@ ly young childr@@ en, but any un@@ immun@@ iz@@ ed person can also get poli@@ o@@ ,@@ " Uys sa@@ id@@ .
Minister Uys laun@@ ch@@ ed the Western Cape Department of Health@@ 's c@@ ampaign in con@@ jun@@ c@@ tion with the City of Cape Town to@@ day at the T@@ afel@@ sig Community Centre@@ .
Appro@@ xim@@ ately 150 children jo@@ in@@ ed him in sy@@ m@@ bo@@ lic@@ ally gi@@ ving poli@@ o a "@@ red car@@ d@@ " to stop its spre@@ ad@@ .
"@@ D@@ uring the immun@@ iz@@ ation c@@ ampaign special ef@@ for@@ ts will be made to bring additional immun@@ iz@@ ation po@@ sts to all clinic@@ s, Community Health Centres and community centres as close to communities as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ ,@@ " Uys sa@@ id@@ .
In addi@@ tion, immun@@ iz@@ ation te@@ ams com@@ pr@@ ised of health care workers will visit day care c@@ enter@@ s, cr@@ Ã¨@@ ches and pre@@ -@@ schools during the c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ .
"@@ Poli@@ o can be preven@@ ted by rou@@ tin@@ ely immun@@ iz@@ ing children against poli@@ o at bir@@ th, 6 week@@ s, 10 week@@ s, 14 weeks and at 18 months free at all public facilities in the provin@@ ce@@ ,@@ " says Dr@@ . I@@ van T@@ om@@ s, Executive Director of City Health@@ .
South Africa has been free of the poli@@ o@@ virus for over 15 years.
Rec@@ ently N@@ am@@ i@@ bi@@ a experi@@ enc@@ ed an out@@ bre@@ ak of poli@@ o ear@@ lier this year after being poli@@ o free for more than ten years.
The national poli@@ o mass immun@@ iz@@ ation c@@ ampaign is conduc@@ ted to give ex@@ tr@@ a poli@@ o dro@@ ps to as many children as pos@@ si@@ ble.
This would prevent the poli@@ o@@ virus from ci@@ r@@ cu@@ lating among un@@ protec@@ ted childr@@ en.
Children under 5 years of age are most vul@@ ner@@ able therefore they are tar@@ ge@@ ted.

WHAT IS A SC@@ HOO@@ L GOVERN@@ ING BO@@ D@@ Y@@ ?
The Schools Act says that all stakeholders in education must acc@@ ept responsibility for the organisation of school@@ s, and poin@@ ts out that parents and members of local communities are often in the best position to know what a school re@@ ally needs and what its problems ar@@ e.
This is wh@@ y every public school must have a govern@@ ing bo@@ d@@ y.
Each School Govern@@ ing Bo@@ dy (S@@ G@@ B) govern@@ s the management of its school@@ .
In a school that is registered as a section 21 compan@@ y, the S@@ G@@ B is also responsible for the school@@ 's fin@@ anc@@ es.
WH@@ O PAR@@ TI@@ CI@@ PA@@ TE@@ S IN THE S@@ G@@ B@@ ?
The S@@ G@@ B consists of@@ :
* the school princi@@ pal
* elected represent@@ atives (@@ paren@@ ts, educ@@ ator@@ s, other staff memb@@ ers, and learners in gr@@ ade 8 or abo@@ v@@ e)
* op@@ tional co-@@ op@@ ted members who do not have the right to vote (for example, members of the commun@@ ity, or the own@@ er of the school proper@@ ty@@ ).
You can repres@@ ent other parents on an S@@ G@@ B if you are nominated and vo@@ ted for by the paren@@ ts.
The majority of vo@@ ting members of the S@@ G@@ B must be paren@@ ts.
The princi@@ pal will provide parents with information about S@@ G@@ B elec@@ tions.
WHAT ARE THE F@@ UN@@ C@@ TION@@ S OF THE S@@ G@@ B@@ ?
The govern@@ ing body must@@ :
* De@@ ci@@ de on an ad@@ mis@@ sions policy for the school@@ .
* De@@ ci@@ de on the language policy of the school@@ .
* De@@ ci@@ de on what relig@@ ious practices will be follow@@ ed at the school@@ .
* Ad@@ op@@ t a co@@ de of conduct for learners which s@@ ets out dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ inary proced@@ ur@@ es.
All these deci@@ sions and policies must be in line with national poli@@ ci@@ es.
The S@@ G@@ B must al@@ so@@ :
* Ad@@ op@@ t a constitution s@@ etting out how the S@@ G@@ B will oper@@ ate.
* Ad@@ op@@ t a school mission state@@ ment s@@ etting out the values and be@@ li@@ ef@@ s of the school@@ .
* De@@ ci@@ de the times of the school da@@ y.
* Ad@@ minister the school@@ 's proper@@ ty, buil@@ dings and groun@@ d@@ s.
* M@@ ake recommend@@ ations regarding the appointment of educ@@ ators at the school@@ .
In addi@@ tion, a govern@@ ing body can be given any of these func@@ tion@@ s:
* main@@ taining and impro@@ ving the school@@ 's proper@@ ty, buil@@ dings and groun@@ ds

THE MAN@@ A@@ GE@@ MENT OF HIV/AIDS IN SC@@ HOO@@ LS
M@@ illi@@ ons of people are infected with HIV and this number is ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly ris@@ ing.
As a resul@@ t, increas@@ ing numbers of learners and educ@@ ators infected with HIV are part of our school@@ s.
People who are infected with HIV fac@@ e dis@@ crimin@@ ation because of their HIV positive stat@@ us.
It is therefore important that all schools have an HIV/AIDS policy to ensure that@@ :
* the rights of all learners and educ@@ ators are respec@@ ted
* learners and educ@@ ators with HIV are man@@ aged appropri@@ ately
* further HIV infec@@ tion is preven@@ ted
* a non-@@ dis@@ crimin@@ atory and car@@ ing learning environment is cre@@ ate@@ d.
A national policy on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools has been dr@@ af@@ ted by the Department of Education for public learning institu@@ tions.
Schools and govern@@ ing bo@@ dies should develop and adop@@ t their own policies in ke@@ eping with the principles in the national polic@@ y.
If a school does not have its own policy this one will automati@@ cally ap@@ pl@@ y.
K@@ no@@ wing your rights as paren@@ ts, educ@@ ators and learners and under@@ standing the principles of the national policy as well as the Constitution will assist you to effecti@@ vely manage HIV/AIDS effecti@@ vely at your school@@ .
CAN HIV PO@@ SI@@ TI@@ VE LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS B@@ E E@@ X@@ C@@ L@@ U@@ DE@@ D F@@ RO@@ M SC@@ HOO@@ L@@ ?
No. The Constitution says that everyone has a right to equ@@ ality and that children have a right to a basic educ@@ ation.
The national policy also st@@ ates that no lear@@ ner may be un@@ fair@@ ly dis@@ crimin@@ ated against and d@@ eni@@ ed ad@@ mission to a school on the basis of his or her HIV stat@@ us.
MA@@ Y LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS WIT@@ H HIV B@@ E TR@@ E@@ ATE@@ D IN A DI@@ FF@@ ER@@ EN@@ T W@@ A@@ Y TO O@@ TH@@ ER LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS@@ ?
Lear@@ ners with HIV should not be d@@ eni@@ ed the opportun@@ ity to re@@ ach their full poten@@ ti@@ al.
Th@@ eir needs should be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dated as f@@ ar as is reason@@ ably possible within the school environment or through home schoo@@ ling if necess@@ ary.
Any special measures taken must be fair@@ , medic@@ ally j@@ usti@@ fi@@ able and taken in consult@@ ation with the lear@@ ner and par@@ ent.
MA@@ Y A SC@@ HOO@@ L DE@@ M@@ AND INFORM@@ ATION A@@ BO@@ U@@ T A LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ER@@ 'S HIV STA@@ TU@@ S@@ ?
No. All medical information is conf@@ identi@@ al and n@@ either parents n@@ or learners have a legal du@@ ty to tel@@ l the school author@@ ities of a learn@@ er's HIV stat@@ us.
S@@ hould this information be volun@@ tar@@ ily dis@@ clo@@ s@@ ed, it must remain conf@@ identi@@ al.
CAN SC@@ HOO@@ LS R@@ OU@@ T@@ IN@@ EL@@ Y TE@@ S@@ T LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS FOR HIV@@ ?
There is no medical or scientific j@@ usti@@ fication for rou@@ tin@@ ely testing learners for HIV@@ .
The testing of learners for HIV as a pr@@ er@@ equi@@ site for ad@@ mission or continu@@ ed atten@@ d@@ ance is pro@@ hibi@@ ted in the National Polic@@ y.
CAN SC@@ HOO@@ LS TE@@ S@@ T LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS FOR HIV WI@@ TH@@ OU@@ T THE@@ I@@ R CON@@ SEN@@ T@@ ?
No person may be tes@@ ted without his or her cons@@ ent.
HOW S@@ HO@@ UL@@ D SC@@ HOO@@ LS P@@ RE@@ V@@ EN@@ T THE R@@ IS@@ K OF HIV TR@@ AN@@ S@@ MIS@@ SI@@ ON IN THE SC@@ HOO@@ L ENVIRON@@ MENT@@ ?
HIV cannot be trans@@ mitted through da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day social contac@@ t.
Al@@ th@@ ough the risk of HIV trans@@ mission in the school is in@@ sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ t, all schools should imple@@ ment uni@@ ver@@ sal prec@@ au@@ tions to prevent the spread of all infec@@ tions trans@@ mitted by bloo@@ d, including HIV@@ .
These prec@@ au@@ tions include the follow@@ ing:
* All bl@@ ood and body f@@ l@@ uid@@ s should be treated as if they are infected with HIV and hand@@ led with ex@@ tre@@ me c@@ au@@ tion.
* L@@ ate@@ x glo@@ ves should be wor@@ n by all persons atten@@ ding to accid@@ ents invol@@ ving bl@@ ood sp@@ ill@@ s.
* All w@@ oun@@ ds should be clean@@ ed with water and dis@@ infec@@ tant immedi@@ ately and cover@@ ed with a water@@ proof d@@ res@@ s@@ ing.
* Sur@@ fac@@ es cont@@ amin@@ ated with bl@@ ood should be clean@@ ed with a ble@@ ach so@@ lu@@ tion.
* All schools should have a minimum of two Fir@@ st Aid k@@ its available and acces@@ si@@ ble.
* L@@ ate@@ x glo@@ ves should be available in every cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ om and at every spor@@ ting even@@ t.
* All learners and educ@@ ators should be provided with information on how to handle bl@@ ood sp@@ ill@@ s.
WHAT A@@ BO@@ U@@ T THE R@@ IS@@ K OF HIV TR@@ AN@@ S@@ MIS@@ SI@@ ON TH@@ R@@ OU@@ G@@ H C@@ ONT@@ AC@@ T SP@@ OR@@ T@@ ?
The risk of HIV trans@@ mission occ@@ ur@@ ring through contact sports is in@@ sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ t.
However, should any ble@@ eding occ@@ ur, the in@@ j@@ ured pla@@ y@@ er should be taken off the field and tre@@ ate@@ d.
The pla@@ y@@ er may res@@ um@@ e pla@@ y once the w@@ ound has been sec@@ ure@@ ly cover@@ ed and so@@ i@@ led clo@@ th@@ es chan@@ ge@@ d.
Lear@@ ners and co@@ ach@@ es with HIV should receive medical counselling before participating in contact spor@@ t.
DO LE@@ AR@@ N@@ ERS HA@@ VE A RI@@ G@@ H@@ T TO RE@@ C@@ E@@ I@@ VE ED@@ UC@@ ATION A@@ BO@@ U@@ T HIV/@@ AID@@ S@@ ?
The National Policy st@@ ates that a continu@@ ing HIV@@ / AIDS education programme should be implemen@@ ted in all school@@ s.
This should be integrated into a Li@@ f@@ e-@@ Skills programme and should be age appropriate and accur@@ ate.
Par@@ ents should be inform@@ ed of this programme.
MA@@ Y C@@ OND@@ OM@@ S B@@ E IS@@ SU@@ ED AT SC@@ HOO@@ L@@ S@@ ?
The National Policy ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that this is a comple@@ x issue and su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that issues such as this are resol@@ ved taking into account the needs and values of the specific school commun@@ ity.
WHAT A@@ BO@@ U@@ T ED@@ UC@@ A@@ TOR@@ S AND O@@ TH@@ ER ST@@ AF@@ F@@ ?
The National Policy on HIV/AIDS applies to both learners and educ@@ ator@@ s.
This means that staff in an educ@@ ational s@@ etting may not be@@ :
* tes@@ ted for HIV without their cons@@ ent.
* tes@@ ted for HIV as a pr@@ er@@ equi@@ site for appointment or continu@@ ed servic@@ e.
* for@@ ced to dis@@ close their HIV stat@@ us.
* dis@@ mis@@ sed or demo@@ ted because of their HIV stat@@ us.
* dis@@ crimin@@ ated in any way because of their HIV stat@@ us.
This is in ke@@ eping with the fair labour practices as set out in the Labour Rel@@ ations Act and the Employ@@ ment E@@ qu@@ ity Ac@@ t.

Ac@@ cur@@ ate information must be provided to learn@@ ers, educ@@ ators and paren@@ ts.
This should be follow@@ ed up with counsel@@ l@@ ing, if necess@@ ary.
The situ@@ ation should be resol@@ ved by the princi@@ pal with the help of the govern@@ ing body if necess@@ ary.
Your school HIV/AIDS policy should include guidel@@ ines on the follow@@ ing:
* N@@ on-@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ation
* Ad@@ mission Policy
* HIV testing
* Prevention of HIV trans@@ mission
* Management of HIV/AIDS
* HIV/AIDS education programmes
* Ref@@ us@@ al to stud@@ y, te@@ ach or work with a person with HIV
WH@@ O S@@ HO@@ UL@@ D B@@ E IN@@ VO@@ L@@ VE@@ D IN DEVELOP@@ ING A SC@@ HOO@@ L PO@@ LIC@@ Y@@ ?
The govern@@ ing body of the school should develop and adop@@ t its own policy in consult@@ ation with the wid@@ er school commun@@ ity.
This could be done through the establish@@ ment of a Health Ad@@ vis@@ ory Committee for the school@@ .
The policy may not de@@ vi@@ ate from the basic principles in the National Policy and should se@@ ek to create an environment in which people with HIV will be treated in a j@@ ust@@ , h@@ um@@ ane and lif@@ e-@@ affir@@ ming wa@@ y.

1 u@@ Mat@@ sh@@ i 2007
'@@ The sec@@ re@@ t weap@@ on against diar@@ r@@ he@@ a is pl@@ en@@ ty of water@@ '@@ , said Minister Uys during a visit to the Delft Community Health C@@ enter@@ .
'@@ Par@@ ents of young children must was@@ h their hand@@ s with so@@ a@@ p and water a few times per day and if their children have diar@@ r@@ he@@ a then lo@@ ts of water would be j@@ ust the right medic@@ in@@ e, said U@@ ys.
Sy@@ mpt@@ oms of diar@@ r@@ he@@ a include:
* P@@ ass@@ ing of a li@@ tt@@ le ur@@ ine
* High body temper@@ ature
* Children who ref@@ use the bre@@ ast or take the bo@@ tt@@ le po@@ or@@ ly
Uys said that during the war@@ m sum@@ mer months and especially during February and Mar@@ ch, the pre@@ val@@ ence of diar@@ r@@ he@@ a is much higher than other times and parents must be vig@@ il@@ ant about their childr@@ en's condi@@ tion.
Minister Pierre Uys said that ap@@ ar@@ t from the medical read@@ in@@ ess of his st@@ aff@@ , they are also conduc@@ ting an awareness c@@ ampaign with increas@@ ed focus on pla@@ ces such as Delf@@ t, Blo@@ ekom@@ bo@@ s, Wal@@ la@@ c@@ ed@@ ene and Khayelits@@ ha@@ .
The awareness c@@ ampaign includes the distribu@@ tion of p@@ amp@@ h@@ let@@ s, information ses@@ sions to mo@@ thers at clinics and radi@@ o adver@@ ts.
In addi@@ tion, hospitals during this time of the year make available more be@@ ds for diar@@ r@@ he@@ a patients and our Red Cro@@ ss Childr@@ en's Hospital is ready to handle the more ac@@ ute cas@@ es.
A sim@@ ple, y@@ et effective re@@ cip@@ e for diar@@ r@@ he@@ a is an e@@ as@@ y su@@ g@@ ar@@ -@@ sal@@ t so@@ lu@@ tion@@ :
* Was@@ h your hand@@ s and holder with so@@ a@@ p and water
* 1 Li@@ ter c@@ le@@ an water
* M@@ i@@ x until the su@@ ga@@ r and sal@@ t has dis@@ sol@@ ved
* G@@ i@@ ve the si@@ ck child the so@@ lution as often as possible
* G@@ i@@ ve the so@@ lution as soon as the child sho@@ ws any symptoms
Minister Uys said that parents do not have to give medic@@ ines to stop diar@@ r@@ he@@ a but can ke@@ ep their children out of the health facilities if they app@@ lied these very si@@ mp@@ le prescri@@ p@@ tions.

The process to change the names was initi@@ ated after a ro@@ un@@ d of community Im@@ bi@@ z@@ o@@ 's last year during which a number of objec@@ tions about the names of these hospitals were ra@@ ised by local commun@@ ities.
F@@ ol@@ low@@ ing the Im@@ bi@@ z@@ o@@ '@@ s, Uys in@@ vi@@ ted com@@ ment on the current names from inter@@ ested parties through new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments.
A number of su@@ g@@ ges@@ tions were received and after further consult@@ ation the Minister deci@@ ded to ren@@ ame the hospitals to the reg@@ ion@@ /@@ town in which they func@@ tion@@ ed.
"@@ I be@@ li@@ eve the majority of the people in the Western Cape would support the name changes as it allow@@ s people to take pri@@ de in their local hospital " says U@@ ys.

WHAT IS THE K@@ HAN@@ Y@@ A PROJEC@@ T@@ ?
The Khany@@ a Project is an initi@@ ative of the Western Cape Education Depart@@ ment, which star@@ ted in April 200@@ 1.
The project loo@@ ks at ways to use information, communication and audi@@ o@@ vis@@ ual technology to improve teach@@ ing and learn@@ ing, or cur@@ riculum delivery in school@@ s.
The aim is that every teach@@ er in the Western Cape will even@@ tu@@ ally use tech@@ no@@ log@@ y, such as compu@@ ters or tele@@ vi@@ sion@@ s, to teach@@ .
This can help alle@@ vi@@ ate the sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of quali@@ fied teach@@ ing staff at many school@@ s.
The project also exp@@ ec@@ ts that learners will be able to use compu@@ ters to learn@@ .
Har@@ d@@ w@@ are in the form of compu@@ ters and software such as compu@@ ter programmes are supp@@ lied to school@@ s.
The implementation depend@@ s on the specific needs of the school@@ .
Al@@ th@@ ough all schools will even@@ tu@@ ally be tar@@ ge@@ ted, the project has initi@@ ally been implemen@@ ted where the need is gre@@ at@@ est and where results are most li@@ kel@@ y to be achiev@@ ed.
The project is therefore foc@@ using on well@@ -@@ man@@ aged schools in poor areas with s@@ ound ac@@ ademi@@ c resul@@ ts, where new technology will make the most differ@@ ence to the li@@ ves of teach@@ ers and lear@@ ners@@ .
The schools are in@@ vi@@ ted to jo@@ in the project when their staff is ready to adop@@ t the tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies and integr@@ ate them into their teach@@ ing practi@@ ces.
The project has done a sur@@ ve@@ y to find out what the technology needs of each school ar@@ e.
Com@@ pu@@ ter net@@ works are established with Inter@@ net con@@ nec@@ tiv@@ ity and audi@@ o@@ vis@@ ual facilities in individual schools an@@ sw@@ ering to their specific educ@@ ational ne@@ ed@@ s.

All accident reports for accid@@ ents outside municipal areas@@ , where there is no criminal case being investig@@ ate@@ d, are k@@ ept with the Depart@@ ment.
S@@ TO@@ P@@ !
If you are involved in an accident that ca@@ uses injur@@ y to or the death of any@@ on@@ e, or which ca@@ uses dam@@ age to property or any anim@@ al, you are required by law to stop your vehic@@ le.
It is a crime not to stop after an accid@@ ent, and you could be fin@@ ed up to R@@ 36@@ ,@@ 000@@ , or sent to pr@@ ison for up to n@@ ine year@@ s, or bo@@ th@@ .
You don@@ 't have to stop or report an accident if you c@@ ras@@ h into a tree and only dam@@ age your own c@@ ar and you y@@ our@@ self are the only one that gets h@@ ur@@ t.
B@@ u@@ t, if you dam@@ age someone el@@ se@@ 's property you must stop and then report the incid@@ ent at the nearest police st@@ ation.
When you st@@ op@@ , you should s@@ wit@@ ch on your ha@@ z@@ ard ligh@@ ts to war@@ n other traffic of the accid@@ ent.

You should also ge@@ t:
* descri@@ p@@ tions of the vehicles
* details of police and traffic officers and amb@@ ul@@ ance person@@ nel

At a later st@@ age@@ , you or your la@@ wy@@ ers may need a copy of the accident report that is fil@@ led out by the polic@@ e.

The police don@@ 't have to be called to the sc@@ ene if no one has been h@@ ur@@ t, but the accident must be re@@ ported - by both dri@@ ver@@ s - at a police station or traffic office within 24 h@@ our@@ s.
You must also s@@ how your dri@@ ver@@ 's lic@@ ence.
If you are h@@ ur@@ t and can@@ 't report the accident immedi@@ ate@@ ly, you must do it as soon as possible and ex@@ pla@@ in wh@@ y there has been a del@@ ay in re@@ porting the accid@@ ent.
It is an off@@ ence not to report an accident in which another person@@ 's property has been dam@@ age@@ d, or in which another person is in@@ j@@ ure@@ d, even if n@@ either of the dri@@ ver@@ s inten@@ ds taking legal ac@@ tion.
DO NO@@ T IN@@ TER@@ F@@ ER@@ E WIT@@ H THE E@@ V@@ ID@@ EN@@ CE
You must NO@@ T dr@@ ink any al@@ cohol or take any dr@@ ug@@ s that have a n@@ ar@@ co@@ tic effect unless it is on doc@@ tor@@ 's or@@ ders.
If the police ask you to go for a medic@@ ation examin@@ ation, you must not dr@@ ink any al@@ cohol or take any dr@@ ug@@ s that have a n@@ ar@@ co@@ tic effect before the examin@@ ation and before you have re@@ ported the accid@@ ent.
If anyone is in@@ j@@ ured in the accid@@ ent, the vehicles may not be mo@@ ved before the police or traffic officer have ar@@ riv@@ ed and said that the vehicles can be mo@@ v@@ ed.
If the accident tot@@ ally b@@ lock the pass@@ age of other vehic@@ l@@ es, the vehicle may be mo@@ ved suff@@ ici@@ ently to al@@ low vehicles to pass@@ , but only after you have clear@@ ly mark@@ ed the vehicle posi@@ tions (for example with ch@@ alk or sp@@ ra@@ y pa@@ in@@ t@@ ).

* a civil claim for dam@@ age to property
* a civil claim for personal injur@@ y.

When you di@@ e, your est@@ ate is divi@@ ded out between your family or the people that you want to have in@@ her@@ it from you.
The est@@ ate consists of your personal property and pos@@ ses@@ sion@@ s, as well as any money or other ass@@ ets ow@@ ed by you.
Who your property is passed on to depend@@ s on whether you have a valid will or no@@ t.
If you have a valid will then the property is divi@@ ded according to your wis@@ h@@ es.
If you die without a will (@@ called in@@ test@@ ate@@ ) then your property will be divi@@ ded up am@@ ong@@ st your immedi@@ ate family according to the laws of in@@ test@@ ate succ@@ es@@ sion.
C@@ RE@@ A@@ TING A V@@ A@@ LI@@ D WI@@ L@@ L
If you are ol@@ der than 16@@ , you can make a will st@@ ating who you want your property to go to when you di@@ e.
For your will to be valid it needs to be made in the pro@@ per way and you need to be ment@@ ally compet@@ ent when you create the will@@ .
This means that you must be able to under@@ stand the con@@ sequ@@ ences of cre@@ ating a will@@ , must be in a reasonable state of min@@ d and re@@ member what you own@@ .
For a will to be valid you must make sure that@@ :
* The will is in writ@@ ing.
* T@@ w@@ o people ol@@ der than 14 wit@@ ness the making of the will (@@ these wit@@ nesses cannot be benef@@ ici@@ aries of the will@@ ).
* You have initi@@ al@@ led every page of the will and signed the last pa@@ ge, in the pres@@ ence of the wit@@ n@@ ess@@ es.
* The wit@@ nesses have initi@@ al@@ led and signed the will@@ .
In your will you can@@ :
* appoint an execu@@ tor
* divi@@ de up your proper@@ ty.
An execu@@ tor is the person that will make sure that your property is divi@@ ded up according to your wis@@ h@@ es, as set out in your will@@ .
The execu@@ tor also sett@@ les your out@@ standing deb@@ ts.
If you don@@ 't choo@@ se an execu@@ tor@@ , the court will appoint some@@ on@@ e, usually a family member to be your execu@@ tor.
You can get a la@@ wy@@ er to help you to dra@@ w up a will or you can get an e@@ as@@ y-@@ to-@@ complete will form from a st@@ ation@@ ary shop@@ .
D@@ Y@@ ING WI@@ TH@@ OU@@ T A WI@@ L@@ L
If you don@@ 't have a valid will when you di@@ e, your property is divi@@ ded up according to the rules set out in the law@@ .
These rules state that@@ :
* A married person@@ 's property is shar@@ ed equ@@ ally by their sp@@ ou@@ se and their childr@@ en.
* The property is divi@@ ded between other family members if there is no sp@@ ou@@ se or children
* If there are no bl@@ ood rel@@ atives then the property is given to the government.
Di@@ ffer@@ ent rules apply under customary law but this results in a situ@@ ation that is tot@@ ally un@@ fair to the wi@@ f@@ e.

Getting a Maintenance Or@@ der
Bo@@ th parents have a legal du@@ ty to support their childr@@ en.
One parent can apply to the Maintenance Court for the other parent to pay support for their childr@@ en.
U@@ su@@ ally a mother will apply for an order against a f@@ ath@@ er.
If the children are not living with the mother or the f@@ ath@@ er, the person who is loo@@ king after them can apply for maintenance from the paren@@ ts.
For example, if a child is living with the gr@@ and@@ paren@@ ts, the gr@@ and@@ parents can apply to get maintenance from the fa@@ ther and the mother of the chil@@ d.
Once there is a court order in@@ struc@@ ting a parent to pay child sup@@ port, it is a criminal off@@ ence not to pa@@ y.
They also deal with applications to get more or to pay less main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e.
This is a long and comp@@ lic@@ ated process and may take some time.
To apply for a maintenance order against the parent of your chil@@ d, you need to:
1. G@@ o to the Maintenance Office at the Maintenance Court in your area to apply for the court or@@ der.
* The name and address of the person against whom the order is being ma@@ de, and the details of where they work
* A photo@@ grap@@ h of the other person (@@ if availa@@ ble@@ )
* Your identity document
* The childr@@ en's birth certific@@ ates
* A letter of atten@@ d@@ ance from the school princi@@ pal for any school@@ -@@ going child
* A copy of the divor@@ ce order (@@ if applic@@ ab@@ le@@ )
* Pro@@ of of your income (@@ like a sal@@ ary or s@@ li@@ p@@ )
* Your pap@@ ers, recei@@ p@@ ts and accoun@@ ts, sho@@ wing all the th@@ ings you must pay every month
2. The maintenance officer will send a sum@@ m@@ ons to the person against whom the order is being made ask@@ ing them to come to the maintenance office on a certain d@@ ate.
3. On the d@@ ate, you and the other party must go to the office to determine how much that person must pay for the childr@@ en.
4. The maintenance officer will help you work out all the th@@ ings you must pay for every month@@ , how much money you ear@@ n and how much money the other parent ear@@ n@@ s.
5. If the person against whom the order is being made says that they are not the parent of the chil@@ d, you need to ask the court to order a pa@@ ternity test@@ .
6. If you ag@@ ree how much the person must pay for the childr@@ en, the maintenance officer will get both of you to sign a pap@@ er called an order of cour@@ t.
This says that the other party must pay the agre@@ ed amount of money every week or every month@@ .
7. If you do not agre@@ e, or if the other person does not come to the office on that d@@ ate, then the officer will sa@@ y your case must go to the Maintenance Cour@@ t.
The court s@@ ends noti@@ ces to both parties telling you both to come to the Maintenance Court on a certain d@@ ate.
8. The mag@@ istr@@ ate will li@@ ste@@ n to both the paren@@ ts@@ ' st@@ ori@@ es.
They will ask both parties to s@@ how how much they ear@@ n and how much they pay every month for th@@ ings like ren@@ t, elec@@ tricity and f@@ oo@@ d.
9. The mag@@ istr@@ ate then deci@@ des how much the other person must pay for the childr@@ en.
The mag@@ istr@@ ate will make this amount an order of cour@@ t, in writ@@ ing.
10@@ . The person against whom the order is being made must pay the maintenance amount every week or month to the maintenance office.
You must then collec@@ t the money from the maintenance office.
For more information contact the maintenance officer at your local Magistrates' Cour@@ t.

En@@ for@@ cing a Maintenance Or@@ der
If the court has or@@ der@@ ed that a parent must pay child sup@@ port, it is a criminal off@@ ence not to pa@@ y.
If the person who has been or@@ der@@ ed to pay maintenance does not pa@@ y, even th@@ ough the court has or@@ der@@ ed them to do so@@ , you need to:
1. G@@ o to the maintenance office and complain@@ .
It is important to make a form@@ al complaint every time when the other parent do@@ es@@ n@@ 't pa@@ y.
2. The maintenance office records each time the other parent pay@@ s.
This record will s@@ how when they do not pay and how much they o@@ we.
3. If the other parent is employed and f@@ ailed to pay main@@ ten@@ ance, you must ask the court to make an order to get the maintenance directly from their employ@@ er.
4. If the other party does not pa@@ y, they are not o@@ be@@ ying the order of cour@@ t.
This is a cri@@ me.
The court will send them a notice telling them to come to court on a certain d@@ ate.
They must then ex@@ pla@@ in wh@@ y they di@@ d not pay the mon@@ e@@ y.

Bo@@ ys under 18 and gi@@ r@@ ls under 15 cannot get married without special per@@ mission and anyone under the age of 21 has to get their paren@@ ts@@ ' per@@ mission before they can get marri@@ ed.
A marriage contrac@@ ted without the required consent is vo@@ id@@ ab@@ le.
This means that it can be declared n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id by the High Cour@@ t.
The parents or guardi@@ an can apply to the High Court for a declaration vo@@ iding the marri@@ age.
This application needs to be ma@@ de:
* before the min@@ or tur@@ ns 21
* within six weeks of fin@@ ding out about the marri@@ age.

If one parent has been granted so@@ le guardi@@ an@@ ship of the min@@ or, only that par@@ ent@@ 's written consent is required on form BI-@@ 3@@ 2.
If the min@@ or is in the care of a legal guardi@@ an, only the guardi@@ an@@ 's written consent (@@ BI-@@ 3@@ 2) is necess@@ ary.
If a parent who@@ se consent is leg@@ ally required cannot be found to grant cons@@ ent, or is leg@@ ally in@@ compet@@ ent to do so@@ , you can apply to a commissioner of child wel@@ f@@ are for consent to the marri@@ age.

This ends the marriage and the divor@@ ced parties can leg@@ ally mar@@ ry again@@ .
The divor@@ ce process will dep@@ end on whether the marriage is a civil marriage or a customary marri@@ age.
Civi@@ l marri@@ ages are dis@@ sol@@ ved according to the rules and procedures set out in the Di@@ vor@@ ce Ac@@ t.
Mar@@ ri@@ ages in terms of African C@@ ust@@ om@@ ary Law are dis@@ sol@@ ved according to the civil law but some of the con@@ sequ@@ ences are determined by cust@@ om and tradi@@ tion.
M@@ us@@ li@@ m and H@@ ind@@ i marri@@ ages are dis@@ sol@@ ved in terms of the ri@@ tes and rit@@ u@@ als of the relig@@ ion.
There are a number of issues that need to be addres@@ sed in a divor@@ ce, including
C@@ US@@ TO@@ D@@ Y OF THE CHI@@ LD@@ RE@@ N
Be@@ fore the court will issue a divor@@ ce, it has to be deci@@ ded who will l@@ ook after the childr@@ en.
The parents can make an agreement or the court can deci@@ de.
The most important consider@@ ation in deci@@ ding which parent should have cu@@ sto@@ dy is the best interests of the childr@@ en.
The Family Ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate at the court can help investigate which parent is in the best position to l@@ ook after the children and will repres@@ ent the children in the court if necess@@ ary.
If the divor@@ ce is taking a long ti@@ me, for example if the parties don@@ 't agre@@ e, then an inter@@ im cu@@ sto@@ dy order can be issued s@@ etting out who will l@@ ook after the children while the divor@@ ce is being fin@@ alis@@ ed.
In Afric@@ an, H@@ ind@@ u and M@@ us@@ li@@ m customary marri@@ ag@@ es, the wi@@ fe usually takes cu@@ sto@@ dy of the childr@@ en.
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to African customary law@@ , the fa@@ ther usually remain@@ s the childr@@ en's natural guardi@@ an@@ .
The children of H@@ ind@@ u and M@@ us@@ li@@ m marri@@ ages are regar@@ ded as il@@ leg@@ iti@@ m@@ ate, so the mother is also the natural guardi@@ an@@ .
In all cas@@ es, the fa@@ ther still has a du@@ ty to support the childr@@ en.
AC@@ C@@ ESS TO THE CHI@@ LD@@ RE@@ N
The parent who does not get cu@@ sto@@ dy will usually still want to see their childr@@ en.
There therefore needs to be an agreement about wh@@ en, where and how this parent will have access to the childr@@ en.
If it is not in the best interests of the children for the other parent to have access righ@@ ts, then the court can res@@ tr@@ ict acc@@ ess.
MA@@ IN@@ TEN@@ AN@@ CE
When a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le gets divor@@ c@@ ed, one party is often in a better financial position than the oth@@ er.
The person who has cu@@ sto@@ dy of the children will also have exp@@ ens@@ es that the other parent does not ha@@ v@@ e.
The court will issue a maintenance order requi@@ ring maintenance to be paid for the children and, dep@@ ending on the circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es, to the other party@@ .
Maintenance for the children is paid to the parent who has cu@@ sto@@ dy (@@ but it is important to re@@ member that this is the child's right and not the par@@ ent@@ '@@ s@@ ).
All parents have a du@@ ty to support their childr@@ en, including children who are il@@ leg@@ iti@@ m@@ ate.
If there are problems with maintenance after the divor@@ ce has g@@ one through@@ , these can be taken to the Maintenance officer at the Magistr@@ ates Cour@@ t.
W@@ he@@ ther one party will have to pay maintenance or support to the other party depend@@ s on the circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
If the parties cannot ag@@ ree on how much should be paid then the court will deci@@ de.
B@@ ec@@ ause H@@ ind@@ u or M@@ us@@ li@@ m marri@@ ages are not fully recogn@@ ised as legal marri@@ ag@@ es, the wi@@ fe has no legal status to claim support after divor@@ ce.
DI@@ V@@ ID@@ ING U@@ P PRO@@ PER@@ TY
How the family property will be divi@@ ded up depend@@ s on what property reg@@ i@@ me the c@@ ou@@ p@@ le adopted when they go@@ t marri@@ ed.
This will usually be cover@@ ed in the an@@ te-@@ n@@ up@@ tial agreement if there is one or, if there is no pre@@ -@@ mar@@ ital contrac@@ t, then it is determined by law@@ .
The de@@ fa@@ ult legal position is that civil marri@@ ages are in community of property with acc@@ r@@ u@@ al.
This means that ever@@ y@@ thing that you own is shar@@ ed, including property and deb@@ ts.
Ac@@ cr@@ ual means that ever@@ y@@ thing that you ear@@ n or bu@@ y after you have married also becomes part of the jo@@ int est@@ ate.
If you get divor@@ c@@ ed, the shar@@ ed property is divi@@ ded equ@@ ally between you.
Any deb@@ ts are also shar@@ ed.
If you sign an an@@ te-@@ n@@ up@@ tial agree@@ ment, you can choo@@ se to get marri@@ ed@@ :
* in community of property
* out of community of property without acc@@ r@@ ual
* out of community of property with acc@@ r@@ u@@ al.
If the marriage is out of community of property without acc@@ r@@ u@@ al, then each person ke@@ ep@@ s their own property from before the marriage and ke@@ ep@@ s wh@@ ate@@ ver they ear@@ n or ac@@ qui@@ re during the marri@@ age.
If the marriage is out of community of property with acc@@ r@@ ual then each person ke@@ ep@@ s their own property from before the marriage but any@@ thing that is acc@@ um@@ ula@@ ted during the marriage is shar@@ ed.
Some th@@ ings, like in@@ her@@ it@@ an@@ ces or gi@@ f@@ ts remain separ@@ ate.
The de@@ fa@@ ult property reg@@ i@@ me has chan@@ ged for different people at different ti@@ m@@ es.
The laws that were in place when you go@@ t married will determine what property reg@@ i@@ me applies to your marri@@ age.
DI@@ S@@ SO@@ L@@ V@@ ING A CI@@ VI@@ L M@@ AR@@ RI@@ AG@@ E
A civil marriage needs to be dis@@ sol@@ ved by a cour@@ t.
Gro@@ un@@ ds for divor@@ ce
You can only get a divor@@ ce if you s@@ how the court that there has been an "@@ ir@@ re@@ tri@@ ev@@ able bre@@ ak@@ do@@ wn@@ " of the marriage or that one of the sp@@ ou@@ ses is ment@@ ally ill or continu@@ ously un@@ cons@@ ci@@ ou@@ s.
I@@ r@@ re@@ tri@@ ev@@ able bre@@ ak@@ down means that the c@@ ou@@ p@@ le can no longer live together and there is no reasonable ch@@ ance of them resol@@ ving their differ@@ enc@@ es.
Pro@@ of of this can include evidence sho@@ wing that@@ :
* The c@@ ou@@ p@@ le have not li@@ ved together for a wh@@ i@@ le.
* One part@@ ner ch@@ e@@ ated on the oth@@ er.
* One part@@ ner le@@ f@@ t the oth@@ er.
* One part@@ ner ab@@ used the oth@@ er.
* The c@@ ou@@ p@@ le no longer lo@@ ve each oth@@ er.
You can get a divor@@ ce if your part@@ ner has been institu@@ tion@@ alised for mental illness for at least two years and doc@@ tors don@@ 't th@@ ink that they will ever rec@@ over@@ .
You can get divor@@ ced if your part@@ ner has been un@@ cons@@ ci@@ ous for at least six months and doc@@ tors don@@ 't be@@ li@@ eve that they will ever rec@@ over@@ .
The divor@@ ce process
If you want to ask the court to issue a divor@@ ce you need to prepar@@ e a sum@@ m@@ ons de@@ aling with@@ :
* Who will have cu@@ sto@@ dy of the childr@@ en.
* How the parent who does not have cu@@ sto@@ dy will access the childr@@ en.
* Who will receive main@@ ten@@ ance, how much it will be and how and when it will be pa@@ id@@ .
* How your property will be divi@@ ded up@@ .
If you and your part@@ ner can re@@ ach a sett@@ lement agreement before the sum@@ m@@ ons is issu@@ ed, this will make the process much qu@@ ic@@ ker and e@@ asi@@ er.
If you re@@ ach an agree@@ ment, you should w@@ ri@@ te it down and sign it.
This consent pap@@ er should then be att@@ ached to the divor@@ ce sum@@ mon@@ s.
A he@@ aring date will be s@@ et.
At this he@@ ar@@ ing, the judge will ask ques@@ tions to confir@@ m the information in the sum@@ mon@@ s.
Once ever@@ y@@ thing is sett@@ le@@ d, a divor@@ ce order will be gran@@ ted.
If you use the Family Court in@@ stead of a High Court your divor@@ ce may go through more qu@@ ick@@ ly and more ch@@ e@@ ap@@ ly.
DI@@ S@@ SO@@ L@@ V@@ ING A M@@ AR@@ RI@@ AG@@ E IN TER@@ M@@ S OF AFRIC@@ AN C@@ US@@ TO@@ M@@ ARY LA@@ W
C@@ ust@@ om@@ ary marri@@ ages are si@@ mi@@ lar to civil marri@@ ages in that the court must issue the divor@@ ce order and the divor@@ ce will only be granted if there are groun@@ ds for divor@@ ce (@@ that is ir@@ re@@ tri@@ ev@@ able bre@@ ak@@ do@@ wn@@ , mental illness or continu@@ ous un@@ cons@@ ci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess@@ ).
The parties can decide the terms of the divor@@ ce and then the judge will issue the relevant orders regarding cu@@ sto@@ dy and main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e.
If the court has to decide on these matters it will take into account any arran@@ ge@@ ments that may have been made in terms of customary law@@ .
The wi@@ fe@@ 's family may have to return all or part of the lo@@ b@@ ol@@ a to the h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ 's fam@@ il@@ y, unless the h@@ us@@ b@@ and public@@ ly re@@ jec@@ ted his wi@@ fe for no reas@@ on at all@@ .

SO@@ UR@@ C@@ E: Department of Local Government (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
The Department of Local Government in the Western Cape as part of our mand@@ ate to streng@@ th@@ en, monitor and capac@@ it@@ ate local government with a focus on develop@@ mental local govern@@ ment, has in@@ vi@@ ted district municipalities to nomin@@ ate candid@@ ates for the first ever burs@@ ary awar@@ ded by this depart@@ ment.
The aim of the bursaries is to make it possible for previously disadvantaged municipal offici@@ als to under@@ take tertiary stu@@ dies in the field of Development Man@@ age@@ ment.
It is with pri@@ de that I can ann@@ oun@@ ce that the first ever re@@ cip@@ i@@ ent of the burs@@ ary for par@@ t-@@ time stud@@ y for a M@@ P@@ HI@@ L in S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able Development has been awar@@ ded to Mr R@@ al@@ p@@ h Lin@@ ks from the Central Karoo District Municipali@@ ty.
Mr Lin@@ ks already took up his burs@@ ary and com@@ men@@ ced his stu@@ dies during February 200@@ 4.
This initi@@ ative is part of a depart@@ mental programme to fo@@ ster skills in develop@@ mental stu@@ dies in the local government spher@@ e.
It is in our common interest that form@@ er@@ ly disadvantaged municipal offici@@ als receive the necessary training and to equi@@ p them with the necessary skills to benefit local government in the Western Cape.
Wit@@ h inter@@ ven@@ tions, such as bursaries for further tertiary stu@@ dies and exten@@ sive training certificate cour@@ ses aimed at management of municipalities with specific focus on f@@ em@@ ale mid@@ d@@ le@@ /@@ senior level municipal offici@@ al@@ s, municipal management train@@ ees and potential municipal management train@@ ees to achi@@ eve demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c represent@@ ativ@@ ity the Department of Local Government has taken the responsibility to ensure that this go@@ al is achiev@@ ed.
This is part of our common ef@@ for@@ ts and is reflec@@ ted in my Ministry and Depart@@ ment's Visi@@ on, which is "@@ Develop@@ mental Local Government through Par@@ t@@ nershi@@ ps and Co@@ -@@ responsibi@@ li@@ ty@@ "@@ .

State@@ ment by Minister of Agriculture on Su@@ spec@@ ted A@@ vi@@ an Inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a
5 August 2004
Su@@ spec@@ ted A@@ vi@@ an Inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a - Western Cape Al@@ er@@ t
The National Department of Agriculture inform@@ ed us that three o@@ str@@ ic@@ h f@@ arms in the C@@ rad@@ o@@ ck@@ -, Somerset East Reg@@ ion in the E@@ astern Cape re@@ ported serious mor@@ ta@@ lities ap@@ par@@ ently due to A@@ vi@@ an Inf@@ lu@@ enz@@ a (@@ bir@@ d flu@@ ).
On requ@@ es@@ t, sam@@ ples were sent to the Western Cape Veter@@ in@@ ari@@ an Lab@@ or@@ ator@@ ies and were provi@@ sion@@ ally diagno@@ sed as the high pa@@ tho@@ gen@@ ic A@@ I (@@ which caused maj@@ or mor@@ ta@@ lities in the East early in 2004@@ ).
The diagno@@ sis has not been confir@@ med y@@ et.
As the disease could pose a serious th@@ re@@ at to the export of o@@ str@@ ic@@ h me@@ at from the O@@ str@@ ic@@ h Ex@@ ports Ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s in the Western Cape, we have requ@@ ested the E@@ astern Cape, not to send bir@@ ds for sla@@ u@@ gh@@ tering to the Western Cape, until we have more c@@ lar@@ ity on the infec@@ tion.
The E@@ U will immedi@@ ately re@@ vo@@ ke our export status should the disease spread to the Western Cape.
A me@@ eting between the N@@ D@@ A and the Department of Agriculture in the E@@ astern Cape was held on Mond@@ a@@ y, 2 August 2004 at B@@ is@@ ho@@ , in order to disc@@ us@@ s the situ@@ ation and it was confir@@ med that a ban was put on the mo@@ vement of o@@ str@@ ic@@ h@@ es from the E@@ astern Cape to the Western Cape.
By the end of this week we should have a much clear@@ er p@@ ic@@ ture of the type of virus concerned as well as the extent of the infec@@ tions in the Western Cape.
O@@ ur most important pri@@ ority is to protect the O@@ str@@ ic@@ h Industry of the Western Cape.
It was therefore necessary to eng@@ age with dis@@ aster management in the Province and all systems were put in place with road contro@@ ls and mo@@ vement monitoring in the Karoo and Oudtshoorn areas.

A histor@@ ical mo@@ ment in the li@@ ves of the farm worker community is taking place on 17 and 18 August 200@@ 4.
For the first time an opportun@@ ity has been cre@@ ated for the farm worker community to enter into a di@@ al@@ og@@ ue with ro@@ le@@ -@@ pla@@ y@@ ers in Agriculture in order to become full part@@ ners in m@@ app@@ ing out the fu@@ ture of Agriculture@@ .
For much to@@ o long disc@@ us@@ sion ab@@ ou@@ t, for and on behalf of farm workers took pla@@ ce.
As Minister of Agriculture@@ , I took the initi@@ ative to call a farm workers indaba on 17 and 18 August 2004 at Elsenburg with the aim of af@@ for@@ ding the farm worker community the opportun@@ ity to come to the table to t@@ alk for them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
The indaba will act as a poin@@ t of depar@@ ture in a bi@@ g@@ ger process in the interest of the farm worker commun@@ ity.
The aim of the indaba is to al@@ low the farm worker community and the different Government struc@@ tur@@ es, N@@ GO@@ '@@ s, Organis@@ ed Agriculture and oth@@ ers to enter into disc@@ us@@ sions in a sp@@ i@@ ri@@ t of re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation to determine the ga@@ p between the service provi@@ ders and the us@@ ers.
Government departments will have the opportun@@ ity to intro@@ duce their policy fr@@ ame@@ works and services.
On the other hand@@ , farm workers will be able to ra@@ ise their need for services and high@@ light the issues of concer@@ n@@ .
Th@@ us the them@@ e: Farm worker in di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e.
T@@ op@@ ics such as rural educ@@ ation@@ ; economic em@@ power@@ ment@@ ; viol@@ ence and saf@@ et@@ y@@ ; social structures and sport@@ ; the value of labour legisl@@ ation@@ ; hou@@ sing@@ ; health@@ ; wo@@ men@@ ; children and dis@@ abled persons will be on the ag@@ en@@ da@@ .
The end res@@ ult@@ : F@@ arm@@ workers in Ac@@ tion.

Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives of Te@@ ac@@ her@@ , Govern@@ ing Bo@@ dy and Stu@@ d@@ ent Organisations
I want to th@@ ank the many learners and parents who were able to atten@@ d at sh@@ ort notice such a jo@@ y@@ ous occ@@ asion@@ .
I am sure the parents of the learners who were contac@@ ted y@@ es@@ ter@@ day by the department must have been very an@@ x@@ ious and pro@@ u@@ d to he@@ ar they had been in@@ vi@@ ted to the Premi@@ er's resid@@ ence.
Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations to all our Ma@@ tric@@ ul@@ ants who have pass@@ ed.
You have made all of us pro@@ ud@@ , your parents and the communities you represent@@ .
For those who were not success@@ ful@@ , this is not the end of the wor@@ l@@ d.
I want to encour@@ age you to en@@ rol for the sup@@ ple@@ mentary examin@@ ation before 18 January 200@@ 5.
U@@ se every day you have to improve your sk@@ ill@@ s.
Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er, work part ti@@ me, re@@ ad, teach@@ , lear@@ n and dis@@ co@@ ver every w@@ ak@@ ing h@@ our@@ .
A new da@@ wn is ris@@ ing over us, over you and Africa.
T@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w will be better than y@@ es@@ ter@@ da@@ y.
And to@@ da@@ y, in these be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful g@@ ard@@ ens of L@@ ee@@ u@@ wen@@ ho@@ f, where sla@@ ves to@@ i@@ led for their mas@@ ter@@ s, we now hold the light which gi@@ ves us h@@ op@@ e.
This year the Western Cape achiev@@ ed an 85@@ % pas@@ s r@@ ate.
However, my Ministry is fully aw@@ are that the to@@ p perform@@ ers have histor@@ ically emer@@ ged from advantaged commun@@ ities.
These learners have done the Western Cape pro@@ ud@@ .
F@@ ur@@ th@@ er, we re@@ ali@@ z@@ e that the pas@@ s rate f@@ ails to reflec@@ t the high per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of learners who dro@@ p out due lar@@ gel@@ y through soci@@ o-@@ economic fac@@ tors before they re@@ ach ma@@ tric@@ .
Hulle is die lig wat br@@ and en noo@@ it d@@ ood@@ gaan nie.
In order to meet the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous chall@@ eng@@ es we fac@@ e in educ@@ ation, the department will se@@ ek part@@ nershi@@ ps with la@@ bour@@ , busin@@ ess, local govern@@ ment, N@@ GO@@ 's and other social part@@ ners@@ .
We re@@ ali@@ z@@ e schools cannot oper@@ ate in a vac@@ u@@ um and require wi@@ der, sustain@@ ed sup@@ por@@ t.
The new l@@ ook Western Cape Education F@@ ound@@ ation, which will be laun@@ ch@@ ed next year@@ , will bl@@ end this part@@ nership into a re@@ al vehicle for transform@@ ation, equ@@ ity and quali@@ ty.
Ar@@ gu@@ ably the Western Cape government has been ha@@ un@@ ted by the spec@@ tr@@ e of ap@@ ar@@ theid for longer than other provin@@ c@@ es, which has required my Ministry to chall@@ en@@ ge a de@@ ep@@ ly entr@@ en@@ ch@@ ed status qu@@ o@@ .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in a sh@@ ort sp@@ ace of time the Department of Education has initi@@ ated the following inter@@ ven@@ tion@@ s:
* St@@ abili@@ z@@ ed the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion by ob@@ taining additional funding from the provincial tre@@ as@@ ur@@ y, to sa@@ ve 1,@@ 8@@ 00 teach@@ ing po@@ sts and em@@ plo@@ y 36@@ 5 more teach@@ ers next year.
I want to the th@@ ank the Premi@@ er, ME@@ C Bro@@ wn and my Minister@@ , Minister N@@ al@@ ed@@ i P@@ and@@ or, for their support in what was a diffic@@ ult time.
* L@@ aid the basis to increase the number of ma@@ ths H@@ G pass@@ es from 4@@ ,@@ 000 this year to 8@@ ,@@ 000 in 200@@ 9.
* Ini@@ ti@@ ated a land au@@ dit of un@@ u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ed education property for possible ali@@ en@@ ation to gener@@ ate additional fun@@ ds to build the 65 schools we ne@@ ed, f@@ as@@ ter.
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e, the Western Cape Education Department is commit@@ ted to impro@@ ving perform@@ ance, en@@ han@@ cing accoun@@ t@@ ability by do@@ ing the follow@@ ing:
* Mak@@ ing sure that ac@@ tual teach@@ ing star@@ ts in all schools on 19 January 200@@ 5, the day school star@@ ts, and we will clo@@ sel@@ y monitor the quality of tui@@ tion in schools at risk
* Re@@ de@@ ploy@@ ing some of our district and head office st@@ aff@@ , including circ@@ uit man@@ ag@@ ers, so that they will be op@@ ti@@ m@@ ally used and held accoun@@ table
* Re@@ view@@ ing the results of gr@@ ade 8 to 11 to ensure through@@ put and ensure that the areas of ma@@ th@@ s, sci@@ ence and accoun@@ ting are pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ sed
* A@@ lig@@ ning our human resource strategy so that it sup@@ ports all b@@ and@@ s of education and develop@@ s learners with knowle@@ d@@ ge, sk@@ ill@@ s, values and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des to contribu@@ te to the provincial econom@@ y, fi@@ gh@@ ting p@@ over@@ ty and cre@@ ating work
* M@@ ake sure every high school has a compu@@ ter la@@ b by the end of next year@@ , and in part@@ nership with M@@ ulti@@ -@@ C@@ ho@@ ic@@ e, equi@@ p our schools with a s@@ at@@ te@@ li@@ te di@@ sh@@ , tele@@ vision and V@@ C@@ R s@@ et.
I have asked each may@@ or to consi@@ der the alloc@@ ation of a burs@@ ary or cas@@ h pri@@ z@@ e for the best over@@ all ma@@ tric@@ ul@@ ant in their municipali@@ ty, as well as to the best ma@@ th@@ s, sci@@ ence and accoun@@ t@@ ancy higher gr@@ ade learners from histor@@ ically disadvantaged schools in their town@@ s.
I would like to th@@ ank those Ma@@ y@@ ors who have already taken up my requ@@ est@@ .
There is much to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate.
A sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant number of our schools have increas@@ ed the number of learners who passed the Senior Certificate from 2003 to 200@@ 4.
In some schools the numbers have increas@@ ed by more than 30 lear@@ ners@@ .
This year has se@@ en more learners en@@ rol@@ led for the Senior Certificate examin@@ ation: 38@@ ,@@ 8@@ 9@@ 6 - which is an impro@@ vement on the last two years.
The further good ne@@ ws is that@@ , alth@@ ough our per@@ c@@ ent@@ age pas@@ s rate of 85@@ % for 2004 repres@@ ents a s@@ light dro@@ p of 2,@@ 1@@ % com@@ par@@ ed to 200@@ 3, all indi@@ cations are that the quality of our education is ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly impro@@ v@@ ing.
The number of candid@@ ates achiev@@ ing end@@ or@@ se@@ ment, increas@@ ed from 10@@ ,@@ 3@@ 23 last year@@ , to 10@@ ,@@ 5@@ 24 this year - which is an increase of 2@@ 01 lear@@ ners@@ .
The number of candid@@ ates who passed with Dis@@ t@@ inc@@ tion, which is an ag@@ g@@ reg@@ ate of more than 80@@ %@@ , increas@@ ed from 2,@@ 1@@ 70 to 2,@@ 20@@ 2 - which is an increase of 23 lear@@ ners@@ .
Premi@@ er, there are also some good ne@@ ws on the sub@@ jects of ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs and sci@@ ence.
In 2003 we had 3@@ ,@@ 93@@ 8 candid@@ ates who passed ma@@ ths on the higher gr@@ ade@@ .
This year we have increas@@ ed it to 4@@ ,@@ 2@@ 68@@ , which is an increase of 3@@ 30 lear@@ ners@@ .
In 2003 we had 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 9@@ 2 learners who passed physical sci@@ ences on the higher gr@@ ade@@ .
This year we have increas@@ ed it to 3@@ ,@@ 93@@ 7, which is an increase of 45 lear@@ ners@@ .
This confir@@ ms that the standards of our education is high@@ , and chall@@ eng@@ es the no@@ tion that only a well@@ -@@ resour@@ ced school is capable of deliver@@ ing quality educ@@ ation.
The school@@ s, which have contribu@@ ted to the increas@@ es in numbers on the quality indic@@ ator@@ s, are from the enti@@ re spec@@ tr@@ um of school types - form@@ er mo@@ del C school@@ s, form@@ er Hou@@ se of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives and form@@ er DE@@ T@@ .
In this respect the number of end@@ or@@ se@@ ments from form@@ er DE@@ T schools has ris@@ en from 2@@ 70 in 2003 to 39@@ 0 in 2004 and the number of higher gr@@ ade ma@@ ths candid@@ ates from 78 to 13@@ 6.
W@@ el ged@@ aan@@ !
An increas@@ ing number of form@@ er mo@@ del C schools have al@@ so@@ , via ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ s, op@@ ened their d@@ oor@@ s to lar@@ ge numbers of Col@@ ou@@ red and African learners and have continu@@ ed to achi@@ eve out@@ standing resul@@ ts.
H@@ ere I wish to men@@ tion the S@@ ans Sou@@ c@@ i G@@ ir@@ l@@ s@@ ' High Schoo@@ l, which has achiev@@ ed over 75@@ % end@@ or@@ se@@ ment rate over three years.
This school@@ , which will be hon@@ ou@@ red later has 46 Col@@ ou@@ red ma@@ tric@@ s, 5 Whi@@ te, 18 African and 12 In@@ di@@ an@@ .
M@@ y L@@ ati@@ n tel@@ ls me that S@@ ans Sou@@ c@@ i means without equ@@ al.
The opportun@@ ity you have given black f@@ em@@ ale learners is in@@ de@@ ed wor@@ th@@ y of em@@ ul@@ ation.
In this respect I also want to men@@ tion the ef@@ for@@ ts of S@@ ett@@ l@@ ers and P@@ inelands High school@@ s.
I am also pro@@ u@@ d of the achiev@@ e@@ ments of schools such as Har@@ ry G@@ w@@ al@@ a, Ho@@ Ã@@ r@@ skool Roberts@@ on, Ho@@ Ã@@ r@@ skool Ladis@@ mi@@ th, Aug@@ s@@ burg Landbou G@@ im@@ n@@ asi@@ um, Groo@@ t B@@ rak@@ rivier Ho@@ Ã@@ r@@ skool@@ , Swart@@ berg Sek@@ ond@@ Ã@@ @@ r en Di@@ az@@ ville Ho@@ Ã@@ r@@ skool@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ for@@ e, to@@ day we not only c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the achiev@@ e@@ ments of the candid@@ ates and school@@ s, but also pay tribu@@ te to the prin@@ cip@@ al@@ s, the teach@@ ers and all our commun@@ iti@@ es, for their contribu@@ tion towards gro@@ wing the Western Cape as a Learning Home for All our Childr@@ en.
Premi@@ er, this is a tan@@ gi@@ ble reflec@@ tion of the commit@@ ment of the WC@@ ED and our communities to your call for this province to be a Home for Al@@ l.
This year the WC@@ ED has ch@@ os@@ en to re@@ ward impro@@ vement or consist@@ ency of performance while main@@ taining or increas@@ ing G@@ rade 12 en@@ rol@@ ment level@@ s.
As it is our inten@@ tion to ensure that learners continue through to G@@ rade 12, lear@@ ner numbers in Gr@@ ades 8 to 11 over the previous four years will be trac@@ k@@ ed.
All school@@ s, including independent school@@ s, en@@ tering candid@@ ates for the Senior Certificate examin@@ ation of the WC@@ ED were e@@ lig@@ i@@ ble for awar@@ d@@ s.
B@@ ut Mr B@@ ri@@ an Sch@@ re@@ u@@ der from my department will ex@@ pla@@ in all of that to you.
In addi@@ tion, the S@@ G will hon@@ our a new school in Kraaifontein who have tr@@ ul@@ y, in two sh@@ ort year@@ s, made gre@@ at str@@ id@@ es towards quali@@ ty.
O@@ ur stud@@ ents in Khayelitsha have sho@@ wn impro@@ ve@@ ment.
Qu@@ ality is no longer the so@@ le pres@@ erve of a few school@@ s.
I must also men@@ tion to you that@@ , this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on, the Pres@@ identi@@ al no@@ dal z@@ one of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha will pla@@ y ho@@ st at the Ro@@ ck@@ lands Civic Centre in Mitchell's Plain for an ev@@ ent to hon@@ our their to@@ p achi@@ ever@@ s.
As men@@ tion@@ ed, I have also asked our Ma@@ y@@ ors in the different municipalities to do the same in the new year.
We are c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating to re@@ war@@ d, but also to encour@@ age our learners to continue their education in FE@@ T Col@@ leg@@ es, Tech@@ ni@@ k@@ ons or Uni@@ versi@@ ties.
I have therefore appro@@ ached various le@@ ading corpor@@ ate citizens to assist with govern@@ ment's ef@@ for@@ ts in building a learning home for all our childr@@ en, by providing pro@@ mis@@ ing ma@@ tric@@ s with financial assistance who want to enter the fiel@@ ds of sci@@ ence, ma@@ ths and tech@@ no@@ log@@ y.
SA@@ IC@@ SA@@ , E@@ T@@ V@@ , Ch@@ ec@@ kers Sh@@ op@@ ri@@ te, M@@ aster Ma@@ th@@ s, ME@@ C@@ ER compu@@ ters are but some who have respon@@ ded to our c@@ all@@ .
I want to th@@ ank them for do@@ ing so@@ .
I am loo@@ king for@@ ward to the chall@@ eng@@ es of 200@@ 5, to work with our school@@ s, teach@@ ers and paren@@ ts, govern@@ ing bo@@ dies and un@@ ion@@ s, to continue impro@@ ving the quality of education in this province.
We have a vision - a home for all@@ .
We have a plan - iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o and our job as education is to develop the H@@ R@@ D strategy to imple@@ ment the plan and ful@@ fi@@ l the vi@@ sion.
To@@ ge@@ ther we cannot f@@ ail@@ .
Afric@@ an, Col@@ ou@@ re@@ d, Whi@@ te and In@@ di@@ an, m@@ en and wo@@ men@@ , Chris@@ ti@@ an, H@@ in@@ du@@ , M@@ us@@ li@@ m and J@@ ew@@ , we will make this province a home for all@@ .
In conclu@@ sion@@ , Premier and hon@@ our@@ able gu@@ es@@ ts, the sm@@ oo@@ th process of the administration of the exam@@ s and exc@@ ell@@ ent resul@@ ts, is a reflec@@ tion of the de@@ dic@@ ation, commit@@ ment and profes@@ sion@@ alis@@ m of the offici@@ als of our department under the lea@@ ders@@ hip of the Su@@ per@@ inten@@ d@@ ent@@ -@@ General R@@ on Swart@@ z@@ , De@@ pu@@ ty@@ -@@ Director General B@@ ra@@ in Sch@@ re@@ u@@ der, Chief Director P@@ enn@@ y V@@ in@@ je@@ vol@@ d, Director of C@@ ur@@ riculum Development J@@ enn@@ y R@@ a@@ ult@@ -@@ S@@ mi@@ th, Director of Ex@@ amin@@ ations An@@ dr@@ Ã@@  Cla@@ us@@ en, and many other director@@ s and staff of our Education Management and Development C@@ entr@@ es.
I want to th@@ ank them for their ef@@ for@@ ts and h@@ ard work.
B@@ ut most import@@ ant@@ ly, I want to th@@ ank the 28@@ ,@@ 500 teach@@ ers and 8@@ ,@@ 000 public serv@@ ants on whom we dep@@ end to deli@@ ver education to our lear@@ ners@@ .
We have done well@@ .
We have impro@@ ved quali@@ ty.
O@@ ur histor@@ ically disadvantaged schools are do@@ ing it.
B@@ ut there is work to be don@@ e.

C@@ hoo@@ sing the P@@ ath of Un@@ ity for the World Cla@@ ss Province
In@@ tro@@ duction
We have gre@@ at c@@ ause for c@@ ele@@ br@@ ation.
There has ne@@ ver been a better mo@@ ment to be a South Afric@@ an, and there is no better place to live in South Africa than right here in the Western Cape.
Con@@ si@@ der for a mo@@ ment how f@@ ar we have com@@ e, and how f@@ ast we have mo@@ v@@ ed.
T@@ en years is bar@@ ely suff@@ icient time for the mat@@ ur@@ ation of a gre@@ at win@@ e; it is less time than it takes to educ@@ ate a child@@ ; it repres@@ ents one 80@@ th of the age of the gi@@ ant Out@@ eni@@ qu@@ a Y@@ el@@ lo@@ ww@@ ood that to@@ w@@ ers above the T@@ si@@ t@@ si@@ kam@@ ma For@@ est@@ .
Y@@ et we have ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ hed more to bring human di@@ gn@@ ity to milli@@ ons in the first ten years of South African demo@@ cracy than was ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ hed in the ten dec@@ ades that prec@@ e@@ ded them@@ .
We have se@@ en communities re@@ jo@@ in@@ ed, h@@ ope res@@ tor@@ ed and the cre@@ ation of a new streng@@ th groun@@ ded in our determin@@ ation to build our fu@@ ture toge@@ th@@ er.
The power of the Western Cape lies in the charac@@ ter and di@@ spo@@ si@@ tion of its peop@@ le.
Th@@ rough har@@ ds@@ hip and succ@@ ess in our histor@@ y our people have been form@@ ed with st@@ amin@@ a, a determin@@ ation to sur@@ vi@@ ve and to li@@ v@@ e, de@@ ep@@ ly and lo@@ ay@@ ally ro@@ o@@ ted in our province and our countr@@ y.
For c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies there were di@@ am@@ onds that la@@ y bur@@ i@@ ed under the shi@@ f@@ ting d@@ un@@ es at Klein@@ see and A@@ le@@ x@@ ander Bay, h@@ id@@ den for gener@@ ations from those who had no ide@@ a of the we@@ alth bene@@ ath their fe@@ et.
Li@@ ke those di@@ am@@ ond@@ s, the h@@ id@@ den potential of our people la@@ y un@@ t@@ app@@ ed for dec@@ ad@@ es.
There were f@@ la@@ sh@@ es of h@@ op@@ e, and those who occ@@ asion@@ ally ro@@ se above their res@@ tric@@ ted opportunities to sh@@ in@@ e.
It has only been in the last ten years of re@@ al fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , ho@@ wever, and in the last two years when our co@@ ali@@ tion has govern@@ ed for all the communities of the Western Cape, that the potential of our people has been tr@@ uly un@@ ear@@ th@@ ed.
In our commit@@ ment to build a Wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ cla@@ ss Provin@@ ce, we are b@@ us@@ y dis@@ cover@@ ing and un@@ loc@@ king the bri@@ lli@@ ance of rough@@ -@@ di@@ am@@ onds in communities and areas like Khayelitsha, Mitch@@ el@@ ls Plain and the Kar@@ oo@@ .
For the first time the t@@ al@@ ents of all our people are being har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in this building proc@@ ess, and this is a tre@@ as@@ ure that we must gu@@ ard with gre@@ at car@@ e.
Spe@@ ak@@ er, the people of the Karoo and N@@ am@@ a@@ qu@@ al@@ and under@@ stand the effec@@ ts of d@@ rough@@ t.
They know to@@ o that j@@ ust below the sur@@ fac@@ e of the E@@ ar@@ th lie the se@@ eds in which res@@ ts the s@@ le@@ eping potential of their reg@@ ion.
Wit@@ h the first ra@@ in@@ s, even after years of d@@ rough@@ t, these se@@ eds ger@@ min@@ ate and this world that was dr@@ y and ber@@ ef@@ t of life becomes a g@@ ar@@ den of v@@ it@@ ality which sustain@@ s and sup@@ ports its peop@@ le.
And this is the way the people of the Western Cape ar@@ e.
O@@ ur peop@@ le@@ 's charac@@ ter and di@@ spo@@ si@@ tion en@@ abled them to sur@@ vi@@ ve tr@@ ying times and har@@ ds@@ hi@@ p@@ s.
And with the com@@ ing of the first ra@@ in, that potential of our people and our province op@@ ened up into s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing that gro@@ ws vig@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, in which everyone can sh@@ are, and that can only re@@ ach new h@@ eigh@@ ts.
B@@ ut it is only the begin@@ ning of blo@@ ss@@ om@@ ing, and now that the ra@@ in has star@@ ted to f@@ all we should ensure that no@@ thing will spo@@ il the c@@ ro@@ p.
People of the Karoo know that in that reg@@ ion you find the eigh@@ t-@@ day gr@@ ass@@ .
The mo@@ ment it ra@@ in@@ s, you can b@@ et on it that within eight days the eigh@@ t-@@ day gr@@ as@@ s will f@@ l@@ ouris@@ h@@ .
S@@ he@@ ep are once ag@@ ain h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul and r@@ un after the new gre@@ en gr@@ ass@@ .
B@@ ut the people of the Karoo also know that this repres@@ ents a f@@ al@@ se h@@ op@@ e, for alth@@ ough the eigh@@ t-@@ day gr@@ as@@ s may l@@ ook fine and gre@@ en, its nu@@ tri@@ tional value is very low and it cannot la@@ st@@ .
In the K@@ al@@ a@@ har@@ i one also fin@@ ds the N@@ '@@ ab@@ b@@ as@@ .
This is a N@@ ama word for a m@@ us@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ -@@ like de@@ lic@@ ac@@ y.
It remain@@ s under the groun@@ d wa@@ it@@ ing for the right circum@@ stan@@ ces to gro@@ w and to be har@@ v@@ es@@ ted.
O@@ ther@@ wise it dis@@ app@@ ear@@ s ag@@ ain for years.
If the N@@ '@@ ab@@ b@@ as does not get ra@@ in in Mar@@ ch, its v@@ it@@ ality will ne@@ ver bre@@ ak through the sur@@ fac@@ e.
And if it is not p@@ ick@@ ed early in w@@ inter@@ , it will be ni@@ p@@ p@@ ed by fro@@ st@@ .
In the Karoo and in N@@ am@@ a@@ qu@@ al@@ and there is also the g@@ ann@@ abo@@ s.
This b@@ us@@ h is t@@ ough as lea@@ ther and has a high nu@@ tri@@ tional valu@@ e.
The g@@ ann@@ abo@@ s can also be com@@ par@@ ed with the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the G@@ ri@@ qu@@ a peop@@ le, the kan@@ ni@@ ed@@ ood - a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the G@@ ri@@ qu@@ a peop@@ le@@ 's ability to ke@@ ep on gro@@ wing and to become str@@ on@@ ger in sp@@ i@@ te of har@@ ds@@ hi@@ p.
D@@ uring the d@@ rou@@ ght the plant se@@ em@@ s to be dr@@ y and lif@@ el@@ ess, but as soon as the ra@@ in star@@ ts to f@@ all, it se@@ em@@ s to come to life again@@ .
In times of har@@ ds@@ hip it lo@@ ses its blo@@ om@@ , but its ro@@ o@@ ts are an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed so fir@@ m@@ ly in the ear@@ th that in the right conditions it may re@@ appe@@ ar year after year.
In the Western Cape we are in@@ de@@ ed sho@@ wing our charac@@ ter j@@ ust as the g@@ ann@@ abo@@ s and the kan@@ ni@@ ed@@ ood do@@ .
No@@ w that the ra@@ in has star@@ ted to f@@ all and the conditions are righ@@ t, the road we have ch@@ os@@ en is not one that will bring our people j@@ ust eigh@@ t-@@ day gr@@ as@@ s - in other word@@ s only temporary re@@ li@@ ef and f@@ al@@ se h@@ op@@ e.
Economic growth without job cre@@ ation and sustain@@ ability is not good en@@ ough for our peop@@ le.
By intro@@ duc@@ ing the right plan@@ s at the right time and implementing them with dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ e, we will tre@@ at our people to N@@ '@@ ab@@ b@@ as - the best de@@ lic@@ acy there is.
O@@ ur plan@@ s are aimed the establish@@ ment of st@@ ability and sustain@@ ability - di@@ gn@@ ity for all our people - an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed with vig@@ or@@ ous ro@@ o@@ ts as those of the g@@ ann@@ abo@@ s and kan@@ ni@@ ed@@ oo@@ d.
Spe@@ ak@@ er, our Government repres@@ ents all the people of the Western Cape.
No longer are we divi@@ de@@ d.
To@@ day we have a Government in the Western Cape that govern@@ s for all the people of this province.
We are ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ating that col@@ ou@@ re@@ d, wh@@ ite@@ , black and In@@ di@@ an South Afric@@ ans succ@@ eed best when working in part@@ nership to build our shar@@ ed fu@@ ture.
A charge to ke@@ ep
I was gre@@ at@@ ly mo@@ ved this mor@@ ning to be g@@ ree@@ ted by so many children of the Western Cape - from every community - their vo@@ ic@@ es uni@@ ted in son@@ g, their fac@@ es uni@@ ted in h@@ op@@ e, and their fu@@ tures uni@@ ted in and by South Africa.
T@@ en years ol@@ d, they are our fre@@ e-@@ bor@@ n gener@@ ation - the most con@@ cre@@ te and power@@ ful ex@@ pres@@ sion of how f@@ ar we have come in the first dec@@ ade of South African demo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y.
L@@ ast February I commit@@ ted our Government to making 2003 a year of implementation and deliver@@ y, to la@@ ying the groun@@ d@@ -@@ work for addres@@ sing both our sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term chall@@ eng@@ es and their l@@ ong@@ -@@ term ca@@ us@@ es.
We intro@@ duced iKapa eli@@ H@@ lumay@@ o to promote growth in the Cape so that everyone may share in it - the best vehicle to dri@@ ve our policies and our ac@@ tions for the next dec@@ ade@@ . iKapa eli@@ H@@ lumay@@ o is our vehicle to car@@ ry every community with us on the p@@ ath to being a wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ cla@@ ss province.
This is our charge to ke@@ ep@@ .
D@@ uring the p@@ ast two years our Co@@ ali@@ tion of H@@ ope has established a st@@ able plat@@ form in the Western Cape.
This Co@@ ali@@ tion is an an@@ ch@@ or cre@@ ating security for foreign and local inves@@ tors - inves@@ tors who@@ se part@@ nership we de@@ ep@@ ly app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate in the growth and development of our econ@@ omy so that we may create j@@ ob@@ s for our peop@@ le.
L@@ ong@@ -@@ term planning h@@ ori@@ z@@ on
A@@ part from st@@ ability and bre@@ ak@@ ing down the bar@@ ri@@ ers between our commun@@ iti@@ es, the gre@@ at@@ est contribu@@ tion of this Government to the fu@@ ture succ@@ ess of our province has been the intro@@ duction of a l@@ ong@@ -@@ term planning h@@ ori@@ z@@ on - pu@@ tting into place 10 and 15 year plan@@ s to address the under@@ ly@@ ing ca@@ uses of many of our most serious chall@@ en@@ ges@@ .
It is f@@ it@@ ting that we are able to re@@ port, in the last two years of the first dec@@ ade of demo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y, that we have exc@@ el@@ led in the cre@@ ation of so@@ lid f@@ ound@@ ations for exp@@ and@@ ing our service delivery and building la@@ sting human di@@ gn@@ ity in the next dec@@ ade@@ .
U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ment, migr@@ ation and job cre@@ ation
En@@ s@@ uring the fu@@ ture for our gener@@ ations to fol@@ low requi@@ res us to ser@@ i@@ ously and ur@@ gen@@ tly address the issues of un@@ employment and p@@ over@@ ty.
O@@ ur provincial pop@@ ulation has gro@@ wn from j@@ ust less than 4 million in 1996 to well over 4@@ ,@@ 5 million according to C@@ ens@@ us 2001 - main@@ ly as a result of migr@@ ation from other provin@@ ces.
This means that our provincial pop@@ ulation has been gro@@ wing by about 2,@@ 9@@ % an@@ nu@@ al@@ ly, com@@ par@@ ed to national pop@@ ulation growth of about 2,@@ 1@@ %@@ .
M@@ ore sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly th@@ ou@@ gh@@ , the econom@@ ically ac@@ tive pop@@ ulation in our province gre@@ w al@@ most tw@@ ice as f@@ ast as it di@@ d in South Africa as a who@@ le.
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st the most important issues addres@@ sed at our rec@@ ent Cabinet Bos@@ ber@@ aad was the need to agre@@ e, with our social part@@ n@@ ers, on micro@@ -@@ economic strateg@@ ies for the province to meet our tar@@ ge@@ ts.
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five years we will ensure R@@ 5 b@@ illi@@ on@@ 's new inv@@ est@@ ments and at least 100 000 new job opportun@@ ities.
We also inten@@ d to create 120 000 sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term job and training opportunities by means of exten@@ sive public works programmes by 200@@ 8.
A deliver@@ y-@@ foc@@ used M@@ TE@@ F bud@@ get with fis@@ cal dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ ak@@ er, Minister R@@ as@@ ool and his Departments have pres@@ ented us with a foc@@ used and pri@@ or@@ it@@ y-@@ d@@ riv@@ en bud@@ get that conc@@ entr@@ ates our sp@@ ending on the implementation of iKapa eli@@ H@@ lumay@@ o@@ .
O@@ urs is a bud@@ get em@@ ph@@ asi@@ sing both tar@@ ge@@ ted p@@ over@@ ty re@@ li@@ ef and the development that the Western Cape needs for sustain@@ ed economic growth and job cre@@ ation.
O@@ ur bud@@ get em@@ br@@ ac@@ es re@@ al fis@@ cal dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ e.
We will not mor@@ t@@ g@@ age the fu@@ ture of our fre@@ e-@@ bor@@ n gener@@ ation for sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term g@@ ain@@ s.
In addres@@ sing the bac@@ k@@ log@@ s of our pa@@ st@@ , this Govern@@ ment, in our Medi@@ um@@ -@@ term Bud@@ get Policy State@@ ment, has re@@ duced the bud@@ ge@@ ted def@@ ici@@ t from more than R@@ 4@@ 34 million in 200@@ 3@@ /0@@ 4 to R@@ 36@@ 6 million in 2004@@ /@@ 5.
Health@@ care 2010
Un@@ der the lea@@ ders@@ hip of our Provincial Minister of Health@@ , Pi@@ et Me@@ y@@ er, Health@@ care 2010 was approved by the Provincial Cabinet in March last year.
Health@@ care 2010 is designed to ensure that in@@ stead of a R1 b@@ illi@@ on health def@@ ici@@ t by 201@@ 0, the people of the Western Cape will see impro@@ ved services.
The end result is projec@@ ted to be an increase in our capacity by an additional 2 million primary health visi@@ ts every year by 201@@ 0@@ .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st the many other succ@@ esses in health care over the p@@ ast year has been the in-@@ prin@@ cip@@ le appro@@ val of up to US@@ $@@ 66 million over five years from the G@@ lo@@ b@@ al Fund to fi@@ ght HIV/@@ A@@ id@@ s@@ ; and the ro@@ ll@@ -@@ out of our Prevention of Mo@@ ther@@ -@@ to-@@ child Trans@@ mission of Aids Programme to 100@@ % of pregn@@ ant women atten@@ ding public health clinic@@ s.
Bud@@ get pres@@ su@@ res on the Social Safety N@@ et, Health@@ , and housing delivery
It is import@@ an@@ t, M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ ak@@ er, for us to under@@ stand both the s@@ cop@@ e of the chall@@ eng@@ es and the bud@@ get pres@@ su@@ res fac@@ ing Ministers Me@@ y@@ er and Fran@@ s@@ man@@ , and their Depart@@ men@@ ts, part@@ ly as a result of migr@@ ation, part@@ ly because of the res@@ tr@@ uc@@ t@@ uring of health car@@ e, and part@@ ly because of the exp@@ an@@ ded need for social gran@@ ts.
The number of social grant benef@@ ici@@ aries has increas@@ ed from about 36@@ 2 000 in December 2001 to more than 50@@ 2 000 this month - and it is projec@@ ted that the number will re@@ ach 5@@ 50 000 by next year.
The single lar@@ ges@@ t d@@ riv@@ er of this growth is the increase in child support gr@@ ants - this month we already have 42 4@@ 79 children between the ages of 8 and 9 recei@@ ving these gran@@ ts.
We be@@ li@@ eve that by the end of the next financial year@@ , more than 93 000 children over the age of 7 will be benefit@@ ing from these gran@@ ts.
Si@@ mi@@ lar chall@@ eng@@ es are experi@@ enc@@ ed in our ren@@ dering of health services - wh@@ er@@ e@@ as migr@@ ation to the province al@@ one nec@@ es@@ si@@ t@@ ates the building of up to three new clinics every year.
A@@ part from th@@ is, and the f@@ act that an anal@@ ysi@@ s by the National Department of Health indic@@ ated that increas@@ ed fin@@ anc@@ ing - am@@ oun@@ ting to about R@@ 150 million per year - for the Western Cape is j@@ usti@@ fi@@ ed, the ever de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing condi@@ tional alloc@@ ation for tertiary health services will most pro@@ bab@@ ly result in a def@@ ici@@ t of about R@@ 16@@ 0 million in re@@ al term@@ s.
Minister H@@ ang@@ ana and her Department of Housing are fac@@ ing com@@ par@@ able chall@@ en@@ ges@@ .
In sp@@ i@@ te of our having al@@ most d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the Housing Bud@@ get from R@@ 2@@ 71 million in 2001 to R@@ 5@@ 14 million last year@@ , we are unable to ke@@ ep up with the de@@ mand@@ .
We must address the under@@ -@@ sp@@ ending of our Housing Bud@@ ge@@ t.
This is a countr@@ y-@@ wi@@ de proble@@ m because of new national legislation and regul@@ ations, as well as a lack of capacity at local government level@@ , but we must also rec@@ ti@@ fy the situ@@ ation in the Department of Housing so that ever@@ y@@ body p@@ ul@@ ls in the same direc@@ tion.
Ag@@ ain@@ st the bac@@ k@@ groun@@ d of these pres@@ sing bud@@ get issu@@ es, the Western Cape Government will be eng@@ aging con@@ struc@@ ti@@ vely this year with the National Government on the com@@ position of the eq@@ uitable share form@@ ula@@ , and the extent of condi@@ tional gr@@ ants ar@@ ising out of national polic@@ y.
The new Draft Strateg@@ y for Human Resources and Skills Development
Spe@@ ak@@ er, we under@@ stand that quality education is the key to job cre@@ ation.
The resul@@ ting report and recommend@@ ations, com@@ bin@@ ed with Minister G@@ a@@ um and his Depart@@ ment's Visi@@ on 2@@ 02@@ 0, will help us to bre@@ ak down the so@@ -@@ called '@@ si@@ lo@@ s of learn@@ ing@@ '@@ , em@@ ph@@ asi@@ sing an integrated appro@@ ach to all provincial education from pre@@ -@@ G@@ rade R@@ , through form@@ al schoo@@ ling and tertiary educ@@ ation, to work@@ -@@ place learn@@ ing, Adult Basic Education and Tra@@ in@@ ing, and lif@@ e-@@ long learn@@ ing.
L@@ ast year@@ 's increase in the ma@@ tric pas@@ s rate for the third year in a ro@@ w@@ , to a record of 87@@ ,@@ 1@@ %@@ , indic@@ ates that our education and training initi@@ atives continue to be@@ ar fr@@ uit@@ .
BE@@ E Con@@ fer@@ ence and Provincial Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit
The Western Cape bro@@ ke new groun@@ d in May last year when we were the first province to ho@@ st a con@@ fer@@ ence on black economic em@@ powerment to set the t@@ one for the implementation of iKapa eli@@ H@@ lumay@@ o@@ .
In the Western Cape black economic em@@ powerment should also include bro@@ wn economic em@@ power@@ ment.
The Black Economic Empowerment Con@@ fer@@ ence also ga@@ ve re@@ al imp@@ et@@ us to the fir@@ st@@ -@@ ever Provincial Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit which we ho@@ sted in November with our social part@@ ners@@ .
By br@@ ing@@ ing together Govern@@ ment, business (@@ including agric@@ ulture@@ ), labour and the community (@@ including wo@@ men@@ , the youth and the dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d@@ ) we achiev@@ ed not only a framework agreement as the basis of a new social accor@@ d for the provin@@ ce, but also re@@ ached cons@@ ens@@ us on the m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ economic strateg@@ ies for the province.
Strategic Infrastructure Plan
Government re@@ alis@@ es that our growth strategy must be bac@@ ked by the necessary physical infrastr@@ uc@@ ture.
Th@@ at is wh@@ y Minister E@@ s@@ so@@ p and her Department are b@@ us@@ y with the last fin@@ is@@ hing t@@ ou@@ ches to our Strategic Infrastructure Plan to streng@@ then our growth sec@@ tors and to direct our exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture in the first place towards the most cri@@ tical infrastr@@ uc@@ ture.
This will@@ , by means of con@@ struction work@@ , also provide job opportunities in the sh@@ ort term and the transfer of knowledge in our po@@ or@@ est commun@@ ities.
O@@ ur key aim is to increase the levels of inves@@ tment in key social and economic infrastructure from the current 1,@@ 1@@ % of G@@ D@@ P@@ R to 2,@@ 5@@ % by 200@@ 8.
To address the esti@@ m@@ ated R1,@@ 4 b@@ illi@@ on bac@@ k@@ lo@@ g in provincial road infrastructure and main@@ ten@@ ance, we will also be pur@@ su@@ ing with the National Treasur@@ y the implementation of a fu@@ el lev@@ y in the Western Cape.
The fe@@ asi@@ bility report has been completed and the Province will emb@@ ar@@ k on a process to cons@@ ult with industry and the tax@@ pay@@ ers through a public he@@ aring process pri@@ or to any fin@@ al represent@@ ations being made to the National Treasur@@ y.
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing police numbers by 50@@ %
M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ ak@@ er, at this very mo@@ ment we are increas@@ ing the number of police officers from 12 000 to 18 000 in the Western Cape.
When our co@@ ali@@ tion government took office in late 200@@ 1, there were 11 8@@ 33 police officers in our province.
L@@ ast year we ann@@ oun@@ ced that 3 2@@ 12 new police rec@@ r@@ uit@@ s (@@ 6@@ 4@@ % of the national in@@ tak@@ e) would be ad@@ ded to the SAP@@ S in our province.
There are currently more than 16 000 officers protec@@ ting our communities and we are well on trac@@ k to boo@@ st this number to 18 000 by the end of this year - a more than 50@@ % increase in j@@ ust two years.
N@@ ex@@ t month al@@ one will see a further 1 7@@ 00 new rec@@ r@@ uit@@ s in the provin@@ ce, with another 900 due in Ma@@ y.
We have done this to bre@@ ak the g@@ rip that crimin@@ als have on some of our n@@ eighbour@@ hoo@@ d@@ s, and to sec@@ ure the stre@@ ets for our gener@@ ations bor@@ n in fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .
Th@@ at is wh@@ y we have had the saf@@ est fes@@ tive se@@ as@@ on in a dec@@ ade@@ .
I would like to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ula@@ te Minister R@@ am@@ at@@ la@@ kan@@ e, Provincial Police C@@ ommissioner P@@ etro@@ s, the m@@ en and women of the SAP@@ S, our EM@@ S and traffic st@@ aff@@ , and every volun@@ teer who@@ se h@@ ard work led to this out@@ standing achiev@@ e@@ ment.
M@@ ur@@ der dro@@ p@@ p@@ ed by 34@@ %@@ , ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y was down 24@@ % and total crime f@@ ell by 18@@ ,@@ 2@@ %@@ .
Wit@@ h other polic@@ ing initi@@ atives like the ro@@ ll@@ -@@ out of 36 new C@@ C@@ T@@ V c@@ am@@ er@@ as at a cost of R@@ 11 million to new areas like Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, the streng@@ th@@ ening of our Child Protection Un@@ its around the provin@@ ce, and our plan@@ s to tra@@ in n@@ eighbourhood street committees this year@@ , we are tur@@ ning the ti@@ de against cri@@ me.
O@@ ff@@ ici@@ ally bre@@ ak@@ ing the bar@@ ri@@ er of 1 million over@@ se@@ as touris@@ ts
For the first time in histor@@ y more than 1 million foreign touris@@ ts travel@@ led to our province last year@@ , there@@ by boo@@ sting our local econ@@ omy directly by about R@@ 17 b@@ illi@@ on.
This is at@@ tribu@@ table to Minister Wit@@ b@@ ooi and her Depart@@ ment, who@@ se ef@@ for@@ ts to ensure l@@ ong@@ -@@ term tourism growth are already be@@ aring fr@@ uit@@ .
Wit@@ h mil@@ est@@ on@@ es like the op@@ ening of the Cape Town International Con@@ vention Centre, the success@@ ful st@@ aging of the C@@ ric@@ k@@ et World C@@ up Op@@ ening Cer@@ em@@ on@@ y and the g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing Presid@@ ent@@ 's C@@ up@@ , increas@@ ed numbers of direct f@@ ligh@@ ts to Cape Town, and our plan@@ s to laun@@ ch our Western Cape Tourist Guide Registration Sy@@ stem in the next two week@@ s, tourism in the province is on the mo@@ v@@ e.
We also plan to pas@@ s the new Western Cape Tourism Act this year and to laun@@ ch our new D@@ est@@ in@@ ation Marketing Organis@@ ation (@@ D@@ MO@@ ).
It is c@@ le@@ ar that touris@@ m, as one of our most important growth sec@@ tor@@ s, is po@@ ised to re@@ ach even greater h@@ eigh@@ ts in 2004 with projec@@ ted growth of about 6@@ %@@ .
We remain commit@@ ted to our tar@@ get of at@@ trac@@ ting 3 million touris@@ ts a year by 201@@ 0@@ .
F@@ ast@@ -@@ trac@@ ked and sustainable land re@@ form
S@@ in@@ ce August 2001 there have been more than 4 400 benef@@ ici@@ aries of agricultural land re@@ form in the Western Cape and we are planning to have this number increas@@ ed to 7 000 in the next few years.
Minister Gel@@ der@@ bl@@ om and his Depart@@ ment, in part@@ nership with the National Govern@@ ment, have also succ@@ ee@@ ded in ens@@ uring that 5@@ 4@@ % of these benef@@ ici@@ aries are women and 40@@ % young peop@@ le, making land re@@ form one of the most important t@@ ools of direct em@@ powerment in our province.
To ensure their l@@ ong@@ -@@ term succ@@ ess, we have also op@@ ened a new agricultural training centre at Geor@@ ge.
This will be follow@@ ed by the op@@ ening of a si@@ mi@@ lar centre at Oudtshoorn early this year@@ , and a third at Vredendal next year.
R@@ en@@ ew@@ ed ur@@ ban and rural development focus
Spe@@ ak@@ er, g@@ ui@@ ded by Minister Do@@ w@@ ry@@ , the Provincial Cabinet has now approved the business plan@@ s for the on@@ going development of Mitch@@ el@@ ls Plain and Khayelitsha through the U@@ r@@ ban R@@ en@@ ew@@ al Program@@ me.
In part@@ nership with the City of Cape Town we will be developing c@@ entral business distr@@ ic@@ ts in these two development no@@ des to a value of more than R@@ 5@@ 80 million over five years.
We will also be renew@@ ing our focus on rural development in areas like the Central Kar@@ oo@@ , to ensure that our provincial growth benefits all Western Cape commun@@ iti@@ es, and not only those in ur@@ ban areas.
In the p@@ ast year we have also made much progres@@ s in streng@@ th@@ ening the coo@@ per@@ ation and coordin@@ ation between our Provincial Government and the municipalities of the Western Cape.
O@@ ur ef@@ for@@ ts to bring development and increas@@ ed opportun@@ ity to our areas in gre@@ at@@ est need have also been a focus for Minister Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie and his Depart@@ ment.
Th@@ rough maj@@ or events like the C@@ ric@@ k@@ et World C@@ up and also through gr@@ ass@@ -@@ ro@@ o@@ ts initi@@ atives like the Sports Ste@@ p@@ ping St@@ on@@ es Pro@@ jec@@ t, we continue to bring all communities on@@ to the p@@ ath to wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ cla@@ ss quali@@ ty.
Con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion
In conclu@@ sion@@ , M@@ ad@@ ame Spe@@ ak@@ er, many of us living in the Western Cape f@@ all into the tra@@ p of for@@ ge@@ tting how good life is in our province.
We for@@ get that the inf@@ low of people from all parts of South Afric@@ a, and from around the wor@@ l@@ d, is testi@@ mon@@ y to our on@@ going succ@@ ess.
We for@@ get that we have every right to be pro@@ u@@ d of the Western Cape and that we should be pro@@ u@@ d to live and work her@@ e.
Th@@ at sa@@ id@@ , we must al@@ ways re@@ member that much work still needs to be done to ra@@ ise the standard of living for th@@ ous@@ and@@ s in our po@@ or@@ est commun@@ ities.
I would like to take this opportun@@ ity to ex@@ pres@@ s my personal app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation to the le@@ ader of our co@@ ali@@ tion part@@ ner in Govern@@ ment, Minister R@@ as@@ ool@@ .
No@@ where has it been more ap@@ parent how positive this co@@ ali@@ tion is for the Western Cape than during our Provincial Im@@ bi@@ z@@ o F@@ o@@ c@@ us We@@ ek and the Pres@@ identi@@ al Im@@ bi@@ z@@ o last year@@ , where the people of the province in v@@ ast numbers end@@ or@@ sed our Government and ex@@ pres@@ sed their app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for our will@@ ing@@ ness to work together in the interests of their commun@@ ities.
I also take pri@@ de in the public service in our province under the lea@@ der@@ hip of our Director@@ -@@ Gener@@ al, Dr G@@ il@@ ber@@ t La@@ w@@ r@@ ence, and the He@@ ads of Depart@@ ments.
The people of the Western Cape can be pro@@ u@@ d to have the about 6@@ 8 000 ex@@ tre@@ mel@@ y compet@@ ent m@@ en and women in our public servic@@ e, and on behalf of the Government and the people of the province I wish to th@@ ank them@@ .
T@@ on@@ igh@@ t at a g@@ al@@ a din@@ ner in Paarl we will hon@@ our our public serv@@ ants for their exc@@ ell@@ ent service during the first ten years of demo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y.
In re@@ memb@@ ering our first dec@@ ade of demo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y, and in c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating our first fre@@ e-@@ bor@@ n gener@@ ation, we should also re@@ member that the chall@@ eng@@ es we must still fac@@ e will be over@@ come through the same str@@ ong part@@ nershi@@ ps that have b@@ rou@@ ght us this f@@ ar@@ .
When bla@@ c@@ k, wh@@ i@@ te and col@@ ou@@ red people take hand@@ s and put their he@@ ads toge@@ th@@ er, we succ@@ eed best in impro@@ ving the li@@ ves of all@@ .
L@@ et us jo@@ in hand@@ s to build our wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ cla@@ ss province.
To@@ ge@@ ther we are sec@@ uring a fair share for our s@@ ons and da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters in the Western Cape.

"@@ This R 2.@@ 13 b@@ illi@@ on is a maj@@ or inst@@ all@@ ment on the R 5 b@@ illi@@ on that we under@@ took to bring to our Province at the Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit last year.
As a Government we are commit@@ ted to do@@ ing our part as we build the Home for Al@@ l.
"@@ It is good to see c@@ ran@@ es lin@@ ing the c@@ ity h@@ ori@@ z@@ on as a sure sign of progres@@ s and conf@@ id@@ ence.
The con@@ struction industry is back in business to build on the skills of the Province and to provide much nee@@ ded work.
"@@ It is most encour@@ aging for the long term that this new wa@@ ve of development in the c@@ ity is character@@ ised by four important fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es: mix@@ ed use princi@@ pl@@ es, ra@@ cial and social integr@@ ation, black economic em@@ powerment and ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ tural in@@ nov@@ ation.
"@@ We wel@@ come the commit@@ ment to mix@@ ed@@ -@@ use development by CO@@ ES@@ SA and E@@ u@@ ro@@ -@@ Cape am@@ ong@@ st oth@@ ers.
The deli@@ ber@@ ate inclu@@ sion of comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al, ret@@ ail and res@@ identi@@ al facilities in development initi@@ atives reflec@@ ts the best of current international planning mo@@ del@@ s.

The ra@@ cial and cla@@ ss integr@@ ation of our physical sp@@ ac@@ es is ess@@ enti@@ al to sec@@ ure and exp@@ and the Home for Al@@ l.
The f@@ act that the histor@@ ic c@@ ity centre is pla@@ ying a le@@ ading role in br@@ ing@@ ing our people together in@@ stead of serv@@ ing mer@@ ely as a centre of established we@@ alth is very encour@@ ag@@ ing.
"@@ The development of the I@@ c@@ on by 100@@ % black own@@ ed CO@@ ES@@ SA will be a sign@@ post to black economic em@@ power@@ ment.
This state of the ar@@ t 20 stor@@ ey development on land rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed from the se@@ a in 19@@ 37 is one of the first of its size being under@@ taken by a black compan@@ y.

E@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts of str@@ on@@ ger R@@ and on Agriculture
22 July 2004
The ex@@ change rate app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation has positive imp@@ lic@@ ations for some indus@@ tri@@ es, while neg@@ ati@@ vely affec@@ ting oth@@ ers.
The state of agricultural mark@@ ets affec@@ ts ever@@ y@@ thing from the income of f@@ arm@@ ers to the trade bal@@ anc@@ e.
Wel@@ l over hal@@ f of the countr@@ y's agricultural ex@@ ports origin@@ ate from the Western Cape and with 60@@ % of the Western Cape agricultural produce inten@@ ded for export mark@@ et@@ s, the flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation caused by the R@@ and@@ 's position against the maj@@ or cur@@ ren@@ cies will in the l@@ ong@@ -@@ term impact on the Western Cape econom@@ y.
Agriculture is the only industr@@ y, which has g@@ ain@@ ed and cre@@ ated j@@ ob@@ s.
St@@ atisti@@ cs have also sho@@ wn that the a@@ ver@@ age num@@ er@@ ation of farm workers in the Western Cape is 25@@ % higher than the a@@ ver@@ age for South Africa.
A str@@ on@@ ger R@@ and has the pos@@ sibi@@ lity to change all th@@ is.
In the l@@ ong@@ -@@ term a str@@ on@@ ger R@@ and c@@ ou@@ ple@@ d with the current dra@@ u@@ ght situ@@ ation will nec@@ es@@ si@@ t@@ ate structural changes in order to achi@@ eve the objec@@ tives of iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o - the gro@@ wing Cape.
Research by the Department of Agriculture@@ 's econom@@ is@@ ts at Elsenburg has sho@@ wn that free mon@@ et@@ ary and com@@ modi@@ ty mark@@ ets still hol@@ ds the most advan@@ t@@ ages for the econom@@ y, but there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need for effective strategi@@ c plann@@ ing, financial risk management systems and the requi@@ site cont@@ ing@@ ency plann@@ ing.
This research has also poin@@ ted out that parties that have a direct interest in the ex@@ change rate of the South African curr@@ ency should re-@@ organ@@ iz@@ e their businesses in order to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date the vol@@ ati@@ le nature of world mark@@ ets and the ex@@ change r@@ ate.
We will together with other ro@@ le@@ -@@ pla@@ y@@ ers monitor the situ@@ ation very clo@@ sel@@ y and the flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation caused by the R@@ and@@ 's position against the maj@@ or cur@@ ren@@ cies will be a poin@@ t of disc@@ us@@ sion at the Western Cape Agricultural S@@ um@@ mit sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led for later this year.

Laingsburg - Provincial Government Is Comm@@ it@@ ted To The Fin@@ alisation Of Pro@@ c@@ ess - U@@ p@@ gr@@ ade Of C@@ em@@ eter@@ y
25 March 2004
SO@@ UR@@ C@@ E: Ministry of Local Government and Housing (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
L@@ ast year the provincial government of the Western Cape was involved in a process of thor@@ ough investig@@ ations to ref@@ ute al@@ leg@@ ations over the exis@@ ten@@ ce of an alle@@ ged mass gr@@ ave in Laingsburg after the 198@@ 1 f@@ l@@ ood@@ s.
Al@@ th@@ ough the further hand@@ ling of this very s@@ ensi@@ tive issue is v@@ ested with the Laingsburg Municipality it is in the interest of the bro@@ ader Laingsburg community that the provincial government not only acts in a re@@ con@@ cili@@ atory man@@ n@@ er, but is also acti@@ vely eng@@ aged in the up@@ lif@@ tment of a town which was de@@ ep@@ ly divi@@ ded by these al@@ leg@@ ations.
At present the municipality is b@@ us@@ y with the development of a tourism centre and f@@ l@@ ood rou@@ te, as a touris@@ t at@@ trac@@ tion, for the town and to sti@@ m@@ ula@@ te the econ@@ omy of the reg@@ ion.
P@@ hase one will com@@ prise a tourism b@@ ure@@ au@@ /@@ museum@@ , con@@ fer@@ ence ro@@ om@@ s, ki@@ o@@ sk@@ s, et@@ c. Al@@ so inclu@@ ded is the con@@ struction of an o@@ be@@ lis@@ k as pro@@ posed by C@@ abin@@ et.
The funding for phase one is provided in total by the national Department of Environmental Affairs and Touris@@ m.
The municipality is currently a@@ wa@@ it@@ ing the rol@@ ling over of the fun@@ d@@ s.
To take the process of re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation and he@@ aling in the Laingsburg community for@@ ward the Provincial Government of the Western Cape has requ@@ ested the Municipal Council of Laingsburg to consi@@ der up@@ gr@@ ading the form@@ er col@@ ou@@ red c@@ em@@ eter@@ y where eight vic@@ ti@@ ms of the f@@ l@@ ood were bur@@ i@@ ed.
This will ensure that these gr@@ av@@ es receive the same rec@@ ogni@@ tion as the m@@ em@@ ori@@ al c@@ em@@ eter@@ y where most of the vic@@ ti@@ ms were bur@@ i@@ ed.
To@@ day the provincial government is pro@@ u@@ d to hand over an amount of R200 000 from the Con@@ soli@@ dated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (C@@ MI@@ P) to the Municipality of Laingsburg for the up@@ gr@@ ading of the G@@ Ã¶@@ l@@ d@@ ner@@ ville C@@ em@@ eter@@ y.
This amount is a contribu@@ tion to the total cost of R@@ 2@@ 50 000 which will include water supp@@ ly to the c@@ em@@ eter@@ y, the plan@@ ting of tre@@ es, a 200 m access ro@@ ad, an entr@@ ance w@@ all to the c@@ em@@ eter@@ y, st@@ ore facilities as well as ab@@ lution facili@@ ties.
In accordance with one of the go@@ als of C@@ MI@@ P local labour will be u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ed and it is esti@@ m@@ ated that 1 6@@ 20 person days of work will be provi@@ de@@ d, of which at least 30@@ % will consi@@ st of wo@@ men@@ .
It is a pri@@ vi@@ lege to be part of the process with the conclu@@ sion of this Laingsburg ch@@ ap@@ ter.
O@@ ur Government was determined from the start to achi@@ eve three th@@ ings for the Laingsburg commun@@ it@@ y: tr@@ u@@ th, re@@ con@@ cili@@ ation and clo@@ su@@ re@@ .
It is in the interest of the bro@@ ader Laingsburg community that all spher@@ es of government now work together to achi@@ eve clo@@ su@@ re@@ .
-@@ In addi@@ tion to this very important sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c ch@@ equ@@ e hand@@ over it is a ple@@ as@@ ure to ann@@ oun@@ ce that an amount R1,@@ 3 million has been approved for G@@ Ã¶@@ l@@ d@@ ner@@ ville and Berg@@ sig in Laingsburg for the rehabilitation of roads and related stor@@ m water@@ .
Wit@@ h high un@@ employment in this town it is esti@@ m@@ ated that this project will provide 3 5@@ 20 person days of work.

Minister Uys ann@@ oun@@ ced that the Department of Health made good progres@@ s to create a Directorate for N@@ urse Services and that the post will be adver@@ ti@@ sed so@@ on.
The Directorate will be responsible for advice to the department and the coordin@@ ation of n@@ urse related issu@@ es.
There will also be foc@@ used on the concer@@ ns de@@ aling with service provi@@ sion.
Minister Uys also mentioned other areas where they are working h@@ ard to improve the working environ@@ ments of n@@ urs@@ es:
* F@@ requ@@ ent me@@ et@@ ings with a represent@@ ative n@@ urs@@ es' man@@ aging committee where matters like over@@ time payment and r@@ are skills subsi@@ dies are being de@@ alt with@@ .

* The awar@@ ding of more bursaries for n@@ urse stud@@ en@@ ts.
This year 2,@@ 94@@ 8 bursaries were awar@@ de@@ d.

WH@@ O CAN C@@ LA@@ I@@ M WOR@@ K@@ ER@@ 'S COM@@ P@@ EN@@ SA@@ TION@@ ?
The Comp@@ ensation Fund covers workers who@@ :
* were h@@ ur@@ t in an accident while they were b@@ us@@ y with their work
* contrac@@ ted a disease through their work
* di@@ ed from a work@@ place accident or occ@@ upational diseas@@ e.
You can claim if you were in@@ j@@ ured or contrac@@ ted a disease while
* working (@@ permanent or cas@@ u@@ al@@ )
* com@@ pl@@ eting an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ces@@ hip
There are certain categories of worker who cannot claim from the fun@@ d.
For example, you cannot claim if you are:
* a domestic worker employed at a private home
* a member of the South African National De@@ f@@ ence For@@ ce (@@ there is a separ@@ ate fun@@ d@@ )
* a member of the South African Police Services (@@ there is a separ@@ ate fun@@ d@@ )
* a worker who do@@ es@@ n@@ 't work under the control of your employer
* a worker who works outside South Africa for more than 12 months at a time.
You can claim if you are:
* a domestic worker in a bo@@ ar@@ ding hou@@ se
* an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce or train@@ ee farm worker
* a worker paid by a labour ag@@ enc@@ y.
Cla@@ ims will only be paid if they are submitted in the correc@@ t way in the pro@@ per time.
Cla@@ ims will not be paid if@@ :
* The claim is made more than 12 months after the accident or de@@ ath@@ , or after the disease is diagno@@ s@@ ed.
* You are off work for 3 days or l@@ ess.
* The accident resul@@ ted from your own w@@ r@@ ong do@@ ing (@@ Un@@ less the worker is ser@@ i@@ ously dis@@ abled or dies in the accid@@ ent, then the Fund will still pay comp@@ ens@@ ation@@ ).
* You un@@ reason@@ ably ref@@ use to have medical treat@@ ment.
WH@@ O PA@@ Y@@ S IN@@ TO THE F@@ UN@@ D@@ ?
Employ@@ ers pay into the Comp@@ ensation Fund once a month@@ .
WHAT IN@@ J@@ UR@@ IES AND DI@@ SE@@ AS@@ ES ARE C@@ OVER@@ ED@@ ?
The Fund covers occ@@ upational diseases and work@@ place in@@ j@@ uri@@ es.
Occupational diseases are ill@@ nesses caused by substan@@ ces or conditions that the worker was ex@@ posed to at the work@@ pla@@ ce.
You can claim comp@@ ensation if you are ex@@ posed to these working conditions and then get the related diseas@@ e.
The working conditions and diseases caused by these conditions that are cover@@ ed by the Comp@@ ensation Fund are set out in Schedule 3 of the Ac@@ t.
You can claim for other disease if you can pro@@ ve using medical evidence and reports that the disease was caused by conditions at work.
The Fund also covers injur@@ ies that were sustain@@ ed as a result of work or at the work@@ pla@@ ce.
WHAT CAN B@@ E C@@ LA@@ I@@ ME@@ D@@ ?
There are five kin@@ ds of comp@@ ens@@ ation:
* T@@ em@@ por@@ ary dis@@ ability
* Per@@ man@@ ent dis@@ ability
* De@@ ath
* Medical exp@@ ens@@ es
* Ad@@ di@@ tional comp@@ ensation
The Comp@@ ensation Fund does not pay for pa@@ in and su@@ ffer@@ ing, only for lo@@ ss of mo@@ vement or use of your bo@@ d@@ y.
The amount of comp@@ ensation that will be paid to the worker depend@@ s on how much the worker was ear@@ ning when the injur@@ y was sustain@@ ed or the disease diagno@@ s@@ ed.
If you are have st@@ op@@ p@@ ed working by the time a disease is diagno@@ s@@ ed, the comp@@ ensation will be work@@ ed out according to what you would have been ear@@ n@@ ing.
TE@@ M@@ POR@@ ARY DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TY
What is temporary dis@@ abili@@ ty@@ ?
T@@ em@@ por@@ ary dis@@ ability is when you are unable to work or cannot do all your work because of an injur@@ y or disease but you will get bet@@ ter.
To claim for th@@ is, you need to be put off work by a doctor for more than three da@@ ys.
If you are put off work for longer than three da@@ ys, you will get paid out for the who@@ le time that you are unable to work (@@ including the first three da@@ ys@@ ).
What do you get pa@@ id@@ ?
If you cannot work at all, you will get paid out 75@@ % (@@ Â@@ ¾@@ ) of your normal month@@ ly or week@@ ly wa@@ ge.
If you can only do some of your work@@ , you will still get paid some w@@ ages by your employ@@ er.
The Fund will pay you 75@@ % (@@ Â@@ ¾@@ ) of the differ@@ ence between what you go@@ t paid and what you would have been paid before the injur@@ y.
All medical exp@@ ens@@ es are also paid if the accoun@@ ts are submitted to the C@@ ommission@@ er.
How long can you claim for@@ ?
You can claim comp@@ ensation for temporary dis@@ ability for 12 month@@ s.
This can be exten@@ ded to 24 month@@ s.
Af@@ ter 24 months the C@@ ommissioner may decide that the condi@@ tion is permanent and grant comp@@ ensation on the basis of permanent dis@@ abili@@ ty.
PER@@ MAN@@ EN@@ T DI@@ SA@@ BI@@ LI@@ TY
What is permanent dis@@ abili@@ ty@@ ?
A permanent dis@@ ability is an injur@@ y or illness that the worker will ne@@ ver rec@@ over fro@@ m, for example, lo@@ sing an e@@ y@@ e.
The serious of the dis@@ ability will determine whether the worker will ne@@ ver be able to work ag@@ ain or whether they will find work more diffic@@ ult@@ .
Dis@@ abili@@ ties are r@@ ated from 100@@ % to 1@@ % dep@@ ending on the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess.
For example, a 100@@ % would be the lo@@ ss of both your hand@@ s or the lo@@ ss of your si@@ gh@@ t.
The lo@@ ss of your small toe is a 1@@ % dis@@ abili@@ ty.
Your doctor will w@@ ri@@ te a medical report about the dis@@ abili@@ ty.
The C@@ ommissioner and various other doc@@ tors will then decide how serious the dis@@ ability is.
How much comp@@ ensation do you ge@@ t@@ ?
If the dis@@ ability is more than a 30@@ % dis@@ abili@@ ty, you will get paid a month@@ ly pen@@ sion.
The size of the pen@@ sion depend@@ s on what your w@@ ages were and on the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of the dis@@ abili@@ ty.
If you have a 100@@ % dis@@ ability you will get paid 75@@ % (@@ Â@@ ¾ ) of your wag@@ es.
If the dis@@ ability is less ser@@ i@@ ou@@ s, the following form@@ ula is used to work out the month@@ ly pay@@ ment@@ : [@@ w@@ ages * (@@ 75 Ã@@ · 100@@ )@@ ] * (@@ dis@@ abili@@ ty@@ % Ã@@ · 100@@ ).
If the dis@@ ability is less than a 30@@ % dis@@ abili@@ ty, you will get paid a l@@ um@@ p sum@@ .
How long will the comp@@ ensation be paid for@@ ?
The l@@ um@@ p su@@ m payment is a once off pay@@ ment.
The month@@ ly payment will be paid for the rest of the work@@ er's lif@@ e.
DE@@ A@@ TH B@@ EN@@ EF@@ IT@@ S
If the bre@@ ad@@ -@@ w@@ inn@@ er in your family was kil@@ led by an occ@@ upational injur@@ y or diseas@@ e, you can claim from the Fun@@ d.
How much can you cla@@ im@@ ?
The amount of comp@@ ensation that you will be paid depend@@ s on your rel@@ ation@@ ship to the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed.
The total amount paid to the family cannot be more than the pen@@ sion the de@@ ce@@ ased worker would have received if he@@ /@@ she was Â@@ ¾ of the work@@ er's w@@ ages per month@@ .
The sp@@ ou@@ se will be pa@@ id@@ :
* a l@@ um@@ ps su@@ m of 2 x Â@@ ¾ of the work@@ er's w@@ ages
* a month@@ ly pen@@ sion for life of 40@@ % x Â@@ ¾ of the work@@ er's wag@@ es.
The work@@ er's children under the age of 18 (@@ including il@@ leg@@ iti@@ m@@ ate, adopted and ste@@ p childr@@ en@@ ) are entitled to a month@@ ly pen@@ sion of 20@@ % x Â@@ ¾ of the worker wag@@ es.
This is paid every month@@ ly until the child is 18 years ol@@ d.
This pen@@ sion can continue for longer if the child is ment@@ ally or physi@@ cally han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed.
If there is no sp@@ ou@@ se or childr@@ en, other depend@@ ents will be paid comp@@ ensation (for example, paren@@ ts@@ ).
People who were fully dependent on the worker get the same as the wid@@ ow@@ .
People who were parti@@ ally dependent on the worker get a once off payment that depend@@ s on how dependent they were on the work@@ er.
The person who pa@@ ys for the fun@@ er@@ al exp@@ ens@@ es will be paid exp@@ ens@@ es up to R@@ 6 9@@ 70@@ .
To claim comp@@ ensation for the death of a family m@@ em@@ ber@@ , you need to provide certified copies of@@ :
* marriage certificate
* childr@@ en's birth certific@@ ates
* death certificate
* declaration by the sp@@ ou@@ se (@@ form WC@@ L@@ 3@@ 2)
* the employ@@ er's incid@@ ent report
* fun@@ er@@ al accoun@@ ts (@@ form WC@@ L@@ 46@@ )
* details of your income and proper@@ ty.

WHAT IS THE RO@@ A@@ D AC@@ CI@@ D@@ EN@@ T F@@ UN@@ D@@ ?
If a person is in@@ j@@ ured or kil@@ led in a motor vehicle accident because a d@@ riv@@ er involved in the accident was neg@@ ligen@@ t, they or their family can claim comp@@ ensation from the Road Accid@@ ent Fund (R@@ AF@@ ).
This means that even if the d@@ riv@@ er of the c@@ ar do@@ es@@ n@@ 't have ins@@ ur@@ ance, you can get money to help you pay for your medical exp@@ ens@@ es and to comp@@ ens@@ ate for the time that you are unable to work.
The Road Accid@@ ent Fund is a public enti@@ ty which has been set up to pay comp@@ ensation to people in@@ j@@ ured in road accid@@ ents or the depend@@ ants of people kil@@ led in road accid@@ ents ar@@ ising from the neg@@ lig@@ ent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.
The Fund gets its money from a fu@@ el lev@@ y that is inclu@@ ded in the p@@ ric@@ e of p@@ etro@@ l and dies@@ el@@ .
WH@@ O CAN C@@ LA@@ I@@ M F@@ RO@@ M THE F@@ UN@@ D@@ ?
* You can claim if you were in@@ j@@ ured in the accid@@ ent.
* Your depend@@ ents can claim if you were kil@@ led in the accid@@ ent.
* You can claim if you were involved in an accident as a dri@@ ver, a p@@ assen@@ ger or a p@@ ed@@ es@@ tri@@ an@@ .
There is only a claim if the accident was caused by someone el@@ se@@ 's neg@@ lig@@ ent d@@ riv@@ ing.
You cannot claim if you caused the accid@@ ent.
You also can@@ 't claim if you were the only person and vehicle involved in the accid@@ ent, for example if you dro@@ ve into a po@@ le.
If you were the d@@ riv@@ er in the accident but are not the own@@ er of the c@@ ar and the accident was caused by the own@@ er of the car@@ 's neg@@ ligen@@ ce (for example, if they did@@ n@@ 't fi@@ x the br@@ ak@@ es) and you are in@@ j@@ ure@@ d, then you can claim from the fun@@ d.
WHAT CAN Y@@ OU GE@@ T M@@ ON@@ E@@ Y FOR@@ ?
If you are in@@ j@@ ured in an accid@@ ent, you can claim for@@ :
* your medical exp@@ ens@@ es
* fun@@ er@@ al exp@@ ens@@ es
* comp@@ ensation for pa@@ in, suff@@ ering and dis@@ fi@@ g@@ ure@@ ment
* lo@@ st ear@@ n@@ ings
* Cla@@ ims for lo@@ ss of support - If the bre@@ ad@@ w@@ inn@@ er in the family dies in an accident caused by someone el@@ se, then the depend@@ ants of that person can claim for lo@@ ss of sup@@ por@@ t.
If you were part@@ ly responsible for the accident then you can still claim but you will only receive a por@@ tion of the dam@@ ag@@ es.
For example, if you were 50@@ % respon@@ si@@ ble@@ , then you will only get 50@@ % of the dam@@ ag@@ es.
If you were 25@@ % respon@@ si@@ ble@@ , then you will get 75@@ % of the dam@@ ag@@ es.
You cannot claim for dam@@ age done to your vehicle or proper@@ ty.
To get money for th@@ is, you need to su@@ e the d@@ riv@@ er of the vehicle that caused the accid@@ ent.
WHAT IS NE@@ G@@ LIG@@ EN@@ C@@ E?
You do this by pro@@ ving that the d@@ riv@@ er di@@ d not dri@@ ve their vehicle in a way in which a reasonable d@@ riv@@ er would have d@@ riv@@ en in the circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
HOW M@@ UC@@ H M@@ ON@@ E@@ Y CAN Y@@ OU C@@ LA@@ I@@ M FOR@@ ?
If you were not in the vehicle that caused the accid@@ ent, there is no li@@ mit to the dam@@ ages you can claim from the Road Accid@@ ent Fun@@ d.
If you or your bre@@ ad@@ w@@ inn@@ er was a p@@ assen@@ ger in the c@@ ar which caused the accid@@ ent, you cannot claim more than R@@ 25 000 al@@ toge@@ th@@ er.
You can only claim back money that you have sp@@ ent or will sp@@ end because of the accid@@ ent, for example hospital and doc@@ tor@@ 's b@@ ills that you have pa@@ id@@ .
If you or your bre@@ ad@@ w@@ inn@@ er was a pay@@ ing p@@ assen@@ ger or if you were in the c@@ ar because of work@@ , you can only claim R@@ 25 000@@ , but you can su@@ e the neg@@ lig@@ ent d@@ riv@@ er for any money over that@@ .
You cannot su@@ e your employ@@ er, ho@@ we@@ ver@@ .
HOW L@@ ON@@ G DO@@ ES I@@ T TA@@ KE FOR A C@@ LA@@ I@@ M TO B@@ E PRO@@ C@@ ES@@ SE@@ D@@ ?
Cla@@ im@@ ing from the Fund is a comp@@ lic@@ ated process and the Fund has a lo@@ t of cla@@ ims to hand@@ le, so it can take a long time for your money to be paid ou@@ t.
The Fund has 120 days to investigate the matter after the claim has been lo@@ d@@ ge@@ d, before the fin@@ al proceed@@ ings can go a@@ he@@ ad@@ .
HOW DO Y@@ OU C@@ LA@@ I@@ M F@@ RO@@ M THE F@@ UN@@ D@@ ?
You can claim from the Fund y@@ our@@ self or you can get a la@@ wy@@ er to claim for you but you will have to pay for their services.
There are information officers at all RA@@ F offic@@ es that can help you free of char@@ ge.
You must make the claim within three years of the date of the accid@@ ent, if you know who caused the accid@@ ent.
If you don@@ 't know who the d@@ riv@@ er or own@@ er of the vehicle that caused the accident was@@ , you need to claim within two years.

M@@ ental health is not mer@@ ely about the ab@@ s@@ ence of mental ill@@ n@@ ess, but ra@@ ther the pres@@ ence of mental health and well@@ be@@ ing.
M@@ ental health is about how you fe@@ el about y@@ our@@ self@@ , how you rela@@ te to oth@@ ers and how you deal with the opportun@@ iti@@ es, diffic@@ ul@@ ties and chall@@ eng@@ es of ever@@ y@@ day lif@@ e.

M@@ ental Health is about fin@@ ding a bal@@ ance between de@@ aling with the diffic@@ ul@@ ties in life and using the opportunities life pres@@ ents for further develop@@ ment.

Some str@@ ess can be chall@@ en@@ ging and en@@ jo@@ y@@ able (@@ a new j@@ ob@@ , different responsibi@@ li@@ ti@@ es@@ ).

WHAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH PRO@@ B@@ LE@@ M OR MENTAL I@@ LL@@ N@@ ES@@ S@@ ?
M@@ ental health problems sp@@ an a wi@@ de range of condi@@ tions, from mil@@ der conditions that could benefit from e@@ asi@@ ly at@@ tain@@ able changes in li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le and str@@ ess levels to more se@@ ver@@ e conditions which may require hospit@@ alisation and on@@ going regula@@ r treatment to en@@ able you to manage every day life at home and at work.
Some conditions are more li@@ kel@@ y to appe@@ ar at specific perio@@ d@@ s, for example post@@ -@@ nat@@ al de@@ pres@@ sion in new mo@@ th@@ ers, mental det@@ eri@@ or@@ ation (@@ De@@ men@@ ti@@ a) in the el@@ der@@ ly.

People may a@@ vo@@ id de@@ aling with their mental health proble@@ m or emo@@ tional diffic@@ ul@@ ties by "@@ self medic@@ at@@ ing@@ "@@ : They may do this by ex@@ ces@@ sive use of over the coun@@ ter or prescribed medic@@ ation, al@@ cohol or other dr@@ ug@@ s.
Whi@@ le this may provide temporary re@@ li@@ ef from sympt@@ om@@ s, it can also le@@ ad to problems of addi@@ c@@ tion without addres@@ sing the under@@ ly@@ ing proble@@ m.
You may need help to stop if you have already star@@ ted this practi@@ ce.
People with mental health problems may not se@@ ek se@@ ek@@ ing the help they ne@@ ed, because of be@@ li@@ ef@@ s that mental illness is a sign of personal we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess, la@@ z@@ in@@ ess, social un@@ accep@@ t@@ ability or "@@ wis@@ h@@ ful th@@ ink@@ ing@@ "@@ .
The fac@@ ts are clear@@ : M@@ ental ill@@ n@@ ess, like physical ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es, can affec@@ t any@@ on@@ e.
M@@ ental health problems are pa@@ inf@@ ul and can h@@ ur@@ t as much as a physical injur@@ y, and it is best to ob@@ tain help early to promote the ful@@ l@@ est possible rec@@ over@@ y.
The so@@ on@@ er you ob@@ tain hel@@ p, the so@@ on@@ er you may fe@@ el bet@@ ter.
The first ste@@ p to ob@@ taining help is to acc@@ ept that ge@@ tting help is the right thing to do@@ !
Help or advice on where to go for your particular mental health problems may be obtained from y@@ our@@ :
* school or relig@@ ious counsel@@ l@@ or
* local doctor
* local community health centre or mo@@ bi@@ le clinic
* workers clinic or health si@@ ster
* social work@@ ers, psy@@ cho@@ log@@ is@@ ts, psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tr@@ is@@ ts and other health profes@@ sion@@ al@@ s.

* Mak@@ ing government information on services more acces@@ sible to all
* Acc@@ eler@@ ating the legislative process for the Western Cape Youth Commission Bill and the Provincial Development Council Bill
* Inter@@ ven@@ ing to ensure the re-@@ op@@ ening of the Nov@@ el fac@@ tory in Atlantis
CAPE AC@@ C@@ ESS
Cape Access is aimed at provide the po@@ or@@ er people of our province (@@ who cannot af@@ ford compu@@ ter@@ s) access to compu@@ ter@@ s, the intern@@ et, e-@@ mail@@ , and information on government servic@@ es, currently found on the Cape Gateway port@@ al.
Cape Access has two projects which h@@ ope to do th@@ is:
* The R@@ ural Community Access Project
* The Libraries Project
* Bit@@ ter@@ fontein
* Van R@@ hyns@@ dorp
* Eli@@ m
* Str@@ uis@@ baai
* B@@ ong@@ al@@ et@@ u
* George
Sim@@ p@@ ly making use of existing facilities may not al@@ ways be suff@@ ici@@ ent, especially in areas where there are few facili@@ ties.
The Libraries Project is therefore aimed at the intro@@ duction of access to compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net in libr@@ ari@@ es.
The libr@@ aries in the six e-@@ community areas were tech@@ n@@ ically assess@@ ed and three were ch@@ os@@ en to pil@@ ot the Libraries Pro@@ jec@@ t.
V@@ alu@@ able l@@ ess@@ ons should be learn@@ t in the pil@@ o@@ ting of these libr@@ ary projec@@ ts, which will guide the exp@@ an@@ sion of the Libraries Pro@@ jec@@ t.
The libr@@ aries ch@@ os@@ en in the 100 days are:
Premier R@@ as@@ ool encour@@ ages citizens to use Cape Gateway to access government information and services

The Bill was then published in the G@@ az@@ ette for com@@ ment within 21 da@@ ys.
Once this period is over@@ , the relevant Committee will consi@@ der the com@@ ments recei@@ v@@ ed, before the fin@@ al Bill is deb@@ ated and pass@@ ed.

The Provincial Development Council Law A@@ mend@@ ment Bill was intro@@ duced to the Provincial Parliament and published in the G@@ az@@ ette for com@@ ment on 18 June 2004, within the 100 days of new government.

The next of the â@@ @@ su@@ peri@@ or cour@@ ts@@ â@@  is the High Court of South Afric@@ a, which used to be called â@@ @@ The Sup@@ re@@ me Cour@@ t@@ â@@ @@ .
The High Court di@@ visi@@ ons have â@@ @@ juris@@ dic@@ tion@@ â@@  â the right to he@@ ar a case â over defined geo@@ graph@@ ical areas in which they are situ@@ ate@@ d, and the deci@@ sions of the High Courts are bin@@ ding on mag@@ istr@@ ate@@ 's courts within their areas of juris@@ dic@@ tion.
The High Court di@@ visi@@ ons have juris@@ dic@@ tion over all matters in their geo@@ graph@@ ical are@@ a, but they usually only he@@ ar civil matters invol@@ ving more than R@@ 100 000@@ , and serious criminal cas@@ es.
Im@@ port@@ ant officers in a High Court Di@@ vi@@ sion@@ :
* The Registrar ke@@ ep@@ s all the official court documents
* The Family Ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate must be cons@@ ul@@ ted on all matters invol@@ ving childr@@ en, as the High Court is the â@@ @@ up@@ per guardi@@ an@@ â@@  of all children in South Africa.
* The M@@ aster of the High Court ke@@ ep@@ s all the records relating to peop@@ le@@ 's est@@ ates (@@ de@@ ce@@ ased or in@@ sol@@ ven@@ t@@ ).
* The Sher@@ if@@ f deliver@@ s certain documents to the parties in a civil cas@@ e, and also att@@ ach@@ es property when a war@@ ran@@ t is issu@@ ed.
* The Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions, who used to be called the At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y-@@ Gener@@ al, is responsible for criminal prosecu@@ tions by the state@@ .
* The State At@@ tor@@ ney is the la@@ wy@@ er who repres@@ ents the state in civil ac@@ tions (@@ where the state is su@@ ing or being su@@ ed@@ ).
There are at the mo@@ ment ten â@@ @@ provincial divi@@ sion@@ s@@ â@@  of the High Court and three â@@ @@ local divi@@ sion@@ s@@ â@@  (@@ which have con@@ current geo@@ graph@@ ical juris@@ dic@@ tion over an area within a divi@@ sion@@ ).
These still use names which rela@@ te to the old provincial and hom@@ el@@ and structure of South Africa before 199@@ 4.
For example, the di@@ vision of the High Court in Cape Town is called â@@ @@ The High Court of South Africa@@ : Cape of G@@ ood H@@ ope Provincial Di@@ vision and its J@@ ud@@ ge President is J@@ ud@@ ge Joh@@ n H@@ lop@@ he@@ .
The present thir@@ teen di@@ visi@@ ons and local di@@ visi@@ ons of the High Court are situ@@ ated in:

The Tr@@ u@@ th and Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ation Commission (@@ TR@@ C) was not a court as such but a different kind of forum set up to deal with cri@@ mes related to poli@@ tics commit@@ ted during ap@@ ar@@ th@@ eid@@ .
The A@@ m@@ n@@ es@@ ty Committee had the power to grant am@@ n@@ es@@ ty (@@ which means the per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ator cannot be prosecu@@ te@@ d@@ ) for poli@@ tic@@ ally mo@@ tiv@@ ated cri@@ mes fully and tr@@ u@@ th@@ fully conf@@ ess@@ ed, under certain condi@@ tions.
The Human Rights Vi@@ ol@@ ation Committee deci@@ ded on acts which constitu@@ ted viol@@ ations of human righ@@ ts, based on state@@ ments made to the TR@@ C@@ .
Once vic@@ ti@@ ms of gro@@ ss human rights viol@@ ations are identi@@ fi@@ ed, they were referred to the Re@@ par@@ ation and Rehabilitation Comm@@ itte@@ e, which deci@@ des on how to comp@@ ens@@ ate vic@@ ti@@ m@@ s.

The Magistr@@ at@@ es@@ â@@  Courts are the low@@ er courts which deal with most mat@@ ter@@ s.
They are divi@@ ded into regional courts and district cour@@ ts.
There are more than 400 mag@@ istr@@ at@@ es@@ â@@  courts in South Africa.
They do not have juris@@ dic@@ tion to deal with civil matters de@@ aling with more than R@@ 100 000 (@@ unless both the person su@@ ing and the person being su@@ ed ag@@ ree to li@@ mit the claim to less than R@@ 100 000@@ ).
Wit@@ h criminal cas@@ es, more serious criminal matters are he@@ ard in the regional cour@@ ts.
This is because district courts cannot pas@@ s a sen@@ ten@@ ce of more than three years on con@@ vic@@ tion of an acc@@ us@@ ed.
The most serious criminal matters are he@@ ard in the High Cour@@ t.
There are also a number of mag@@ istr@@ at@@ es@@ â@@  courts that are specialised to be better able to deal with certain types of mat@@ ter@@ s, such as the rap@@ e court in Wyn@@ ber@@ g.
You can view a list of Magistr@@ ate@@ 's Courts in the Western Cape her@@ e.
Small Cla@@ ims Courts have juris@@ dic@@ tion to he@@ ar any civil matter invol@@ ving less than R@@ 3@@ 000 (@@ unless both the person su@@ ing and the person being su@@ ed ag@@ ree to li@@ mit the claim to less R@@ 3@@ 000@@ ).
The judge in the Small Cla@@ ims Court is called a commissioner and is usually a practi@@ sing ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate, at@@ tor@@ ney or a legal ac@@ ademi@@ c who acts as a commissioner free of char@@ ge.
N@@ either the plain@@ ti@@ f@@ f (@@ the person su@@ ing) n@@ or the def@@ end@@ ant (@@ the person being su@@ ed@@ ) are allow@@ ed to have la@@ wy@@ ers in the cas@@ e.
The c@@ ommission@@ er's decision is fin@@ al and there is no appeal to a higher cour@@ t.
You can contact your nearest Small Cla@@ ims Court through your nearest Magistr@@ ate@@ 's Cour@@ t.
Community Courts and Courts for Chi@@ ef@@ s and He@@ ad@@ m@@ en also have juris@@ dic@@ tion to he@@ ar certain matters on the level of mag@@ istr@@ at@@ es@@ â@@  cour@@ ts.
They are designed to deal with customary disp@@ u@@ tes in terms of customary law@@ .
An author@@ ised African he@@ ad@@ man or his deputy may decide cases using indigenous law and custom@@ , b@@ rou@@ ght before him by an African against another African within his area of juris@@ dic@@ tion.
These courts are comm@@ only kno@@ wn as chi@@ ef@@ 's cour@@ ts.
A person with a claim has the right to choo@@ se whether to bring a claim in the chi@@ ef@@ 's court or in a mag@@ istr@@ ate@@ 's cour@@ t.

KE@@ E@@ P IN TO@@ UC@@ H WIT@@ H Y@@ OU@@ R BO@@ D@@ Y AND BE@@ AT BRE@@ AS@@ T C@@ AN@@ C@@ ER
* Western So@@ ci@@ e@@ ties have the high@@ est incid@@ ence of bre@@ ast canc@@ er, 60 -@@ 70 per 100 000 wo@@ men@@ .
* Bre@@ ast cancer is the most comm@@ only diagno@@ sed non-@@ der@@ mat@@ o@@ logical cancer in women and currently the le@@ ading c@@ ause of cancer incid@@ ence among women in South Africa (@@ 16@@ .@@ 6 %@@ ).
* It is the number 1 cancer diagno@@ sis among the Whi@@ te and A@@ si@@ an f@@ em@@ ale pop@@ ul@@ ations (@@ 17@@ .@@ 9@@ % and 24@@ .@@ 4@@ % respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ ), exclu@@ ding sk@@ in canc@@ er.
* Bet@@ ween 1993 and 1995 an annual a@@ ver@@ age of 3 78@@ 5 new cases were diagno@@ s@@ ed.
* E@@ very w@@ om@@ an is at risk for Bre@@ ast Canc@@ er.
The risk increase with age.
* M@@ any risk fac@@ tors have been identified for Bre@@ ast Canc@@ er.
However, all these only account for about 1@@ /@@ 3 of the incid@@ ence.
All other cases remain un@@ ex@@ plain@@ ed, and are being res@@ earch@@ ed through glob@@ al initi@@ ativ@@ es.
* To d@@ ate, knowledge about risk fac@@ tors has not trans@@ lated into practi@@ cal ways to prevent Bre@@ ast Cancer therefore the best way to re@@ duce mor@@ ta@@ lity from Bre@@ ast Cancer is through early de@@ tec@@ tion.
* M@@ any the@@ or@@ ies su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that possible ca@@ uses include gene@@ tic@@ s, di@@ et@@ ary, environmental fac@@ tor@@ s, hor@@ m@@ one activ@@ ity or a com@@ bin@@ ation of all th@@ re@@ e.
* Women find 9 O@@ ut of 10 l@@ um@@ ps them sel@@ v@@ es.
* Mo@@ st l@@ um@@ ps (@@ appro@@ xim@@ ately 80@@ %@@ ) are not ma@@ lig@@ n@@ ant but occ@@ asion@@ ally a l@@ um@@ p may be an early sign of Bre@@ ast Canc@@ er.
Any change ho@@ we@@ ver does need to be chec@@ ked by a doc@@ tor.
* Bre@@ ast disease is ex@@ tre@@ mel@@ y comm@@ on.

Bre@@ ast Sel@@ f Ex@@ am
This bro@@ ch@@ ure contains reasons for do@@ ing a bre@@ ast self examin@@ ation on a regula@@ r basi@@ s.
RE@@ M@@ EM@@ BE@@ R
However, most l@@ um@@ ps dis@@ cover@@ ed in the bre@@ ast are not canc@@ er.
B@@ e saf@@ e, be su@@ re@@ .
WH@@ EN TO DO A BRE@@ AS@@ T SE@@ L@@ F@@ -@@ E@@ X@@ A@@ M
The best time to do a bre@@ ast self@@ -@@ ex@@ am is right after your perio@@ d, when your bre@@ ast@@ s are not tender or sw@@ ol@@ l@@ en.
If you do not have regula@@ r perio@@ ds or some@@ times sk@@ i@@ p a month@@ , do the ex@@ am on the same day every month@@ .
HOW TO DO A BRE@@ AS@@ T SE@@ L@@ F@@ -@@ E@@ X@@ A@@ M
1. Li@@ e down and put a pil@@ low under your right s@@ hou@@ l@@ der.
Pla@@ ce your right arm be@@ hin@@ d your he@@ ad@@ .
2. U@@ se the f@@ ing@@ er p@@ ads of your three mid@@ d@@ le f@@ ing@@ ers on your le@@ f@@ t hand to fe@@ el for l@@ um@@ ps or th@@ ic@@ ken@@ ing.
Your f@@ ing@@ er p@@ ads are the to@@ p third of each f@@ ing@@ er.
3. Pres@@ s fir@@ m@@ ly en@@ ough to know how your bre@@ ast fe@@ el@@ s.
If you@@ '@@ re not sure how h@@ ard to pres@@ s, ask your health care provi@@ der.
O@@ r try to copy the way your health care provi@@ der uses the f@@ ing@@ er p@@ ads during a bre@@ ast exam@@ .
Lear@@ n what your bre@@ ast fe@@ els like most of the time.
A fir@@ m ri@@ dge in the low@@ er cur@@ ve of each bre@@ ast is norm@@ al.
4. Mo@@ ve around the bre@@ ast in a set wa@@ y.
You can choo@@ se either the circ@@ le (@@ A@@ ), the up and down line (@@ B@@ ), or the w@@ ed@@ ge (C@@ ).
Do it the same way every time.
It will help you to make sure that you@@ '@@ ve g@@ one over the enti@@ re bre@@ ast are@@ a, and to re@@ member how your bre@@ ast fe@@ el@@ s.
5. No@@ w exam@@ ine your le@@ f@@ t bre@@ ast using your right hand f@@ ing@@ er pad@@ s.
6. If you find any chan@@ ges@@ , see your doctor right a@@ wa@@ y.
FOR AD@@ DE@@ D SA@@ FE@@ TY
You should also check your bre@@ ast@@ s while standing in f@@ ron@@ t of a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r right after you do your bre@@ ast self@@ -@@ ex@@ am each month@@ .
S@@ ee if there are any changes in the way your bre@@ ast@@ s loo@@ k: di@@ m@@ pl@@ ing of the sk@@ in, changes in the ni@@ p@@ ple, or red@@ ness or sw@@ ell@@ ing.
You mi@@ ght also want to do a bre@@ ast self@@ -@@ ex@@ am while you@@ '@@ re in the sho@@ wer@@ .
Your so@@ ap@@ y hand@@ s will g@@ li@@ de over the wet sk@@ in making it e@@ as@@ y to check how your bre@@ ast@@ s fe@@ el@@ .

FA@@ C@@ TS A@@ BO@@ U@@ T C@@ ERVIC@@ AL C@@ AN@@ C@@ ER
* Cancer of the cer@@ vi@@ x is the comm@@ on@@ est cancer am@@ ong@@ st South African wo@@ men@@ .
* One in 41 women in South Africa will develop this cancer during her li@@ fe@@ time.

S@@ creening as above has been sho@@ wn to re@@ duce the mor@@ ta@@ lity from c@@ ervic@@ al cancer by 67@@ % and is considered to be the most co@@ st@@ -@@ effective op@@ tion for South Africa.
* If a w@@ om@@ an has specific symptoms or a previously ab@@ normal s@@ me@@ ar or there are c@@ lin@@ ical indic@@ ations, she may have free c@@ ervic@@ al s@@ me@@ ars in addi@@ tion to the th@@ re@@ e.
* If a w@@ om@@ an wan@@ ts more than three rou@@ t@@ ine s@@ creening s@@ me@@ ar@@ s, she must pay for the ex@@ tr@@ a on@@ es h@@ ers@@ elf@@ .

iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o is Western Cape Provin@@ ce@@ 's strategy for addres@@ sing the needs of the peop@@ le.
I@@ ts pri@@ ority is to increase support to the po@@ or, while at the same time ens@@ uring that a lar@@ ger number of people can ga@@ in income through paid employ@@ ment.
The go@@ als of iKapa eli@@ hlumay@@ o are to re@@ duce un@@ employ@@ ment, p@@ over@@ ty and income in@@ equ@@ ality by sti@@ m@@ ula@@ ting economic growth and participation in the province.
Gre@@ ater provincial sp@@ ending on skills development and inves@@ tment in lar@@ ge infrastructure projects will be used to at@@ tract private inves@@ tment and sti@@ m@@ ula@@ te the econom@@ y.
The Province will bal@@ ance this l@@ ong@@ -@@ term strategy by increas@@ ed support of the poor through the payment of gr@@ ants and impro@@ ved delivery of social services.
HI@@ ST@@ OR@@ IC@@ AL B@@ AC@@ K@@ GR@@ O@@ UN@@ D
South Africa@@ 's first demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ c election in 1994 resul@@ ted in a new political disp@@ ensation with n@@ ine new Provin@@ ces.
B@@ ut there were no provincial structures in place to bring about the necessary transform@@ ation.
We had to create a Provin@@ ce, and a key part of this was the cre@@ ation of a working Treasur@@ y - so the Western Cape Provincial Treasur@@ y was bor@@ n on 1 April 1995 as part of the new Finance and Corpor@@ ate Services Depart@@ ment.
It was also char@@ ged with ens@@ uring that si@@ mi@@ lar govern@@ ance structures c@@ ame about in the Nor@@ thern and E@@ astern Cape Provin@@ ces.
The r@@ un@@ ning of the provincial government depend@@ s he@@ avi@@ ly on the pro@@ per func@@ tion@@ ing of the Provincial Treasur@@ y.
To ensure that the Western Cape was oper@@ ating eff@@ ici@@ ently and effecti@@ vel@@ y, the Department emb@@ ar@@ ked up@@ on a process of res@@ tr@@ uc@@ t@@ uring to syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ise its structure with the National Treasur@@ y.
The res@@ tr@@ uc@@ t@@ uring process required policy objec@@ tives and strategi@@ c objec@@ tives to be identified and b@@ rou@@ ght into oper@@ ation.
This was done by cre@@ ating specialised compon@@ en@@ ts, such as Public Finance and Ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ing, As@@ set Man@@ age@@ ment, Human Resource Management and Resource Man@@ age@@ ment.

What are Family G@@ rou@@ p Con@@ fer@@ enc@@ es@@ ?
Family G@@ rou@@ p Con@@ fer@@ ences are one of the many res@@ tor@@ ative justice mechanis@@ ms used to re@@ integr@@ ate young off@@ en@@ ders into soci@@ et@@ y.
This sh@@ ort arti@@ c@@ le ex@@ plain@@ s in more det@@ ail what family group con@@ fer@@ ences are and how they work.
WHAT IS A FA@@ MI@@ L@@ Y GR@@ OU@@ P CON@@ F@@ ER@@ EN@@ C@@ E?
The family group con@@ fer@@ ence is a res@@ tor@@ ative justice mechanis@@ m by which fam@@ i@@ lies and communities are involved in making deci@@ sions about children who are acc@@ used of cri@@ m@@ es.
The family group con@@ fer@@ ence aims for neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ated so@@ lu@@ tions to conflic@@ t.
It is designed to he@@ al the bre@@ ach in social rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps caused by the cri@@ me.
The family group con@@ fer@@ ence was p@@ ion@@ eer@@ ed in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in the 19@@ 80@@ s during the re@@ form of their ju@@ ven@@ ile justice syste@@ m.
It is a form of res@@ tor@@ ative justice that was de@@ vis@@ ed after consult@@ ation with the public@@ , including Ma@@ or@@ is and P@@ aci@@ fic Is@@ lan@@ der@@ s, throughout New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and@@ .
The first ste@@ p is that the child must ac@@ knowledge responsibility for his or her ac@@ tions.
The family group con@@ fer@@ ence it@@ self is a me@@ eting of all the people who are sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant in the child's lif@@ e, as well as the vic@@ ti@@ m and the persons sup@@ por@@ tive of the vic@@ ti@@ m.
The main go@@ al of the con@@ fer@@ ence is to form@@ ula@@ te a plan about how best to put the w@@ ron@@ g, righ@@ t.
All the parties ag@@ ree to the even@@ tual out@@ com@@ e.
The parties mi@@ ght agre@@ e, for example, that the child should ap@@ o@@ log@@ is@@ e, or re@@ place what has been st@@ ol@@ en.
Con@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing is per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved to be especially sui@@ ted to young off@@ en@@ der@@ s, as it allow@@ s for early intervention in what may otherwise become a criminal c@@ are@@ er.
Children may also be more amen@@ able and respon@@ sive to the proc@@ ess, which invol@@ ves making them as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of their ac@@ tions, as their person@@ ali@@ ties are still develop@@ ing, and the process invol@@ ves people close to them such as their parents and famili@@ es.
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ a, C@@ an@@ ad@@ a, the Uni@@ ted St@@ ates and the Uni@@ ted K@@ ing@@ d@@ om have all pil@@ o@@ ted some form of family group or community con@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing as di@@ ver@@ sion or sen@@ ten@@ cing op@@ tions.
In South Afric@@ a, N@@ IC@@ R@@ O first beg@@ an intro@@ duc@@ ing the ide@@ a of di@@ ver@@ sion of children a@@ way from the criminal justice system in 199@@ 2, using the conc@@ ep@@ ts of res@@ tor@@ ative j@@ us@@ tic@@ e.
In 1995 the Inter@@ -@@ Minister@@ i@@ al Committee on Y@@ oung People at R@@ is@@ k set up a pil@@ ot family group con@@ fer@@ ence in Pretori@@ a.
Other South African p@@ ion@@ eers of family group con@@ fer@@ ences are the Ste@@ p@@ ping St@@ on@@ es Project in P@@ ort Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th, the Dur@@ ban Ass@@ ess@@ ment, Rec@@ ep@@ tion and Ref@@ er@@ r@@ al Centre, the North West Province Department of Social Servic@@ es, Ar@@ ts, Culture and S@@ port, and the Res@@ tor@@ ative Justice Centre@@ .
The Child Justice Bill provides for family group con@@ fer@@ ences to be a res@@ tor@@ ative justice sen@@ ten@@ cing op@@ tion.
In terms of the Bill a court may confir@@ m, sub@@ stitu@@ te or amen@@ d the recommend@@ ation ar@@ ising from a family group con@@ fer@@ ence.
If the court does not confir@@ m the recommend@@ ation, it must note its reason@@ s.
S@@ hould a child not comply with the recommend@@ ation as confir@@ med by the cour@@ t, the pro@@ b@@ ation officer must noti@@ fy the cour@@ t, and a war@@ ran@@ t of ar@@ rest for the child may be issu@@ ed.

Some of the most common ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nesses are as@@ thma and high bl@@ ood pres@@ sure (@@ hy@@ per@@ ten@@ sion@@ ).
* H@@ y@@ per@@ ten@@ sion@@ : preven@@ tion, treatment and management
WHAT ARE CH@@ RON@@ I@@ C DI@@ SE@@ AS@@ ES@@ ?
Ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nesses may be in@@ her@@ ite@@ d, but many li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le and environmental fac@@ tors such as s@@ mo@@ k@@ ing, in@@ appropriate di@@ et, lack of exercise and he@@ av@@ y al@@ cohol consum@@ ption are kno@@ wn to sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly increase ris@@ k@@ s.
These fac@@ tors are to some extent within the control of a well@@ -@@ inform@@ ed individu@@ al, but there are often other fac@@ tors such as p@@ over@@ ty, under@@ -@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion during pregn@@ ancy and in inf@@ anc@@ y, gene@@ tic pre@@ di@@ spo@@ si@@ tion and age@@ ing, over which the individual has li@@ tt@@ le or no control@@ .
Bes@@ id@@ es early diagno@@ si@@ s, management and har@@ m re@@ duc@@ tion, a very important a@@ spec@@ t of the service is aimed at pre@@ vention of illness and promotion of health@@ y be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our@@ .
Pri@@ ority ch@@ ron@@ ic diseases are: high bl@@ ood pres@@ sure or hy@@ per@@ ten@@ sion@@ , as@@ th@@ ma@@ , ep@@ i@@ le@@ psy@@ , stro@@ k@@ e, ren@@ al diseas@@ e, canc@@ er, ob@@ struc@@ tive l@@ un@@ g disease and Di@@ a@@ be@@ tes Ty@@ pe 2. (@@ Di@@ a@@ be@@ tes Ty@@ pe 1, which is mo@@ st@@ ly diagno@@ sed in early child@@ hoo@@ d, is less comm@@ on@@ .@@ )
Mo@@ st of these ill@@ nesses are l@@ ong@@ -@@ term and while many cannot be c@@ ure@@ d, they can be control@@ le@@ d.
Whi@@ le people of all ages are affected by ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es, there is a higher risk of the el@@ der@@ ly developing ch@@ ron@@ ic diseas@@ es, this in tur@@ n can result in dis@@ abili@@ ty.
P@@ RE@@ V@@ ENTI@@ ON AND MAN@@ A@@ GE@@ MENT AT PR@@ IM@@ ARY HEALTH C@@ ARE LE@@ VE@@ L
At primary health care level the service is based on pre@@ vention by educ@@ ating people about the benefits of a health@@ y li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le.
E@@ very clinic has a staff member who has the skills to diagno@@ se and manage ch@@ ron@@ ic conditions from young to el@@ der@@ ly cli@@ en@@ ts.
P@@ ati@@ ents are able to see the same n@@ urse for repe@@ at visi@@ ts if they come regul@@ arly on the di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ / hy@@ per@@ ten@@ sion or as@@ thma clinic da@@ y.
They are given a special card or sti@@ c@@ ker on their fol@@ der and this is used to ensure continu@@ ity of car@@ e.
Coun@@ selling and compli@@ ance are also part of the servic@@ e.
Do@@ c@@ tor@@ s@@ /@@ medical officers under@@ take perio@@ di@@ c visi@@ ts from hospitals to clinics to review ch@@ ron@@ ic disease pati@@ en@@ ts.
Ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments are made by the clinic to minim@@ ise patient tr@@ av@@ el (@@ especially by the el@@ der@@ ly@@ ) by prescri@@ b@@ ing supp@@ lies of dr@@ ug@@ s to last one to three month@@ s.
St@@ aff often facilitate the initi@@ ation of c@@ l@@ ub@@ s and special support group@@ s for people with ch@@ ron@@ ic diseas@@ es.
In this way a patient can get more information on special care and health education per@@ taining to their condi@@ tion.
If comp@@ lic@@ ations ar@@ is@@ e, patients will be referred to the next level of car@@ e.
Some exam@@ ples of how ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nesses are preven@@ ted, man@@ aged and treated are given bel@@ ow@@ .
As@@ thma affec@@ ts ad@@ ults and childr@@ en.
It is a ch@@ ron@@ ic inf@@ lam@@ m@@ ation of the air@@ ways caused by an all@@ erg@@ y.
As@@ thma cannot be c@@ ure@@ d, but can be effecti@@ vely man@@ aged by taking preven@@ tive medic@@ ation on a da@@ ily basi@@ s.
Ass@@ ess@@ ment and treatment of ad@@ ults is done at primary health care clinics where clients are examin@@ ed, special tes@@ ts are car@@ ri@@ ed out and treatment is initi@@ ate@@ d.
C@@ li@@ ents are educ@@ ated about how to manage their as@@ thma and inform@@ ed about ag@@ gr@@ av@@ ating fac@@ tors including s@@ mo@@ k@@ ing, lack of exercise and hou@@ se d@@ ust mit@@ es.
C@@ li@@ ents who have se@@ ver@@ e as@@ thma att@@ ac@@ ks may require emergency treatment and refer@@ r@@ al to a hospit@@ al.
H@@ y@@ per@@ ten@@ sion or high bl@@ ood pres@@ sure is a disease of li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le that can be preven@@ ted and tre@@ ate@@ d.
If the bl@@ ood pres@@ sure remain@@ s high for a perio@@ d, serious comp@@ lic@@ ations can develop@@ .
These can invol@@ ve the bl@@ ood v@@ es@@ sel@@ s, the he@@ ar@@ t, the k@@ id@@ ne@@ ys and the e@@ y@@ es.
The result could be stro@@ k@@ e, he@@ ar@@ t disease or k@@ id@@ ney f@@ ail@@ ure and even de@@ ath@@ .
At primary health care level@@ , clients with high bl@@ ood pres@@ sure will be inform@@ ed about how to improve general health and re@@ duce other risk fac@@ tors for he@@ ar@@ t disease e.g. exerc@@ is@@ e, gi@@ ving up s@@ mo@@ k@@ ing, al@@ cohol and dr@@ ug@@ s and cu@@ tting down on sal@@ t in@@ tak@@ e.
If after this the bl@@ ood pres@@ sure remain@@ s high@@ , treatment will be prescri@@ be@@ d.
C@@ li@@ ents must return to the clinic for regula@@ r chec@@ k-@@ up@@ s and medic@@ ation.
S@@ er@@ ious comp@@ lic@@ ations like stro@@ k@@ e, he@@ ar@@ t disease and k@@ id@@ ney f@@ ail@@ ure have to be treated at hospital level@@ .
Ch@@ ron@@ ic care services at all three levels - pri@@ mar@@ y, sec@@ ondary and tertiary - facilitate ge@@ tting social service gr@@ ants to people who need them@@ .
These services are available at all clinics and hospitals throughout the Western Cape.
Fir@@ st@@ -@@ time visi@@ tors to the clinic@@ /@@ sec@@ ondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a fol@@ der will be op@@ ened for the pati@@ ent.
Bring your ID boo@@ k.
A refer@@ r@@ al letter from the clinic will be required when visi@@ ting a hospit@@ al.
Hospitals ask for your most rec@@ ent pa@@ ys@@ li@@ p@@ /@@ income assessment (@@ IR@@ P@@ 5@@ ).
Bring your hospital card if previously registered at the hospit@@ al.

The procedure for mal@@ es is called a vas@@ ec@@ t@@ om@@ y, which is usually done while the man is aw@@ ak@@ e, using local an@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ tic@@ , or a general an@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ tic@@ .
One or two very small op@@ en@@ ings are made in the sk@@ in ne@@ ar the testi@@ c@@ l@@ es.
The vas de@@ fer@@ ens (@@ sper@@ m tu@@ be@@ ), which car@@ ri@@ es sper@@ m from each testi@@ c@@ le, are cu@@ t and ti@@ ed.
The operation is not immedi@@ ately effective and another contrac@@ ep@@ tion metho@@ d is nee@@ ded for three months after the oper@@ ation, or for the next 15@@ -@@ 20 times that the man has s@@ ex@@ .
A confir@@ mat@@ ory test (@@ sper@@ m coun@@ t) is necessary to ensure that the sper@@ m is clear@@ ed from the t@@ ub@@ es.
S@@ teri@@ lis@@ ation does not prevent S@@ exually Trans@@ mitted Inf@@ ec@@ tions (S@@ TI@@ /@@ HIV/@@ A@@ id@@ s@@ ).
As with all contrac@@ ep@@ tive metho@@ d@@ s, there is a small risk of f@@ ail@@ ure@@ .
M@@ ent@@ ally dis@@ abled people can be s@@ teri@@ lis@@ ed in terms of the S@@ teri@@ lis@@ ation Act, 1998 (@@ Act No. 44 of 199@@ 8@@ ).
The par@@ ent, guardi@@ an, cur@@ ator or sp@@ ou@@ se can request the s@@ teri@@ lis@@ ation of a person who is inc@@ ap@@ able of cons@@ enting due to mental dis@@ abili@@ ty.
An application must be made and sent to the relevant hospit@@ al.
An appointment will be made for a pan@@ el consist@@ ing of three mental health profes@@ sion@@ als to ass@@ ess the cli@@ ent, who must be ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by the applic@@ an@@ t.

C@@ ervic@@ al and bre@@ ast cancer are the two most common forms of cancer found am@@ ong@@ st South African women and all women are at risk of developing these canc@@ ers.
C@@ ervic@@ al cancer is one of the most preven@@ table forms of canc@@ er.
All women should have a pa@@ p s@@ me@@ ar at least every 10 years star@@ ting at age 30 years.

WHAT IS TB@@ ?
TB is a bac@@ teri@@ al diseas@@ e, and is a serious proble@@ m in South Afric@@ a, especially in the Western Cape.
TB is high@@ ly infec@@ ti@@ ous but cur@@ ab@@ le.
One out of ten people develop the diseas@@ e.
If not tre@@ ate@@ d, the infec@@ ti@@ ous person can affec@@ t 20 other people or more in a year.
TB spre@@ ads when infected people with p@@ ul@@ mon@@ ary (@@ l@@ un@@ g@@ ) TB c@@ ough tin@@ y dro@@ pl@@ ets contain@@ ing TB into the air@@ , and oth@@ ers bre@@ a@@ the them in.
People who have TB of other parts of the body are not infec@@ ti@@ ou@@ s.
A per@@ si@@ st@@ ent c@@ ough of two weeks or more is the main sign of TB, so the ear@@ lier the cli@@ ent go@@ es to the clinic to get examin@@ ed, the e@@ asi@@ er it is to c@@ ure@@ .
M@@ ore se@@ ver@@ e sign@@ s are c@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing up of bloo@@ d, ni@@ gh@@ ts@@ we@@ at@@ s, lo@@ ss of w@@ eigh@@ t, and sh@@ or@@ t@@ ness of bre@@ ath@@ .
DI@@ AG@@ NO@@ S@@ ING TB
The cli@@ ent is examin@@ ed at a primary health care clinic and asked to give a sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m s@@ ample and another the next da@@ y.
These sam@@ ples are sent to a labor@@ atory and the results are available in 48 h@@ our@@ s.
On@@ ly one of them needs to be positive to indic@@ ate TB infec@@ tion.
If the result is posi@@ tiv@@ e, the cli@@ ent will be counsel@@ led and advis@@ ed on the benefits of being put on the TB control programme.
If both sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m sam@@ ples are posi@@ tiv@@ e, treatment is given immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
An x@@ -@@ ra@@ y may also be tak@@ en, but the sp@@ u@@ tu@@ m tes@@ ts confir@@ m diagno@@ si@@ s.
If the TB infec@@ tion is se@@ ver@@ e, the cli@@ ent will be referred to a speci@@ ali@@ st TB clinic@@ .
TB TR@@ E@@ A@@ T@@ MENT
TB can only be c@@ ured if the full course of treat@@ ment, which can be from six to eight month@@ s, is comple@@ ted.
People who stop treatment are li@@ kel@@ y to develop multi@@ -@@ dr@@ ug res@@ is@@ t@@ ance, making the TB more diffic@@ ult to c@@ ure@@ .
These cases are treated at TB speci@@ ali@@ st clinics e.g. Bro@@ ok@@ lyn Ch@@ est Hospit@@ al.
TB can be f@@ at@@ al if not tre@@ ate@@ d.
Treatment is in two ph@@ as@@ es:
The inten@@ sive phase is when four different dr@@ ug@@ s in tab@@ let form are given for five days a week@@ , for two to three month@@ s.
The second phase is the continu@@ ation ph@@ as@@ e, in which two dr@@ ug@@ s are given for five days a week@@ , for four to five month@@ s.
Fir@@ st@@ -@@ time TB clients must be treated for six month@@ s, while clients who have had TB before must take TB medic@@ ine for eight month@@ s.
If there are side effec@@ ts from the medic@@ ation, the cli@@ ent must return to the clinic@@ .
S@@ pu@@ tu@@ m tes@@ ts are taken ag@@ ain after two months on treatment to check for progres@@ s, and at five or se@@ ven months to confir@@ m whether the cli@@ ent is c@@ ure@@ d.
Children with TB are given different medic@@ ines and treated for four months on@@ ly.
To try and prevent TB, bab@@ ies should be immun@@ ised with the B@@ C@@ G vacc@@ in@@ e, which is available free of charge at all primary health care clinic@@ s.
TB men@@ ing@@ iti@@ s is a serious illness in children and can be f@@ at@@ al.
If suspec@@ ted (@@ symptoms include nec@@ k sti@@ ff@@ n@@ ess@@ ) the child must be taken to the clinic immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
DO@@ TS
The Department of Health has adopted the World Health Organis@@ ation@@ 's DO@@ TS (@@ directly ob@@ serv@@ ed treatment sh@@ ort cour@@ se@@ ) metho@@ d to ensure patients ad@@ here to treat@@ ment.
DO@@ TS has been implemen@@ ted in most clinics in the Western Cape.
An important ele@@ ment of the strategy is the support and encour@@ agement offered to TB clients for the enti@@ re si@@ x@@ - to eigh@@ t-@@ month treatment perio@@ d, where clients are directly ob@@ serv@@ ed taking their medic@@ ation at the clinic@@ .
At community level@@ , DO@@ TS is under@@ taken by non-@@ govern@@ mental organisations (N@@ GO@@ s) using volun@@ te@@ ers as "@@ treatment sup@@ por@@ ters@@ "@@ .
TB N@@ GO@@ s rec@@ r@@ uit@@ , tra@@ in and su@@ per@@ v@@ ise members of communities to function as treatment sup@@ por@@ ters for TB cli@@ en@@ ts.
Sup@@ por@@ ters ref@@ er TB clients to the clinic when necess@@ ary.
The Cape Tech@@ ni@@ kon offers training for people who want to be TB sup@@ por@@ ter@@ s.
Ph@@ one 021 460 3@@ 19@@ 7 for further inform@@ ation.
TB Care Associ@@ ation, S@@ an@@ ta Cape Town and S@@ an@@ ta Western Cape are the three N@@ GO@@ s that deli@@ ver commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based treatment to TB patients in the province.
The provincial government provides financial assistance and support to these N@@ GO@@ s.
TB AND HIV
The HIV ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c has led to an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous increase in the number of TB cas@@ es.
TB, an opportun@@ is@@ tic infec@@ tion, is responsible for a third of all de@@ ath@@ s in HIV@@ -@@ infected peop@@ le.
People with HIV are f@@ ar more s@@ us@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to TB infec@@ tion, and are less able to fi@@ ght it off@@ .
The Department of Health is in the process of adop@@ ting an integrated TB and HIV/Aids strateg@@ y.
C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently volun@@ tary counselling and testing (@@ V@@ C@@ T) is offered to TB clients with the aim of re@@ duc@@ ing early death and ill@@ n@@ ess.

The decision to be tes@@ ted is a volun@@ tary one - no one can be for@@ ced to have an HIV test@@ .
The three main ste@@ ps to be follow@@ ed are pre@@ -@@ test counsel@@ l@@ ing, testing and post@@ -@@ test counsel@@ l@@ ing.
* Pre@@ -@@ test counselling
* Testing
* Po@@ st@@ -@@ test counselling
P@@ RE@@ -@@ TE@@ S@@ T CO@@ UN@@ SE@@ L@@ LIN@@ G
The disc@@ us@@ sion is private and conf@@ identi@@ al and includes information about HIV/AIDS and the test it@@ self@@ .
Pro@@ x@@ y consent can also be gi@@ ven@@ .
This is when a person is leg@@ ally entitled to give consent on behalf of another individu@@ al.
For example, a parent or guardi@@ an of a child below the age of 14 may give consent for an HIV test for the chil@@ d.
However, children who are 14 years and ol@@ der who have cons@@ ented to a test must be given their test resul@@ ts.
This information may not be given to their parents without their cons@@ ent.
TESTING
HIV testing for an employ@@ ee in the work@@ place is pro@@ hibi@@ ted unless j@@ usti@@ fied by an order of the Labour Cour@@ t, in accordance with the Employ@@ ment E@@ qu@@ ity Act No 55 of 1998 Section 7@@ (@@ 2@@ ).
The HIV test is an accur@@ ate scientific test to s@@ how if a person has been infected with HIV and is usually done on a person@@ 's bloo@@ d.
Mo@@ st testing sites use a R@@ ap@@ id Tes@@ t, which means that the test results are available after about 20 min@@ ut@@ es.
PO@@ ST@@ -@@ TE@@ S@@ T CO@@ UN@@ SE@@ L@@ LIN@@ G
The rap@@ id test results are given during the post@@ -@@ test counselling ses@@ sion.
This ses@@ sion is also conf@@ identi@@ al and it is against the law for any health care work@@ er@@ /@@ counsel@@ l@@ or to give a test result whether it is positive or neg@@ ative to any other person without the per@@ mission of the individual who has had the test@@ .
If the test result is HIV@@ -@@ neg@@ ativ@@ e, the individual will be counsel@@ led on the d@@ ang@@ ers of ris@@ k@@ y sexual be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our and educ@@ ated about saf@@ er se@@ x practices such as using con@@ dom@@ s.
If the individual is HIV@@ -@@ positive they will be counsel@@ led on how to deal with the new@@ s, and will be given information about saf@@ er se@@ x practices and nu@@ tri@@ tion.
La@@ y counsel@@ lor@@ s in the province are train@@ ed by the Aids Training and Information Centre (@@ ATI@@ C@@ C) based in Plum@@ ste@@ ad, Cape Town.

WHAT IS HIV INF@@ EC@@ TION@@ ?
HIV or the human immun@@ o@@ def@@ ici@@ ency vir@@ us, ca@@ uses HIV infec@@ tion.
Once a person becomes infected with this virus he@@ /@@ she is infected for lif@@ e.
In the long term HIV ca@@ uses AIDS (The Ac@@ qui@@ red immun@@ o@@ def@@ ici@@ ency syn@@ dro@@ me@@ ).
AIDS may only develop after many years of being infected with HIV@@ .
The HIV is passed from person to person in body f@@ l@@ uid@@ s.
The most li@@ kel@@ y way to c@@ at@@ ch the virus is through being ex@@ posed to an infected person@@ 's sexual f@@ l@@ uid@@ s during s@@ ex@@ .
One in every six to eight people in South Africa is HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
You do not need to have many sexual part@@ n@@ ers, n@@ or do you need to have se@@ x often to c@@ at@@ ch HIV@@ .
HIV may also be passed by bl@@ ood or from an infected mother to her bab@@ y during pregn@@ anc@@ y, birth or bre@@ ast@@ -@@ fe@@ ed@@ ing.
It is NO@@ T passed by k@@ is@@ s@@ ing, sharing pla@@ tes or for@@ k@@ s, or using the same to@@ il@@ et.
P@@ RE@@ V@@ ENTI@@ ON AND A@@ W@@ AR@@ EN@@ ESS
Prevention and awareness remain@@ s the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of the Department of Health@@ 's appro@@ ach to de@@ aling with HIV/@@ A@@ id@@ s.
This is based on the A@@ B@@ C@@ s - Ab@@ stain@@ , B@@ e mu@@ tu@@ ally f@@ ai@@ th@@ ful@@ , and Con@@ si@@ st@@ ently U@@ se C@@ ond@@ om@@ s:
* Ab@@ st@@ ain from Se@@ x - This is the only guar@@ ante@@ ed protection from HIV infec@@ tion.
* B@@ e mu@@ tu@@ ally f@@ ai@@ th@@ ful - Al@@ ways have se@@ x with the same person@@ .
This person also must not have se@@ x with anyone el@@ se and not have been infected with HIV or other S@@ exually Trans@@ mitted Inf@@ ec@@ tions.
* Con@@ si@@ st@@ ently U@@ se C@@ ond@@ oms - U@@ se them every time you have sexual inter@@ course and use them correc@@ t@@ ly.
THE IM@@ MUN@@ E S@@ Y@@ STE@@ M@@ :
Your body has an immun@@ e system that def@@ ends your body and ke@@ ep@@ s you well@@ .
HIV att@@ ac@@ ks and k@@ ills the "@@ sol@@ di@@ ers@@ " in the immun@@ e system (@@ called C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ ell@@ s@@ ).
W@@ i@@ th@@ out these C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ el@@ ls your body is unable to def@@ end it@@ self from ger@@ m@@ s.
It takes the HIV many years (@@ between 3 and 20@@ ) to dam@@ age all the C@@ D@@ 4 c@@ el@@ ls so it is a long while before there are to@@ o few to def@@ end your bo@@ d@@ y.
There are many years after infec@@ tion when a person can remain well@@ .
STA@@ G@@ ES OF HIV INF@@ EC@@ TION
St@@ age 1@@ : D@@ uring this time the "@@ sol@@ di@@ ers@@ " are still rel@@ ati@@ vely str@@ on@@ g.

St@@ age 4@@ : An HIV infected person with St@@ age 4 illness is at risk of developing opportun@@ is@@ tic infec@@ tions.
These are infec@@ tions, which only happ@@ en in people with very we@@ ak immun@@ e systems (C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t less than 200 c@@ ell@@ s@@ /@@ m@@ m@@ 3@@ ).
Once one of these ill@@ nesses occ@@ ur@@ s, the person is said to have AID@@ S.
M@@ any of the ill@@ nesses that HIV infected people develop are treat@@ ab@@ le, particul@@ arly when diagno@@ sed ear@@ ly.
Some oth@@ ers can be preven@@ ted.
It is very important that HIV infected people go to see their n@@ urse or doctor if they become un@@ well@@ , to get problems treated as soon as pos@@ si@@ ble.

WHAT IS THE P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T PROGR@@ AM@@ ME@@ ?
When a mother go@@ es to the clinic@@ , Mid@@ wi@@ fe Ob@@ ste@@ tric Unit or hospital for her first an@@ ten@@ at@@ al visi@@ t, she is given counselling and is asked if she wan@@ ts to take an HIV test@@ .
The results are conf@@ identi@@ al, which means that only the counsel@@ l@@ or and health@@ care workers loo@@ king after the mother will disc@@ us@@ s the resul@@ ts.
If the mother takes the test and is found to be HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e, she will have the op@@ tion to jo@@ in the P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T programme free of char@@ ge.
As part of the programme she will be given Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine and Z@@ id@@ o@@ v@@ ud@@ in@@ e, anti@@ -@@ HIV medic@@ in@@ e.
The mother must take the Z@@ id@@ o@@ v@@ ud@@ ine from 34 weeks pregn@@ anc@@ y, and will be given Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine when she go@@ es into labour and reports at the hospital or MO@@ U@@ .
These medic@@ ines in sy@@ r@@ up form@@ , will also be given to the bab@@ y within 6-@@ 72 hours of bir@@ th@@ .
I@@ t@@ 's important to note that@@ :
* The medic@@ ation only re@@ duc@@ es the ch@@ ance of pass@@ ing the virus in the mo@@ ther@@ 's body to the bab@@ y during deliver@@ y.
Trans@@ mission during delivery is the most common fac@@ tor@@ , accoun@@ ting for 60@@ -@@ 85@@ % of trans@@ mis@@ sions of the virus from the mother to her bab@@ y.
* B@@ ab@@ ies who get the virus while the mother is pregn@@ ant or as a result of bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding will not be protec@@ ted by the anti@@ retrovir@@ al medic@@ in@@ e.
* The medic@@ ation is only used to try and protect the bab@@ y.
It is not going to c@@ ure the mother of HIV@@ .
Any mother who wis@@ h@@ es to know her HIV status may access HIV testing and treatment through the P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T program at any an@@ ten@@ at@@ al facility throughout the Western Cape.
INF@@ AN@@ T FE@@ ED@@ ING
Coun@@ selling and advice on inf@@ ant fe@@ eding for HIV@@ -@@ positive mo@@ thers is availa@@ ble.
Mo@@ thers are given a cho@@ ice to either exclu@@ si@@ vely bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed for four to six months or exclu@@ si@@ vely form@@ ula fe@@ ed.
Ex@@ c@@ lu@@ sive bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding means that the bab@@ y must only be given bre@@ ast mil@@ k, no te@@ a, no water and no ju@@ ic@@ e.
This re@@ duc@@ es the ch@@ ance of the virus in the bre@@ ast mil@@ k being passed on to the bab@@ y.
Th@@ o@@ se mo@@ thers choo@@ sing to form@@ ula fe@@ ed will get free mil@@ k pow@@ der for six month@@ s.
They will get two t@@ ins of mil@@ k pow@@ der on dis@@ charge after delivery and will also get eight t@@ ins per month at the local bab@@ y clinic@@ .
THE BA@@ B@@ Y@@ 'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
The mother must go regul@@ arly to the post@@ -@@ nat@@ al clinic to have the bab@@ y w@@ eigh@@ ed, to get immunis@@ ations, to be given mil@@ k pow@@ der and to get Co@@ -@@ tri@@ mo@@ x@@ az@@ o@@ le, medic@@ ine to prevent p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ i@@ a.
B@@ ab@@ ies are tes@@ ted for the HIV at 14 weeks when they report for the 3@@ r@@ d immunis@@ ation visi@@ t.
If neg@@ ativ@@ e, the bab@@ y does not need Co@@ -@@ tri@@ mo@@ x@@ az@@ o@@ le any lon@@ ger@@ .
If the bab@@ y tes@@ ts positive then they must continue with Co@@ -@@ tri@@ mo@@ x@@ az@@ o@@ le.
If the bab@@ y is posi@@ tiv@@ e, it will need special care throughout its lif@@ e.
THE MO@@ TH@@ ER@@ 'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
HIV can live for a long time (@@ 3-@@ 10@@ ) years in the body wh@@ il@@ st the mother fe@@ els health@@ y and well@@ .
For this reas@@ on mo@@ thers are encour@@ aged to go to the clinic regul@@ arly to get medic@@ ine for opportun@@ is@@ tic infec@@ tions to ke@@ ep health@@ y for lon@@ ger@@ .
S@@ he is encour@@ aged to use con@@ d@@ oms every time she has se@@ x so that she can protect h@@ ers@@ el@@ f and her part@@ ner from contrac@@ ting the vir@@ us, or from ge@@ tting more of the virus if both part@@ ners are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
The mother will also be given counselling about contrac@@ ep@@ tion op@@ tions for after the bir@@ th@@ .
The health worker will encour@@ age the mother to tel@@ l the fa@@ ther of the bab@@ y that she is HIV positive so that he can also be tes@@ ted.
This can happ@@ en with the aid of the counsel@@ l@@ or or health work@@ er.
It is important for the mother to jo@@ in a group that will support her and give her information on e@@ ating nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ously and how to l@@ ook after h@@ ers@@ el@@ f and the bab@@ y.

The ant@@ i Aids dr@@ ug A@@ Z@@ T (@@ Z@@ id@@ o@@ v@@ ud@@ in@@ e) will be offered to the child if they are b@@ rou@@ ght to the health facility within 72 hours of being s@@ exually abus@@ ed.
The dr@@ ug has N@@ O impact in preven@@ ting HIV trans@@ mission if the child ar@@ riv@@ es at the facility later than 72 hours after the abus@@ e.
Children cover@@ ed by medical aid should get a th@@ re@@ e-@@ day supp@@ ly of A@@ Z@@ T and a prescri@@ ption for the remain@@ ing 25 da@@ ys.

ORG@@ AN@@ I@@ SA@@ TION@@ S COM@@ BA@@ TING CHI@@ L@@ D A@@ BUS@@ E
To try and com@@ b@@ at the un@@ accep@@ tab@@ ly high levels of child abuse in the Western Cape, health services have jo@@ in@@ ed for@@ ces with polic@@ e, community saf@@ et@@ y, social services and N@@ GO@@ s.
Social workers have an ess@@ enti@@ al role to pla@@ y in hel@@ ping the child to he@@ al after the abus@@ e.
The social worker will offer educ@@ ation, information and counsel@@ l@@ ing.
If the social worker be@@ li@@ ev@@ es that the child is at risk of further abuse when dis@@ char@@ ged from a health facility and is in need of ur@@ g@@ ent protec@@ tion, they can issue a Form 4 det@@ en@@ tion order to remo@@ ve the child to a place of saf@@ et@@ y.
Al@@ so@@ , if a child's mental state requi@@ res more speci@@ ali@@ st@@ / psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tric inter@@ ven@@ tions, the child can be referred to the appropriate health facili@@ ty.
THE D@@ U@@ TY TO RE@@ P@@ ORT CHI@@ L@@ D A@@ BUS@@ E
There are two laws which co@@ ver child physi@@ cal@@ /@@ sexual abuse and neg@@ lec@@ t.
Section 15 of the Child Care A@@ mend@@ ment Act says that any person who has any@@ thing to do with car@@ ing for children - for example teach@@ ers, social work@@ ers, and doc@@ tors - and who suspec@@ ts that a child has been abus@@ ed, must report this to the provincial Department of Social Develop@@ ment.
The Prevention of Family Vi@@ ol@@ ence Act No 13@@ 3 of 1993 (@@ Section 4@@ ) says that suspec@@ ted child abuse must be re@@ ported to a police officer or a child wel@@ f@@ are officer or social work@@ er.

It is esti@@ m@@ ated that 150 000 children bor@@ n an@@ nu@@ ally in South Africa are affected by a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant birth def@@ ec@@ t or gene@@ tic dis@@ order by the age of five years.
The National Department of Health foc@@ uses on 10 conditions with the most common conditions be@@ ing:
* al@@ bin@@ is@@ m
* D@@ own@@ s S@@ yn@@ dro@@ me
* F@@ o@@ et@@ al Al@@ cohol S@@ yn@@ dro@@ me (@@ FA@@ S)
* ne@@ ural t@@ ub@@ e def@@ ec@@ ts (@@ sp@@ ina bi@@ f@@ id@@ a@@ ).
The Western Cape also foc@@ uses on these (@@ except for al@@ bin@@ is@@ m, which has a low incid@@ enc@@ e@@ ), with FA@@ S being the high@@ est pri@@ or@@ ity.
The service aims to prevent children from being bor@@ n with these conditions by providing ti@@ mel@@ y and appropriate gene@@ tic counselling to high@@ -@@ risk individu@@ als and/or c@@ ou@@ pl@@ es.
In order to do so@@ , these individu@@ als first have to be identi@@ fi@@ ed.
They can be identified via the existing services at the clinics from where they will be referred to the specialised gene@@ tic services provided via ou@@ tre@@ ach programmes in rural areas and at tertiary centres in Cape Town.

WHAT IS M@@ AL@@ NU@@ TRI@@ TION@@ ?
Mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion is a serious proble@@ m in South Africa and is one of the bi@@ g@@ ges@@ t contribu@@ tors to child@@ hood illness and de@@ ath@@ .
It is esti@@ m@@ ated that about 30@@ % of South African children are st@@ un@@ ted from a lack of ade@@ qu@@ ate nu@@ tri@@ tion in the early years of their li@@ v@@ es.
In@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate food in@@ tak@@ e, illness and psy@@ cho@@ social str@@ ess@@ /@@ tra@@ uma are the most sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant immedi@@ ate ca@@ uses of mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion.
P@@ over@@ ty and lack of resources are basic fac@@ tors that contribu@@ te to mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion.
The IN@@ P tr@@ ies to deal with this si@@ l@@ ent ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c in a number of wa@@ ys.
SU@@ P@@ PL@@ E@@ MENTS FOR CHI@@ LD@@ RE@@ N
At primary health care level children who are examin@@ ed and identified as under@@ n@@ ouris@@ hed (@@ this includes children and ad@@ ults who are HIV positive and with t@@ uber@@ cul@@ o@@ si@@ s) will be given food sup@@ ple@@ ments including for@@ ti@@ fied ma@@ iz@@ e me@@ al and a high@@ -@@ en@@ ergy dr@@ in@@ k.
Sup@@ ple@@ ments are given to identified clients according to crit@@ eri@@ a.
Health workers also provide counsel@@ l@@ ing, information and education about health@@ y di@@ ets and the health@@ i@@ est ways of prepar@@ ing f@@ oo@@ d.
Di@@ e@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans also provide specialised services to the commun@@ ity.
BRE@@ A@@ ST@@ FE@@ ED@@ ING
To help fi@@ ght mal@@ n@@ ouris@@ h@@ ment in early child@@ hood health workers encour@@ age women to bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ ed their children exclu@@ si@@ vely until six months of age and there@@ after to continue bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding in addi@@ tion to the intro@@ duction of appropriate comple@@ mentary f@@ ood@@ s, until the child is two years ol@@ d.
Other fe@@ eding op@@ tions are disc@@ uss@@ ed with mo@@ thers who are HIV posi@@ tiv@@ e.
Vredendal Hospital and Groote Schuur Ma@@ ternity Centre are B@@ ab@@ y Fri@@ end@@ ly Hospitals in the province according to the B@@ ab@@ y f@@ ri@@ end@@ ly Hospital Ini@@ ti@@ ativ@@ e.

Children who lack V@@ it@@ am@@ in A lo@@ se w@@ eigh@@ t, f@@ ail to gro@@ w proper@@ ly and are more li@@ kel@@ y to get infec@@ tions and to die from them@@ .
A lack of V@@ it@@ am@@ in A also dam@@ ages the e@@ ye and is one of the main ca@@ uses of b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness am@@ ong@@ st childr@@ en.
Children with low birth w@@ eigh@@ ts are given V@@ it@@ am@@ in A cap@@ sul@@ es, which boo@@ st the immun@@ e system and help with the child's develop@@ mental gro@@ w@@ th@@ .
Inf@@ ants from 6 -@@ 11@@ months are given a single do@@ se of V@@ it@@ am@@ in A (@@ 100 000 I@@ U@@ ) to prevent se@@ ver@@ e ill@@ n@@ ess.
Children from 12 months to five years old are given a single do@@ se of 200 000 I@@ U at 12 months then a do@@ se of 200 000 I@@ U every six months until five years of age.

WH@@ O CAN GE@@ T A TER@@ MIN@@ ATION@@ ?
Any women (@@ ir@@ respective of age@@ ) can get a legal ab@@ or@@ tion for an un@@ wan@@ ted pregn@@ ancy according to the C@@ ho@@ ice of T@@ ermin@@ ation of P@@ regn@@ ancy Act no 9@@ 2 of 199@@ 6.
Pre@@ - and post@@ - TO@@ P counselling that is not prescri@@ p@@ tive should be provi@@ de@@ d.
Par@@ ental or part@@ n@@ er's consent is not require@@ d.
Women are advis@@ ed to go for saf@@ e, legal ab@@ or@@ tions ra@@ ther than "@@ bac@@ k@@ stre@@ et@@ " ab@@ or@@ tions that are li@@ kel@@ y to end@@ ang@@ er their health and their li@@ v@@ es.
Al@@ so see Con@@ trac@@ ep@@ tion (F@@ am@@ ily Plann@@ ing) for emergency contrac@@ ep@@ tion.
WH@@ ER@@ E CAN Y@@ OU GE@@ T THE SERVIC@@ E?
To get a free ab@@ or@@ tion, the request for a TO@@ P must be made at a primary health care clinic@@ , where the pregn@@ ancy will be confir@@ me@@ d, counselling provi@@ de@@ d, an appointment ma@@ de, and a refer@@ r@@ al letter be given to a facility where the procedure can be per@@ for@@ me@@ d.
No@@ t all health workers are wil@@ ling to be involved in this servic@@ e, but they are oblig@@ ated by law to inform the cli@@ ent of her rights and must ref@@ er the cli@@ ent to a health worker or facility where she can get the servic@@ e.
The service can also be acc@@ ess@@ ed via a General Pr@@ acti@@ tion@@ er (G@@ P) but a consult@@ ation fee will be require@@ d.
M@@ arie St@@ op@@ es Clinics and private hospitals also provide the service for a fe@@ e.
Any gi@@ r@@ l or women can ask for a TO@@ P in the first three months (@@ 12 week@@ s) of pregn@@ anc@@ y.
It is important to act qu@@ ick@@ ly if an un@@ wan@@ ted pregn@@ ancy is suspec@@ ted.
If you are three to five months (@@ 13@@ -@@ 20 week@@ s) pregn@@ an@@ t, a different set of rules apply for TO@@ P@@ .
The doc@@ tor@@ , in this cas@@ e, will car@@ ry out the TO@@ P only if@@ :
* There is a risk to the physical or mental health of the w@@ om@@ an or fo@@ et@@ us
* H@@ av@@ ing the bab@@ y will c@@ ause maj@@ or social or economic problems for the mo@@ th@@ er.
* The w@@ om@@ an is pregn@@ ant from rap@@ e or inc@@ est@@ .
The servic@@ e, ho@@ wever, must still be requ@@ ested at a Primary Health Care C@@ linic@@ .
The following private organisations can also be of assi@@ st@@ anc@@ e:
* Re@@ productive Rights Al@@ li@@ ance (R@@ RA@@ ): tel 011 40@@ 3 2@@ 101@@ , email r@@ r@@ admin@@ @@@ s@@ n@@ .@@ ap@@ c@@ .@@ org or r@@ rac@@ oor@@ d@@ @@@ s@@ n@@ .@@ ap@@ c@@ .org@@ .

HOW CAN Y@@ OU GE@@ T THE SERVIC@@ E?
If you are a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time visi@@ tor to a health facility you will be asked to fill out a form and a fol@@ der will be op@@ en@@ ed.
Bring your ID boo@@ k, your refer@@ r@@ al letter (@@ if relevan@@ t@@ ), any medic@@ ation you are taking and your clinic@@ /@@ hospital car@@ d, if you have previously registered at the facili@@ ty.
You must sign an inform@@ ed consent form gi@@ ving per@@ mission for the TO@@ P to be don@@ e.
Health workers who are un@@ wil@@ ling to give the service for any reas@@ on must ref@@ er you to a col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue who is wil@@ ling to do so or to the appropriate regional facility with a refer@@ r@@ al letter and a boo@@ k@@ ing.

Re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment A@@ ge@@ : What A@@ re Your Righ@@ ts@@ ?
AUTHOR@@ : Cape Gateway
E@@ ven@@ tu@@ al@@ ly, everyone needs to stop work@@ ing.
Some people pre@@ fer to re@@ ti@@ re at an early age while oth@@ ers choo@@ se to work for as long as pos@@ si@@ ble.
Wh@@ ate@@ ver your pre@@ fer@@ ence, you need to know what your rights and op@@ tions ar@@ e.
RE@@ TI@@ RE@@ MENT AG@@ E
The labour legislation does not deal directly with the issue of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age.
However, it does sa@@ y that no one may be un@@ fair@@ ly dis@@ crimin@@ ated against because of their age.
This means that the employer and employ@@ ee must ag@@ ree on a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age.
There are three possible situ@@ ations that you could find y@@ our@@ self in:
* Your employment contract requi@@ res you to re@@ ti@@ re at a certain age.
* You have agre@@ ed with you employer on a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age or there is a company nor@@ m.
* There is no men@@ tion of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment in your contract and there is no agree@@ ment.
If you sign an employment contract that sti@@ p@@ ula@@ tes a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age@@ , then you can leg@@ ally be required to re@@ ti@@ re at that age.
The organisation won@@ 't be required to give you no@@ tic@@ e.
If the re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age is not in the contract but is agre@@ ed or if there is an organis@@ ational nor@@ m, then the employer can give you notice requi@@ ring you to re@@ ti@@ re at that age.
The notice period will be the same as the notice period for termin@@ ation of employment set out in your contract of employ@@ ment.
When would there be de@@ em@@ ed to be an organis@@ ational norm@@ ?
There is a general under@@ standing that the "@@ nor@@ mal@@ " re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age is 55@@ , 60 or 65 but this under@@ standing is to@@ o v@@ ag@@ ue to be us@@ ef@@ ul in specific inst@@ anc@@ es.
In@@ di@@ cations of the organis@@ ation@@ 's nor@@ m can be found in:
* the rules of a compan@@ y's provi@@ d@@ ent or pen@@ sion fund (@@ but this is not defin@@ iti@@ v@@ e)
* company polic@@ y.
If there is no men@@ tion of a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age in your contract and there is no organis@@ ational nor@@ m, then you can continue to work until you are unable to do your job proper@@ ly.
Your employer can only termin@@ ate your contract in accordance with the labour legislation (@@ that is for mis@@ conduc@@ t, operational requirements or in@@ compet@@ enc@@ e) and will have to fol@@ low the procedures set out in your contract and labour law@@ .
The courts have found that it is un@@ fair dis@@ crimin@@ ation for your employer to termin@@ ate your employment services j@@ ust because of your age.
For more information on the law around dis@@ mis@@ sal@@ s, see the Department of Lab@@ our@@ 's guide to the Labour Rel@@ ations Act called "@@ K@@ now Your L@@ RA@@ "@@ .
WHAT I@@ F Y@@ OU C@@ ONT@@ IN@@ U@@ E TO WOR@@ K AF@@ TER THE RE@@ TI@@ RE@@ MENT A@@ GE@@ ?
There is no legal cer@@ tain@@ ty regarding the rights of an employ@@ ee who works be@@ y@@ ond re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age.
It is th@@ us advis@@ able for the employer and employ@@ ee to clear@@ ly defin@@ e the terms of employment after the re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age@@ , for example how long the employ@@ ee will continue to work for and what notice is required to termin@@ ate the employ@@ ment.
WH@@ ER@@ E CAN Y@@ OU GE@@ T AN IN@@ COM@@ E F@@ RO@@ M AF@@ TER RE@@ TI@@ RE@@ MENT@@ ?
Af@@ ter you re@@ ti@@ re you will usually re@@ ly on a pen@@ sion or provi@@ d@@ ent fund for your in@@ com@@ e.
You can either dra@@ w a state pen@@ sion or you can contribu@@ te to a private pen@@ sion fund or provi@@ d@@ ent fun@@ d.
For det@@ ailed information on how private provi@@ d@@ ent fun@@ ds and pen@@ sion fun@@ ds work visit the Black S@@ as@@ h and E@@ T@@ U par@@ al@@ eg@@ al advice website.

* You pay over R@@ 2@@ 50 000 a year in sal@@ aries and w@@ ages to your employees (@@ even if they are not registered for PA@@ Y@@ E with SAR@@ S@@ ).
HOW M@@ UC@@ H DO Y@@ OU NE@@ ED TO PA@@ Y@@ ?
You need to pay 1@@ % of the total amount paid in sal@@ aries to employees (@@ including over@@ time pay@@ men@@ ts, leave pa@@ y, bon@@ us@@ es, c@@ ommis@@ sions and l@@ um@@ p su@@ m pay@@ ments@@ ).
HOW DO Y@@ OU PA@@ Y@@ ?
To pay you must register with SARS and pay the lev@@ y each month@@ .
SARS will supp@@ ly the correc@@ t forms to fill in (S@@ D@@ L 2@@ 01 return form@@ ).
The lev@@ y must be paid to SARS not later than se@@ ven days after the end of every month@@ .
HOW DO Y@@ OU GE@@ T A SK@@ I@@ LL@@ S DEVELOPMENT GR@@ AN@@ T@@ ?
You can get money back from the SETA or the National Skills Fund to use on training and developing your employ@@ e@@ es' sk@@ ill@@ s.

There is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ ted evidence of a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant increase in the number of people who have as@@ thma am@@ ong@@ st all rac@@ es in South Africa.
O@@ ver the p@@ ast 25 years a 25 to 200 times r@@ ise in hospital ad@@ mis@@ sions for as@@ thma has been recor@@ ded in hospitals in Dur@@ ban and So@@ wet@@ o@@ .

However, many more Afric@@ ans who have a positive family histor@@ y of all@@ erg@@ y, develop all@@ ergi@@ c diseases as com@@ par@@ ed to other rac@@ es.
The early ex@@ pos@@ ure to foreign all@@ er@@ gen@@ s from the new@@ ly adopted Western li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le has contribu@@ ted to the higher deg@@ ree or s@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ation recor@@ ded am@@ ong@@ st African inf@@ ants than oth@@ ers.

There are 78@@ 8 World Heritage sites ac@@ ross the glo@@ be which are protec@@ ted in order to cons@@ erve their natural be@@ au@@ ty or cultural and histor@@ ical sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ anc@@ e.
Si@@ tes listed as World Heritage Si@@ tes receive national and international rec@@ ogni@@ tion.
Si@@ x sites in South Africa have been declared World Heritage Si@@ tes by the Uni@@ ted N@@ ations Educ@@ ation@@ al, Sci@@ entific and Cultural Organis@@ ation (@@ Un@@ es@@ co@@ ).
They are:
* The Cape F@@ lor@@ al Reg@@ ion
* Ro@@ b@@ b@@ en Is@@ land
* The Gre@@ ater St L@@ u@@ ci@@ a Wet@@ land
* u@@ Kha@@ h@@ lam@@ b@@ a - Drak@@ ens@@ berg

THE CAPE F@@ L@@ OR@@ AL REGI@@ ON (200@@ 4@@ )
The f@@ yn@@ bos reg@@ ion of the Western and E@@ astern Cape has rec@@ ently been recogn@@ ised as a World Heritage site because of its natural be@@ au@@ ty and scientific import@@ anc@@ e.
In tot@@ al, the site covers 55@@ 3@@ ,@@ 000 h@@ ec@@ tar@@ es of land that are particul@@ arly ric@@ h in plant speci@@ es, repres@@ enting near@@ ly 20@@ % of Africa@@ 's f@@ lor@@ a.
The uni@@ qu@@ e f@@ lor@@ a of the reg@@ ion is of particular value to sci@@ ence as there is a hu@@ ge diversity and d@@ ensi@@ ty of F@@ yn@@ bos speci@@ es within a rel@@ ati@@ vely small area.
The speci@@ es d@@ ensi@@ ty in the Cape F@@ lor@@ al Reg@@ ion is also am@@ ong@@ st the high@@ est in the world and it has been identified as one of the wor@@ l@@ d@@ 's 18 bio@@ diversity ho@@ t spo@@ ts.
RO@@ B@@ BE@@ N IS@@ LAND (@@ 199@@ 9@@ )
The histor@@ ical sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of Ro@@ b@@ b@@ en Is@@ land led to its rec@@ ogni@@ tion as a World heritage site in 199@@ 9.
Ro@@ b@@ b@@ en Is@@ land has been used over the last five c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies as a pris@@ on, a hospital and a mi@@ li@@ tary b@@ as@@ e.

The geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c diversity of the wet@@ lands and their inter@@ action with cli@@ mati@@ c ele@@ ments has resul@@ ted in exc@@ ep@@ tional speci@@ es di@@ versi@@ ty.
The mo@@ s@@ ai@@ c of land@@ forms and hab@@ it@@ at types also create bre@@ ath@@ taking sc@@ en@@ ic vis@@ t@@ as@@ .
The St@@ . L@@ u@@ ci@@ a site consists of thir@@ teen protec@@ ted areas with a total size of 2@@ 34@@ ,@@ 5@@ 66 h@@ ec@@ tar@@ es.
The site is the lar@@ ges@@ t es@@ tu@@ ar@@ ine system in Africa and includes the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n@@ most exten@@ sion of cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s on the contin@@ ent.
Some of the natural ph@@ eno@@ men@@ a of the wet@@ lands are: the lar@@ ge numbers of n@@ esting tur@@ t@@ les on the be@@ ach@@ es, the migr@@ ation of wh@@ al@@ es, do@@ l@@ ph@@ ins and wh@@ al@@ e-@@ shar@@ ks off@@ -@@ sh@@ ore and en@@ or@@ m@@ ous numbers of water@@ fo@@ w@@ l.

Health in Ac@@ tion@@ : Po@@ is@@ on@@ ing
Children are natural ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers and are very li@@ kel@@ y to experi@@ ment.
It is not sur@@ pris@@ ing that over 60 per@@ cent of cases of accid@@ ental po@@ is@@ on@@ ion@@ g invol@@ ve children under five years.
WHAT ARE THE MA@@ IN C@@ A@@ US@@ ES OF PO@@ IS@@ ON@@ ING@@ ?
The majority of accid@@ ental po@@ is@@ on@@ ings invol@@ ve medic@@ ines and dr@@ ug@@ s that have been le@@ f@@ t in pla@@ ces that the child can re@@ ach@@ .
Children often also try dr@@ in@@ king hou@@ se@@ hold products such as par@@ aff@@ in and clean@@ ing f@@ l@@ uid@@ s, especially if these have been p@@ ou@@ red into bo@@ tt@@ les or contain@@ ers that usually cont@@ ain dr@@ in@@ ks or f@@ oo@@ d.
Ch@@ ron@@ ic po@@ is@@ on@@ ing, such as le@@ ad po@@ is@@ on@@ ing, may some@@ times occ@@ ur in children living in po@@ l@@ lu@@ ted conditions ne@@ ar indus@@ trial or chemical plan@@ ts.
CAN PO@@ IS@@ ON@@ ING B@@ E P@@ RE@@ V@@ EN@@ TE@@ D AND WHAT CAN I DO@@ ?
Pre@@ ven@@ tion@@ :
* M@@ ake sure that medic@@ in@@ es, dr@@ ug@@ s, coo@@ king agents and clean@@ ing products are k@@ ept out of re@@ ach of childr@@ en, in loc@@ ked c@@ up@@ bo@@ ard@@ s.
* U@@ se contain@@ ers with safety s@@ cre@@ w t@@ op@@ s for these produc@@ ts.
* S@@ tore them in contain@@ ers that will not be mis@@ taken for col@@ d dr@@ ink or s@@ weet bo@@ tt@@ l@@ es.
* N@@ ever st@@ ore food and clean@@ ing products or food and medic@@ ines toge@@ th@@ er.
* Ad@@ ults should a@@ vo@@ id taking medic@@ ation in f@@ ron@@ t of childr@@ en, as children are gre@@ at im@@ it@@ ator@@ s.
* A@@ vo@@ id st@@ oring po@@ is@@ on@@ ous substan@@ ces in un@@ la@@ bel@@ led bo@@ tt@@ l@@ es.
* K@@ e@@ ep in@@ sec@@ t and we@@ ed k@@ ill@@ ers saf@@ ely out of the si@@ ght and re@@ ach of childr@@ en.
In indus@@ trial areas it is important that the environment is monit@@ or@@ ed to ensure that chemicals do not re@@ ach un@@ accep@@ tab@@ ly high and dan@@ ger@@ ous level@@ s.
The Ri@@ ght Res@@ pon@@ ses To Su@@ spec@@ ted Po@@ is@@ on@@ ing:
* Find the sub@@ stance or the contain@@ er of the sub@@ stance that you suspec@@ t the child has sw@@ allow@@ ed or t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed.
S@@ ave this to take with you to the clinic or hospit@@ al.
* If the child is cons@@ ci@@ ous and there are sign@@ s that he or she has sw@@ allow@@ ed po@@ is@@ on, you may try and get the child to v@@ om@@ it.
* If the child has sw@@ allow@@ ed a det@@ erg@@ ent or cor@@ ro@@ sive aci@@ d, do not give him or her any@@ thing to dr@@ in@@ k, because the dr@@ ink mi@@ ght re@@ act with the po@@ ison and do more dam@@ age in@@ side the chil@@ d.
* If the child has t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed a sub@@ stance that can c@@ ause po@@ is@@ on@@ ing si@@ mp@@ ly by sk@@ in contac@@ t, remo@@ ve clo@@ thing that mi@@ ght be affected and was@@ h the sk@@ in, ha@@ i@@ r and na@@ il@@ s - first with pla@@ in water and then using so@@ ap@@ .
Fin@@ ally r@@ in@@ se the sk@@ in thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly and d@@ ry@@ .
* If the child has a po@@ is@@ on@@ ous sub@@ stance in the e@@ y@@ e, was@@ h the e@@ ye gen@@ tly with lu@@ ke@@ war@@ m water for up to ten min@@ ut@@ es.
* K@@ e@@ ep the child com@@ for@@ table and take him or her to the nearest health facili@@ ty.
Do No@@ t En@@ cour@@ age V@@ om@@ it@@ ing I@@ f@@ :
* The po@@ ison is of the type that would c@@ ause bur@@ ning in the th@@ ro@@ at and di@@ ges@@ tive system (for inst@@ ance, bat@@ ter@@ y aci@@ d, clean@@ ing products that cont@@ ain ca@@ us@@ tic so@@ da@@ )
* The child has sw@@ allow@@ ed par@@ aff@@ in because o@@ ily dro@@ pl@@ ets may c@@ ause problems in the l@@ un@@ gs and result in p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia

In record time we have b@@ rou@@ ght it to Par@@ lia@@ ment.
I want to pay tribu@@ te to the dr@@ af@@ ters who have stu@@ di@@ ed and assess@@ ed si@@ mi@@ lar acts nation@@ ally and developed a wor@@ th@@ y product for our Provin@@ ce.
It is important to note that we are able to establish this Commission in this year not only because of the political will that we have de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate@@ d, but also through sav@@ ings effec@@ ted on Government programm@@ es, th@@ us providing the resources we ne@@ ed.
This Province has ne@@ ver bud@@ ge@@ ted for a Youth Commission be@@ for@@ e.
The Bill is one of the Deposi@@ ts in the first 100 da@@ ys.
B@@ ut it has a long term view and must be part of the change this Government is driving to@@ ward relevan@@ ce, inclu@@ sion and sustain@@ abili@@ ty.
The Bill will be ga@@ z@@ et@@ ted t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w@@ .
Th@@ en the process beg@@ ins of public particip@@ ation, disc@@ us@@ sion in the Stand@@ ing Committee on Govern@@ ance under C@@ ha@@ ir@@ person Pa@@ tric@@ k Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie and ulti@@ m@@ ately the adoption by Parliament for my enac@@ t@@ ment.
Cabinet has done its work for no@@ w@@ .
It is now over to you.
I call on the youth of our Province to support the process and to inf@@ lu@@ ence the fin@@ al Act in ways that will serve your needs bes@@ t.
You must own it in every way as your own t@@ ool to build our Home for Al@@ l.
S@@ cr@@ ut@@ in@@ ise the B@@ ill@@ .
Dis@@ c@@ us@@ s it.
De@@ b@@ ate it.
The pro@@ posed Youth C@@ ommission@@ 's role will be to help Government plan and then to monitor and evalu@@ ate the programmes of Government in terms of out@@ comes as they affec@@ t the you@@ th@@ .
They will also be responsible for promo@@ ting youth un@@ ity and pa@@ tri@@ o@@ ti@@ s@@ m and to serve as the con@@ nec@@ tion with N@@ ation@@ al, other Provincial and Local Government youth struc@@ tur@@ es.
This Bill is an important adv@@ ance on the National Youth Commission Act which has a soci@@ o-@@ political focus in the con@@ text of n@@ ation buil@@ d@@ ing.
The Western Cape Youth Commission buil@@ ds on this f@@ oundation to provide exp@@ li@@ ci@@ t youth participation in soci@@ o-@@ economic development with a focus on economic re@@ al@@ ties and necessary sk@@ ill@@ s.
These young lea@@ ders must be fit and commit@@ ted represent@@ atives of our Provin@@ ce.
They must also de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate the gen@@ der, rac@@ e, relig@@ ious and cultural di@@ versi@@ ties of our Province in their com@@ position and work.
The role of the Provin@@ ce@@ 's Youth Des@@ k will have to change to@@ o in support of this new structure and its important work.
This will be a subject for disc@@ us@@ sion for the new Commission and Govern@@ ment.
The Provincial Youth Commission was not and may not be a f@@ las@@ h in the pan@@ .
In prepar@@ ing for last year@@ 's Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit it was c@@ le@@ ar that we nee@@ ded to under@@ stand the need for youth em@@ power@@ ment, h@@ ence the Youth Economic Development S@@ um@@ mit before the G@@ D@@ S and sub@@ sequ@@ ent disc@@ us@@ sions with youth structures towards sec@@ uring a place for our youth to be he@@ ard and sup@@ por@@ ted.

We are going to support them to:
* S@@ ay no to dr@@ ug@@ s

To put it posi@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, youth development in all its fac@@ ets is on the ag@@ end@@ a for this Govern@@ ment.
You have a v@@ ital and fun@@ da@@ mental role to pla@@ y in building this Home for Al@@ l.

U@@ s@@ as@@ az@@ o in isi@@ Xhosa means "@@ disp@@ ers@@ al@@ " or "@@ sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing@@ "@@ .

For near@@ ly 10 years no@@ w@@ , this school community has been in search of a permanent hom@@ e.

The contrac@@ tors completed the building work in August 200@@ 4.
The cost of the project was R@@ 10@@ ,@@ 7 milli@@ on.
This must be bal@@ anc@@ ed against the f@@ act that in rec@@ ent year@@ s, the Department sp@@ ent up to R@@ 3.@@ 4 million a year to transport learners from Khayelitsha to available premis@@ es in Ma@@ it@@ land@@ .

When sport fix@@ tures are set between disadvantaged schools which are loc@@ ated f@@ ar a@@ way from each oth@@ er, many schools si@@ mp@@ ly choo@@ se not to com@@ pe@@ te due to transport proble@@ m@@ s.
As a resul@@ t, young sports pla@@ y@@ ers suff@@ er a lack of competi@@ tion.
"@@ C@@ l@@ us@@ ter sport le@@ ag@@ u@@ es@@ " have therefore been pil@@ o@@ ted in four disadvantaged areas to bring schools in the same area toge@@ th@@ er, so that appropriate fix@@ tures can be set up between c@@ l@@ us@@ ter school@@ s, to re@@ vi@@ ve inter@@ -@@ school competi@@ tion.
F@@ acili@@ ties, equip@@ ment, training and co@@ ach@@ ing are also shar@@ ed among schools in the c@@ l@@ us@@ ter syste@@ m.
The c@@ l@@ us@@ ter le@@ ag@@ ue system has been pil@@ o@@ ted at Han@@ over Park, Bonteheu@@ wel@@ , Gug@@ ule@@ th@@ u, Ny@@ anga and Ph@@ illi@@ p@@ pi@@ , where rug@@ by@@ , net@@ b@@ all, so@@ cc@@ er and ch@@ ess are success@@ fully being pla@@ y@@ ed in the le@@ ag@@ ue syste@@ m.
The current win@@ ter c@@ l@@ us@@ ter sport le@@ ag@@ ue fix@@ tures are sch@@ ed@@ u@@ led to fin@@ is@@ h by the end of September so as not to inter@@ rup@@ t school exam@@ s.
Sports equipment wor@@ th more than R@@ 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 was also han@@ ded over to c@@ l@@ us@@ ter schools by Minister St@@ al@@ i in July 200@@ 4.
The equipment was han@@ ded over to c@@ l@@ us@@ ter committees ra@@ ther than individual schools to ensure more children have use of the equip@@ ment.
The sports equipment inclu@@ ded b@@ ask@@ et b@@ all@@ s, c@@ ric@@ k@@ et b@@ ats and b@@ all@@ s, volle@@ y b@@ all@@ s, ho@@ c@@ key k@@ it, so@@ cc@@ er and rug@@ by b@@ all@@ s, training bi@@ b@@ s, ch@@ ess s@@ et@@ s, and table ten@@ n@@ is equip@@ ment.

W@@ i@@ th@@ out a pla@@ ying fiel@@ d, schools cannot offer many out@@ do@@ or spor@@ ts.
S@@ even disadvantaged schools were therefore given R@@ 18@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 each in August 2004 for the up@@ gr@@ ading of pla@@ ying fi@@ eld@@ s, including the costs of land@@ s@@ cap@@ ing, la@@ ying of gr@@ as@@ s and bor@@ e@@ ho@@ le ir@@ rig@@ ation.
The schools were sel@@ ected on the basis of need - some currently have no pla@@ ying fiel@@ ds at all@@ .
The project is a part@@ nership between the Department of Cultural Af@@ fair@@ s, Sport and Rec@@ re@@ ation, the Saf@@ er Schools Pro@@ jec@@ t, the Department of Community Safety and the M@@ ulti@@ -@@ Agency De@@ li@@ very Ac@@ tion M@@ echan@@ is@@ m (@@ MA@@ DA@@ M@@ ), which br@@ ings different ag@@ en@@ cies together in com@@ b@@ ating cri@@ me.

The Dis@@ pu@@ te Res@@ ol@@ ution In@@ d@@ aba was held in July 200@@ 4.
As many as 1@@ 70 delegates from 40 Western Cape sports fe@@ der@@ ations particip@@ ate@@ d.
The In@@ d@@ aba was con@@ ven@@ ed to find ways of l@@ ess@@ ening the administration bur@@ den on courts of sports disp@@ u@@ tes and impro@@ ving capacity in sport fe@@ der@@ ations.

The In@@ d@@ aba led to the laun@@ ch of The Western Cape Dis@@ pu@@ te Res@@ ol@@ ution For@@ um@@ .
The Forum should be func@@ tional by April 200@@ 5, once the appropriate legislation has been pass@@ ed.
The Department of Cultural Af@@ fair@@ s, Sport and Recreation is currently consi@@ dering nomin@@ ations for members of the For@@ um@@ .
A trans@@ formation and disp@@ ute unit within the Department will provide administrative support to the Dis@@ pu@@ te Res@@ ol@@ ution For@@ um@@ .
The sum@@ mit was atten@@ ded by so@@ cc@@ er administr@@ ators from various bo@@ di@@ es, including offici@@ als from the South African F@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all Associ@@ ation (SA@@ FA@@ ) Provincial and National Ex@@ ecu@@ tiv@@ e.
D@@ el@@ eg@@ ates adopted a strategy to remo@@ ve the st@@ um@@ b@@ ling b@@ loc@@ ks that ret@@ ard the development and growth of so@@ cc@@ er.
This strategy inclu@@ ded commit@@ ments to:
* Str@@ eng@@ then and for@@ ma@@ li@@ se rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps between SA@@ FA@@ , the Uni@@ ted Schools Sports Associ@@ ation of South Africa (@@ US@@ SA@@ SA@@ ) and the South African Stu@@ d@@ ents Sports Uni@@ on (SA@@ S@@ SU@@ ).

G@@ ain@@ ing access to fin@@ ance is one of the most diffic@@ ult problems experi@@ enc@@ ed by small busin@@ ess@@ es.
Financial institutions have str@@ ing@@ ent requirements for lo@@ an@@ s, often requi@@ ring sec@@ ur@@ ity, such as fix@@ ed proper@@ ty.
Y@@ et entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs often have few resources and no@@ thing to offer as security for a lo@@ an@@ .
L@@ ac@@ k of fin@@ anc@@ ing is a maj@@ or fac@@ tor b@@ loc@@ king the emer@@ gen@@ ce of new sm@@ all, medi@@ um and mic@@ r@@ o enterpris@@ es (S@@ M@@ ME@@ s@@ ).
Minister L@@ yn@@ ne Bro@@ wn ra@@ ised R@@ 35 million in total for the Red Finance Fund during the 100 da@@ ys.
A pr@@ er@@ equi@@ site for a lo@@ an from RED Finance will be that the benef@@ ici@@ aries participate in a com@@ prehensive men@@ tor@@ ing and skills development programme ta@@ il@@ or@@ ed for new enterpris@@ es and entreprene@@ ur@@ s.
This will help the enterpris@@ es which are fin@@ anc@@ ed to be sustainable - and therefore also be able to re@@ pay their lo@@ an@@ s.
The Department will also eng@@ age in a vig@@ or@@ ous c@@ ampaign to encour@@ age financial institutions to change their standards so that more SM@@ ME@@ s may access con@@ ven@@ tional lo@@ an@@ s.

Ex@@ per@@ ts esti@@ mate that around se@@ ven out of every tw@@ el@@ ve new South African businesses don@@ 't succ@@ e@@ ed.
Whi@@ le some of this can be at@@ tribu@@ ted to in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate fin@@ anc@@ ing, a key fac@@ tor could also be a lack of men@@ tor@@ ing and sup@@ por@@ t.
To address this proble@@ m, the represent@@ atives of the Western Cape@@ 's four social part@@ n@@ ers, Commun@@ ity, Lab@@ our@@ , Business and Govern@@ ment, resol@@ ved at the Provincial Gro@@ wth and Development S@@ um@@ mit held in November 200@@ 3, to laun@@ ch a trial programme to help 100 existing small medi@@ um and mic@@ r@@ o enterpris@@ es to succ@@ eed through inten@@ sive men@@ tor@@ ing and support - called "@@ inc@@ ub@@ ation@@ "@@ .
This pil@@ ot project was laun@@ ch@@ ed on 11 August 2004 by the Minister of Fin@@ ance, Economic Development and Tourism, L@@ yn@@ ne Bro@@ wn@@ .
The Department will sp@@ end R1,@@ 2 million on men@@ tor@@ ing and supporting these busin@@ ess@@ es.
Each enter@@ prise will be given a business ment@@ or for an un@@ specified l@@ eng@@ th of time.
The National Pro@@ duc@@ tiv@@ ity Institute (N@@ P@@ I@@ ) is also being appointed to under@@ take a diagno@@ sis of each enterpris@@ e.
The N@@ P@@ I will then comp@@ ile a report with a recommend@@ ation for each individual busin@@ ess, as well as identi@@ f@@ ying common ne@@ ed@@ s.
This process will take appro@@ xim@@ ately two month@@ s.
The Department will then issue ten@@ ders to service provi@@ ders who may be able to serve these common ne@@ ed@@ s.

Traffic Fin@@ es: F@@ requ@@ ently A@@ sk@@ ed Qu@@ es@@ tions
Each municipality hand@@ les traffic fin@@ es in its juris@@ dic@@ tion.
It is your right to view spe@@ ed@@ -@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a photo@@ s and cont@@ est in writing any traffic fine you may recei@@ v@@ e.
1. What are the different kin@@ ds of traffic fin@@ es@@ ?
2. How long do I have to pay a traffic fin@@ e?
3. How do I cont@@ est a fin@@ e?
4. What happ@@ ens if I don@@ 't pay or cont@@ est my traffic fin@@ e?
5. Where and how can I pay my traffic fin@@ e?
WHAT ARE THE DI@@ FF@@ ER@@ EN@@ T K@@ IND@@ S OF TRAFFIC F@@ IN@@ ES@@ ?
You can get one of two kin@@ ds of fin@@ es, regar@@ d@@ less of the traffic viol@@ ation:
1. A Section 5@@ 6 notice or In@@ st@@ ant S@@ um@@ m@@ ons is given to you by a traffic offic@@ er, usually for a mo@@ ving viol@@ ation.
It has a court date on it.
2. A Section 34@@ 1 notice is sent to a motor@@ is@@ t by post for viol@@ ations c@@ au@@ ght on traffic c@@ am@@ er@@ a or for traffic tic@@ k@@ ets issued in ab@@ s@@ ence of the motor@@ is@@ ts (for example, for an expi@@ red licence di@@ sk@@ ).
It does not have a court date on it but is a first notice before sum@@ mon@@ s.
The Traffic Department will issue a second notice before sum@@ m@@ ons before ac@@ tu@@ ally issuing the sum@@ mon@@ s.
HOW L@@ ON@@ G DO I HA@@ VE TO PA@@ Y A TRAFFIC F@@ IN@@ E?
A Section 5@@ 6 notice serv@@ es as an In@@ st@@ ant S@@ um@@ mon@@ s, which means you have about 30 days to pay before your case go@@ es to cour@@ t.
A Section 34@@ 1 notice is a notice before sum@@ mon@@ s, not a sum@@ m@@ ons it@@ self@@ .
You usually get two noti@@ ces before the sum@@ m@@ ons is issu@@ ed, after which you have about another 30 days to pay (@@ or cont@@ est your fine in writ@@ ing) before your case go@@ es to cour@@ t.
In tot@@ al, you have appro@@ xim@@ ately three months to pay a Section 34@@ 1 tic@@ k@@ et.
Please note that the ex@@ act l@@ eng@@ th of time you have to pay a tic@@ k@@ et v@@ aries from municipality to municipali@@ ty.
Ch@@ eck your tic@@ k@@ et for the payment due d@@ ate.
HOW DO I CON@@ TE@@ S@@ T A F@@ IN@@ E?
You can cont@@ est your traffic fine in writing with the municipal traffic department any time before a sum@@ m@@ ons has been is issu@@ ed.
R@@ em@@ ember to send a copy of your traffic fine al@@ ong with your let@@ ter.
The traffic department will respon@@ d to your chall@@ en@@ ge in writ@@ ing.
If you are not s@@ ati@@ s@@ fied with the out@@ com@@ e, you can w@@ ai@@ t for your sum@@ m@@ ons and send your chall@@ en@@ ge, in writ@@ ing, to the traffic department again@@ .
The traffic department will then present this letter to the Pro@@ secu@@ tor on your behal@@ f.
The Pro@@ secu@@ tor then deci@@ des whether to prosecu@@ te, in which in@@ stance the case will go in f@@ ron@@ t of a mag@@ istr@@ ate, or to dro@@ p the cas@@ e.
Please note that writing a letter will not del@@ ay the proc@@ ess.
If you do not re@@ ach an agreement by the court d@@ ate, the case will appe@@ ar in cour@@ t.
WHAT H@@ AP@@ P@@ EN@@ S I@@ F I D@@ ON@@ '@@ T PA@@ Y OR CON@@ TE@@ S@@ T MY TRAFFIC F@@ IN@@ E?
If you don@@ 't pay or cont@@ est your traffic fine by the due date and do not appe@@ ar in court to present your cas@@ e, a war@@ ran@@ t for your ar@@ rest will automati@@ cally be issued when the case go@@ es to cour@@ t.
WH@@ ER@@ E AND HOW CAN I PA@@ Y MY TRAFFIC F@@ IN@@ E?
All municipalities acc@@ ept ch@@ equ@@ es and postal orders by post@@ .
For saf@@ et@@ y's sak@@ e, cas@@ h should be paid in person@@ .
Some municipalities acc@@ ept online bank trans@@ f@@ ers or have an online facility to view photo@@ s and make pay@@ ments.

10 Re@@ as@@ ons for Sup@@ porting Immunis@@ ation
1. Poli@@ o and meas@@ les are high@@ ly infec@@ ti@@ ous diseases that are lif@@ e-@@ th@@ reat@@ ening and often result in l@@ ong@@ -@@ term dam@@ age and dis@@ abili@@ ty.
2. Immunis@@ ation is a high@@ ly effec@@ tiv@@ e, af@@ for@@ d@@ able way to com@@ b@@ at these diseases and protect all our childr@@ en.
3. Immunis@@ ation is also very saf@@ e.
The risk of an all@@ ergi@@ c re@@ action is very much sm@@ all@@ er than for most other medic@@ in@@ es.
It har@@ d@@ ly ever occ@@ ur@@ s.
4. Mas@@ s c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s p@@ ic@@ k up the children that have mis@@ sed some of their visi@@ ts to the clinic for immunis@@ ation.
In this way more children are protec@@ ted.
5. You cannot over immun@@ ise a chil@@ d.
E@@ ven fully immun@@ ised children get ex@@ tr@@ a benefit form mass immunis@@ ation c@@ ampai@@ gn@@ s.
6. The th@@ re@@ at of poli@@ o and meas@@ les remain@@ s a re@@ al on@@ e.
Al@@ th@@ ough South Africa has not experi@@ enc@@ ed poli@@ o for year@@ s, it is still a proble@@ m in many countries and could be im@@ ported by a visi@@ tor.
7. M@@ any of our children are HIV@@ -@@ positive and they are especially vul@@ ner@@ able to infec@@ ti@@ ous diseas@@ es.
It is ex@@ tr@@ a important to immun@@ ise them@@ .
8. Immunis@@ ation is a social responsibi@@ li@@ ty.
We can only create a meas@@ les@@ - and poli@@ o-@@ free environment if all children are immunis@@ ed.
9. M@@ any countries are comple@@ te@@ ly poli@@ o-@@ fre@@ e.
South Africa is close to being recogn@@ ised as poli@@ o-@@ free by the World Health organis@@ ation.
An out@@ bre@@ ak would r@@ u@@ in years of h@@ ard work towards th@@ is.
10@@ . It is possible to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate diseases glo@@ bal@@ ly.
Immunis@@ ation en@@ abled us to tri@@ um@@ p@@ h over sm@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ .
A poli@@ o-@@ free world is a very re@@ al pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ty.

WHAT IS M@@ AR@@ KE@@ T@@ ING@@ ?
Marketing is the process businesses use to create and increase the number of products so@@ ld in the mark@@ et@@ place to a specific group of people that a business would tar@@ ge@@ t.
Wit@@ h mark@@ et@@ ing, you use knowledge of the environment and act on it in a particular wa@@ y.
An official defin@@ i@@ tion you may lear@@ n at an M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss descri@@ b@@ es marketing as@@ : "@@ the process of planning and execu@@ ting the conc@@ ep@@ tion, p@@ ric@@ ing, promo@@ tion, and distribu@@ tion of ide@@ as@@ , g@@ ood@@ s, and services to create ex@@ changes that s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy individual and organ@@ iz@@ ational go@@ al@@ s@@ .@@ " - D@@ ic@@ tion@@ ary of Marketing Ter@@ ms
Any business needs sal@@ es to be able to su@@ st@@ ain the busin@@ ess.
Mon@@ ey made from sal@@ es needs to co@@ ver staff sal@@ aries and many other costs required to r@@ un your busin@@ ess.
Al@@ so@@ , marketing pres@@ ents the outside fac@@ e of your organisation and it is important to make a good im@@ pres@@ sion in the mark@@ et@@ pla@@ ce.
This mak@@ es your tar@@ get market group fe@@ el positive about your busin@@ ess, which is your own brand@@ .
The tar@@ get market is the specific group of people you are ai@@ ming your produc@@ t.
F@@ OU@@ R MA@@ J@@ OR A@@ SP@@ EC@@ TS OF M@@ AR@@ KE@@ TING
There are four maj@@ or fac@@ tors in any good marketing plan@@ :
1. Pro@@ duc@@ t - (@@ the ite@@ m, or service you present to the mark@@ et@@ )
2. P@@ ric@@ e - (@@ the amount you charge for the produc@@ t, service or ite@@ m)
3. Pla@@ ce - (@@ how and where you distribu@@ te the produc@@ t)
4. Promo@@ tion - (@@ how you communic@@ ate with the mark@@ et@@ place to let them know about your produc@@ t)
These four are also called the Marketing M@@ i@@ x or the 4@@ P@@ s.
1. Pro@@ duc@@ t:
If you know what it is that your tar@@ get market needs and have the right product to mat@@ ch that@@ , this means you have ful@@ fil@@ led the first require@@ ment, nam@@ ely Pro@@ duc@@ t.
Your product f@@ ills a market ga@@ p that is not being addres@@ s@@ ed.
To get this righ@@ t, it is important to know your tar@@ get mark@@ et, and what they want and ne@@ ed.
The sa@@ y@@ ing: "@@ the custom@@ er is al@@ ways righ@@ t@@ " has lo@@ ts of tr@@ u@@ th to it, where they the custom@@ er will t@@ alk either with their w@@ all@@ ets or public@@ ly about your produc@@ t.
It is therefore important to li@@ ste@@ n to them and act respon@@ si@@ bly as a mar@@ ke@@ ter to take their chan@@ ging needs into accoun@@ t.
2. P@@ ric@@ e:
This is the second P of basic mark@@ et@@ ing.
The ques@@ tion to ask y@@ our@@ self is whether you have made sure that you have the best p@@ ric@@ e for your produc@@ t@@ ?
If you charge to@@ o much for your produc@@ t, the tar@@ get market group will not be able to bu@@ y it.
They may not be able to af@@ ford it, or the value of your product in their min@@ ds does not mat@@ ch that p@@ ric@@ e, so they will not pay for it.
If you charge to@@ o li@@ tt@@ le, the tar@@ get market may th@@ ink there is s@@ om@@ eth@@ ing f@@ ake or ch@@ e@@ a@@ p and they may not want to associ@@ ate with such p@@ ric@@ ing.
Al@@ so@@ , it is v@@ ital to know what your competi@@ tors are char@@ g@@ ing.
Your competi@@ tor may have their p@@ ric@@ es w@@ ron@@ g, and per@@ h@@ ap@@ s you can provide a better product at a better p@@ ric@@ e@@ !
It is a mi@@ x of gu@@ t-@@ fe@@ el and sci@@ ence.
3. Pla@@ c@@ e:
This is the third P which conc@@ entr@@ ates on how you get your product to your custom@@ ers@@ ; from development to the st@@ age where it is 100@@ % ready for pur@@ ch@@ as@@ e.
De@@ pen@@ ding on your produc@@ t, you will have different ne@@ ed@@ s.
For example, fr@@ uit gro@@ w@@ ers will need a te@@ am of air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioned tr@@ uc@@ ks to get produce to the correc@@ t si@@ t@@ es.
The other a@@ spec@@ t of this is that you need to ensure that your product is being so@@ ld in the correc@@ t pla@@ ces.
If you have them on the w@@ r@@ ong si@@ t@@ es, then you will not be re@@ ach@@ ing your main tar@@ get mark@@ et.
4. Promo@@ tion@@ :
This is the metho@@ d you use to per@@ su@@ ade your tar@@ get market to bu@@ y your produc@@ t.
There are various metho@@ ds to do th@@ is, the most well kno@@ wn a@@ spec@@ t of promotion is adver@@ ti@@ s@@ ing.
This is when you em@@ plo@@ y an adver@@ ti@@ sing ag@@ ency to design ads for your product and put them in the pap@@ ers or if you have lo@@ ads of adver@@ ti@@ sing bud@@ ge@@ t, on T@@ V@@ .
Ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing is also called "@@ abo@@ v@@ e-@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ e@@ " mark@@ et@@ ing.
Other effective types of promotion are:
* Sal@@ es promotion - "@@ marketing activities that sti@@ m@@ ula@@ te consum@@ er pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing and de@@ al@@ er effecti@@ ven@@ ess through a com@@ bin@@ ation of personal sel@@ l@@ ing, adver@@ ti@@ s@@ ing, and all sup@@ ple@@ mentary selling activi@@ ti@@ es@@ " from
Ex@@ am@@ ples of sal@@ es promotion are: In@@ -@@ st@@ ore ban@@ n@@ ers, promo@@ tional and corpor@@ ate gi@@ f@@ ting and using a fam@@ ous sport@@ sp@@ ers@@ on to promote product at a mall promotion even@@ t.
This also used to be called "@@ bel@@ ow@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ e@@ "@@ .
To@@ day many ad ag@@ en@@ cies spe@@ ak of them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, as "@@ through@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ e@@ " providing clients with all a@@ spec@@ ts of promo@@ tion, while oth@@ ers are "@@ n@@ ic@@ he@@ "@@ ; providing very specific services to cli@@ en@@ ts.
* Public Rel@@ ations (@@ PR@@ ) - the process of making a special ef@@ for@@ t to communic@@ ate with your tar@@ get market group through arti@@ c@@ les in the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er about your product and through special even@@ ts, which will ra@@ ise the awareness of your product and make positive associ@@ ations with your produc@@ t.
As a cli@@ ent, you will hi@@ re a P@@ R ag@@ ency to al@@ ways be on the loo@@ k@@ out for P@@ R opportunities for the product of the cli@@ ent.
All these forms of promotion cost your business mon@@ e@@ y, so you need to be aw@@ are of how much return on inves@@ tment you are ge@@ tting for your exp@@ en@@ di@@ ture.
It needs to create sal@@ es growth for you@@ , or there is a proble@@ m with the promotion a@@ spec@@ t of the marketing mix@@ .
M@@ AR@@ KE@@ T RES@@ E@@ AR@@ C@@ H
For you@@ , your ad ag@@ ency and the P@@ R ag@@ ency to know the best ways to t@@ alk to your consum@@ er or tar@@ get market group@@ , it is important that from time to time you conduct market res@@ earch@@ .
This is when you design ques@@ tions about your product to find out how the market se@@ es it.
F@@ ro@@ m market fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k, you are able to make ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments in your marketing plan and some@@ times even your business plan to improve the business as a who@@ le.
Research can be lar@@ ge sc@@ ale or small sc@@ ale and can use quanti@@ t@@ ative (@@ num@@ b@@ ers@@ ) or quali@@ t@@ ative (@@ descri@@ p@@ tiv@@ e) meas@@ ur@@ es.

Manag@@ ing a Small Business : Management
It is very important to plan for the fu@@ ture of your busin@@ ess.
If you do not l@@ ook a@@ he@@ ad, there may be events that come your way which you do not know how to deal with@@ .
When this happ@@ ens@@ , you end up re@@ acting to a situ@@ ation ra@@ ther than having a cal@@ m appro@@ ach when de@@ aling with a proble@@ m.
Mo@@ st business problems can be sol@@ ved if you can minim@@ ise the sur@@ pris@@ es that come al@@ ong the wa@@ y.
Re@@ acting to a proble@@ m in@@ stead of having a general plan be@@ for@@ eh@@ and can le@@ ad to b@@ ad business deci@@ sions that could har@@ m the business long ter@@ m.
In any business situ@@ ation you would like to be in a position to take advan@@ t@@ age of opportun@@ iti@@ es, and not be on@@ e-@@ ste@@ p be@@ hin@@ d fix@@ ing up old problems that could have been a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded through car@@ ef@@ ul business plann@@ ing.
How often should business planning be don@@ e?
Gener@@ al@@ ly, business planning is an on@@ going proc@@ ess.
This process should be done before the start of every month c@@ yc@@ le.
How does one do a business plan@@ ?
Comm@@ it on pap@@ er what your the sal@@ es objec@@ tives are and any other go@@ als you need to achi@@ eve to improve the busin@@ ess.
Once this is li@@ ste@@ d, and the month is comple@@ te, you can com@@ par@@ e whether you have achiev@@ ed these sal@@ es and the other go@@ als at the end of each month@@ .
How do I st@@ ay on to@@ p of my fiel@@ d, even if I am a small busin@@ ess@@ ?
You can do this review with other members of staff or an advis@@ or who speci@@ ali@@ z@@ es in your field of busin@@ ess.
Getting in@@ si@@ ght from throughout the business is us@@ ef@@ ul and hel@@ ps br@@ ain@@ stor@@ m fu@@ ture ide@@ as for your business that may not have come up in da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day activi@@ ties.
An annual review is h@@ ard work but in most cases cre@@ ates opportun@@ ities.
This is especially tr@@ ue if you wish to gro@@ w your busin@@ ess, or laun@@ ch intern@@ ation@@ al@@ ly.
IM@@ POR@@ T@@ AN@@ T A@@ RE@@ AS OF BUSINESS PLANNING
Employ@@ ment
Ex@@ am@@ ple@@ : "@@ What are your fu@@ ture st@@ aff@@ ing ne@@ ed@@ s@@ ?@@ "
You also need to know when you can af@@ ford to hi@@ re more staff and what you can af@@ ford to pay them@@ .
C@@ as@@ h f@@ low
In some organ@@ iz@@ ations, especially small busin@@ ess@@ es, it is important to neg@@ o@@ ti@@ ate with your clients that they sp@@ li@@ t pay@@ ments (for example you get paid 10@@ % up f@@ ron@@ t, 30@@ % when you complete the first phase of the project and the remain@@ der when the enti@@ re project is comple@@ te@@ d@@ ).
Sal@@ es
You need to know when there are s@@ low times in your busin@@ ess.
For some busin@@ ess@@ es, this could be during the win@@ ter month@@ s, for oth@@ ers win@@ ter could be the bu@@ si@@ est se@@ as@@ on.
To make sure you last - and th@@ rive - from year to year@@ , you will need to know your sal@@ es pat@@ tern over the year@@ , so that you can make allow@@ ance for any times when there is not the same amount of money com@@ ing in from sal@@ es (@@ sal@@ es flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation@@ ).
If this is not work@@ ed out well@@ , the business will not be able to pay its b@@ ills and will be th@@ reat@@ en@@ ed.
If you plan proper@@ ly for sal@@ es flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations, you will have money to ti@@ de you over in the s@@ low month@@ s.

Manag@@ ing a Small Business : Human Resources
Human resource management rela@@ tes to all matters in con@@ nec@@ tion with your st@@ aff@@ ; from rec@@ r@@ uit@@ ment to gri@@ e@@ van@@ ces and termin@@ ation of employ@@ ment.
Manag@@ ing your V@@ alu@@ able Resour@@ c@@ es: St@@ aff
How often have you he@@ ard business people sa@@ y that their gre@@ at@@ est ass@@ ets are their employ@@ e@@ es@@ ?
This is gener@@ ally tr@@ u@@ e, but how do you nur@@ ture these ass@@ ets so they continue to contribu@@ te value to your busin@@ ess@@ ?
These are the most important areas@@ :
* The sal@@ aries and w@@ ages you pay staff need to be competi@@ tiv@@ e.
You need to know what your business can af@@ ford and what industry standards ar@@ e.
If you can@@ 't pay as much as your competi@@ tors do@@ , you should offer your employees some form of bon@@ us based on the how pro@@ f@@ it@@ able the business is.
* Wor@@ king conditions must be in line with the health and safety standards of the law@@ .
* You must have a written employment contract with every employ@@ e@@ e, and you must ensure that they under@@ stand the rules of their employ@@ ment.
This is especially important with matters con@@ nec@@ ted to:
* ab@@ sen@@ te@@ eis@@ m
* si@@ ck pay
* under@@ -@@ performance
* gri@@ ev@@ ance proced@@ ur@@ es.
Con@@ si@@ der what would happ@@ en if a key person in your business su@@ d@@ den@@ ly could not work for an exten@@ ded period of time.
It is important to know when it is time to get form@@ al Human Resource support for your busin@@ ess.
Once a business re@@ ach@@ es a specific siz@@ e, you may find it necessary to em@@ plo@@ y a Human Resources Manag@@ er.
The Social Plan Fund
If your business experi@@ ences the th@@ re@@ at of job los@@ ses or the who@@ le business is it@@ self th@@ reat@@ en@@ ed, and it can be sho@@ wn that if this happ@@ ens@@ , it will affec@@ t the loc@@ al, regional or national industry or sector ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly@@ ; then assistance from the government can be app@@ lied for in the form of the Social Plan Fun@@ d.
This assistance includes information and services to re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ed workers and employ@@ ers.
The aim of the information is to try and ab@@ s@@ or@@ b re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ed workers into the labour mark@@ et.
This is pro@@ bab@@ ly more appropriate for bi@@ g businesses or industr@@ ies such as clo@@ th@@ ing, min@@ ing or te@@ lec@@ ommun@@ ic@@ ations where employees can be vul@@ ner@@ able to lar@@ ge sc@@ ale re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ments when glob@@ al econom@@ ics affec@@ t the industry neg@@ ati@@ vel@@ y.

The individual hi@@ m@@ self de@@ tec@@ ts most ab@@ nor@@ ma@@ lities in the testi@@ s.
The best way to find ab@@ nor@@ ma@@ lities is through testi@@ cular self@@ -@@ examin@@ ation.
T@@ esti@@ cular S@@ elf@@ -@@ Ex@@ amin@@ ation (@@ T@@ SE@@ )
T@@ SE is best perform@@ ed after was@@ hing with war@@ m water, a war@@ m b@@ ath or sho@@ wer@@ .

Cont@@ acting your Community Police Forum
A Community Police Forum (C@@ P@@ F@@ ) consists of organisations and institutions such as school@@ s, r@@ ate@@ pay@@ ers associ@@ ations, civi@@ c organis@@ ations, businesses and relig@@ ious institu@@ tions, working in part@@ nership with the local polic@@ e.

The C@@ P@@ F develop@@ s year@@ ly community safety plan@@ s, which identi@@ fy pri@@ or@@ ities and needs for the area.
These pri@@ or@@ ities and needs are set by the commun@@ ity, through the C@@ P@@ F@@ , and form part of the local police st@@ ation@@ 's operational plan@@ .
A C@@ P@@ F may also plan and imple@@ ment its own safety projec@@ ts, and can apply to the provincial government for funding for these projec@@ ts.
St@@ ation C@@ ommission@@ ers of local police st@@ ations are responsible for establish@@ ing C@@ P@@ F@@ s in their areas.
Al@@ most all police station areas in the Western Cape have a C@@ P@@ F@@ .
Each C@@ P@@ F has its own constitution (@@ based on a uni@@ form constitu@@ tion@@ ) and ai@@ m@@ s, and may also have Sub-@@ For@@ ums with specific ai@@ m@@ s.
An Executive Committee of the C@@ P@@ F has to be elected regul@@ ar@@ ly.
The St@@ ation C@@ ommissioner must al@@ ways be a member of the Executive Comm@@ itte@@ e, but n@@ either the chair@@ person n@@ or de@@ pu@@ ty@@ -@@ chair@@ person may be polic@@ e.
You can contact your C@@ P@@ F by contac@@ ting your local police st@@ ation.

Cont@@ ac@@ t@@ ing, Registering or Getting Training and E@@ qui@@ p@@ ment for your Neighbourhood Watch
A n@@ eighbourhood watch is a group of citizens from a n@@ eighbourhood who ag@@ ree to form a n@@ eighbourhood watch after disc@@ us@@ sing the ide@@ a with people who live in their area.
The aim of a n@@ eighbourhood watch is to encour@@ age good relations among resid@@ ents and to serve as a "@@ wat@@ ch@@ do@@ g@@ " for that commun@@ ity, some@@ times by pat@@ ro@@ ll@@ ing, and some@@ times by si@@ mp@@ ly being al@@ er@@ t to criminal activ@@ ity and noti@@ f@@ ying the police when it occ@@ ur@@ s.
The police will try to as@@ sign police reserv@@ is@@ ts to su@@ per@@ v@@ ise pat@@ ro@@ ls wh@@ en@@ ever n@@ eighbourhood wat@@ ches do pat@@ rol@@ .
Some n@@ eighbourhood watch members may become police reserv@@ is@@ ts.
Each n@@ eighbourhood watch has an area with c@@ le@@ ar b@@ ound@@ ari@@ es, within a police area.
There can be more than one n@@ eighbourhood watch in an area cover@@ ed by one police st@@ ation, as police station areas are very lar@@ ge.
Your n@@ eighbourhood watch should register with the local police and Community Police Forum (C@@ P@@ F@@ ) in your police area.
To register you must adop@@ t a constitution and co@@ de of conduct in line with the Provincial Constitution and Co@@ de of C@@ ond@@ uc@@ t for Neighbourhood Watch Str@@ uc@@ tur@@ es.
In early 2003 there were 2@@ 77 registered n@@ eighbourhood wat@@ ches in the Western Cape.
Once your n@@ eighbourhood watch is register@@ ed, you can ask for financial and organis@@ ational sup@@ port, as well as equipment and train@@ ing, from the Western Cape Department of Community Saf@@ et@@ y.
M@@ ore than 150 n@@ eighbourhood wat@@ ches in the Western Cape have already received equipment and training from the Depart@@ ment.
The kin@@ ds of training you can get from the Department include:
* conflic@@ t resolution
* criminal procedure
* domestic viol@@ ence
* human rights
* fi@@ re fi@@ gh@@ ting
* first aid
* radi@@ o procedure
* self@@ -@@ def@@ ence.
The equipment you can get from the Department inclu@@ d@@ es:
* accident t@@ ap@@ e
* bat@@ ons
* first aid k@@ its
* hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s

Protection from D@@ om@@ estic A@@ bu@@ se
If you are the vic@@ ti@@ m of domestic abuse and your abus@@ er is someone with whom you are in a domestic rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p, you may apply for a protection or@@ der, in terms of the D@@ om@@ estic Vi@@ ol@@ ence Ac@@ t.
A protection order has condi@@ tions, which set out what the abus@@ er may not do@@ .
S@@ hould the abus@@ er bre@@ ak these conditions then he can be arres@@ ted.
If the abuse invol@@ ves a criminal off@@ ence a charge can be la@@ id for that off@@ ence.
The word@@ s '@@ domestic rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ ' co@@ ver many rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
You are in a domestic rel@@ ation@@ ship with someone if you@@ :
* A@@ re or were married to each oth@@ er, whether you live together or not
* A@@ re sam@@ e-@@ se@@ x part@@ n@@ ers, whether you live together or not
* W@@ ere or are eng@@ age@@ d, dat@@ ing, or in a customary rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p, or in any rel@@ ation@@ ship you or the other person be@@ li@@ ev@@ es to be ro@@ man@@ tic
* H@@ ave been in a sexual rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p, even for a sh@@ ort time
* A@@ re the parents of a child
* Sh@@ are or rec@@ ently shar@@ ed the same home or resid@@ ence.
D@@ om@@ estic ab@@ use@@ ' inclu@@ d@@ es:
* physical abuse
* sexual abuse
* emo@@ tional abuse
* verb@@ al abuse
* psy@@ cho@@ logical abuse
* economic abuse
* in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation
* st@@ al@@ king
* dam@@ age to property
* when you are not living toge@@ th@@ er, en@@ tering your property without your per@@ mis@@ sion.
* any other control@@ ling be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our that may c@@ ause har@@ m to your saf@@ et@@ y, health or well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
However, if you are the vic@@ ti@@ m of a type of domestic abuse that is also a crime you can choo@@ se to apply for a protection or@@ der, or la@@ y a criminal char@@ ge, or do bo@@ th@@ .
Ac@@ ts of abuse which are also cri@@ mes include common ass@@ a@@ ul@@ t, ass@@ a@@ ult with the inten@@ tion of do@@ ing gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ di@@ ly har@@ m, in@@ dec@@ ent ass@@ a@@ ul@@ t, rap@@ e, inc@@ es@@ t, at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted m@@ ur@@ der, ma@@ li@@ ci@@ ous dam@@ age to proper@@ ty, poin@@ ting a fire@@ ar@@ m, and abuse of anim@@ al@@ s.
Once you have the protection or@@ der, if your abus@@ er bre@@ ach@@ es (@@ bre@@ ak@@ s the conditions of@@ ) a protection or@@ der, then that is a crime and he can be char@@ ged with the crime of con@@ tem@@ pt of court (@@ even if the bre@@ ach@@ ing act is not ordin@@ ar@@ ily a cri@@ me, for example, control@@ ling be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our@@ ).
H@@ av@@ ing a protection order means having the power to have your abus@@ er arres@@ ted as soon as he comm@@ its an act of abus@@ e.
All you need to do is report that he has bre@@ ached the condi@@ tions, and the police must act immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
Be@@ fore ge@@ tting a protection or@@ der, you can get an inter@@ im protection order qui@@ te qu@@ ick@@ ly by fil@@ ling in certain form@@ s, and that inter@@ im order will speci@@ fy a date at which the fin@@ al order will be considered (@@ a return d@@ ate@@ ).
Once a fin@@ al order is ma@@ de, it is permanent and can only be chan@@ ged by applying to the cour@@ ts.
The kin@@ ds of protection you can get in a protection order include conditions that@@ :
* Your abus@@ er must not comm@@ it any act of domestic abus@@ e.
* Your abus@@ er must pay you ren@@ t, mor@@ t@@ g@@ age pay@@ ments or other emergency mon@@ e@@ y.
* The police must s@@ ei@@ z@@ e any fire@@ arms or dan@@ ger@@ ous weapons in your abus@@ er's pos@@ ses@@ sion.
* The police must go with you and help you to collec@@ t your personal proper@@ ty.

If it does not appe@@ ar you mi@@ ght suff@@ er har@@ m, then the police may in@@ stead give your abus@@ er a notice to appe@@ ar in court on a criminal charge of bre@@ ach@@ ing the protection or@@ der.

Life Skills Training for Y@@ oung People
The Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ali@@ s Acade@@ my offers a social crime pre@@ vention and up@@ lif@@ tment programme tar@@ ge@@ ting "@@ youth at ris@@ k@@ "@@ .
I@@ ts aim is to em@@ power young people to take control of their li@@ ves and give them the t@@ ools to become econom@@ ically productive and be positive change agents within their commun@@ ities.
This met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ sis will take them@@ , via inten@@ se physi@@ c@@ al, mental and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual development a@@ way from a life which could tur@@ n to crime and g@@ ang@@ ster@@ is@@ m, to one with potential for personal gro@@ w@@ th, financial security and community servic@@ e.
It is a preven@@ t@@ ative initi@@ ative as op@@ posed to a rehabilitation programme.
This means that it is ge@@ ar@@ ed to developing young ad@@ ults with assess@@ ed potential for gro@@ w@@ th, ra@@ ther than sol@@ ving or at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to fi@@ x existing proble@@ m@@ s.
The tar@@ get pop@@ ulation is young people between the ages of 17 and 22 years old who have at@@ tained a minimum educ@@ ational level of G@@ rade 10 (@@ Stand@@ ard 8@@ ), are pres@@ ently un@@ employed and have no criminal recor@@ d.
The programme is currently sup@@ ported and fun@@ ded by the Provincial Govern@@ ment.
The Acade@@ my is situ@@ ated on the Por@@ ter Estate in Tok@@ ai@@ .
St@@ ar@@ ted in June 200@@ 0, each programme accommod@@ ates between 100 and 120 stud@@ ents from the Western Cape, who have under@@ g@@ one a rig@@ or@@ ous sel@@ ec@@ tion proc@@ ess.
Participation is enti@@ re@@ ly volun@@ tar@@ y, and fre@@ e, to all who atten@@ d.
The programme is divi@@ ded into 5 ph@@ as@@ es:
1. Op@@ portun@@ ity
2. O@@ ri@@ ent@@ ation
3. Wil@@ der@@ ness
4. Sk@@ ill@@ s@@ and
5. Community
The Op@@ portun@@ ity phase incorpor@@ ates the marketing of the programme to community organisations and the pro@@ spec@@ tive stud@@ en@@ ts.
The remain@@ ing 4 ph@@ ases make up the 12 - week programme.
D@@ uring each phase the stud@@ ents will be ex@@ posed to exten@@ sive physical activ@@ ity and spor@@ t, together with different areas of intel@@ lec@@ tual and social develop@@ ment.
They will ac@@ qui@@ re skills which can be app@@ lied in the job mark@@ et.
The O@@ ri@@ ent@@ ation phase la@@ ys the f@@ oundation and establish@@ es a dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ed da@@ ily rou@@ t@@ ine where ne@@ at@@ ness and personal hy@@ gi@@ ene are em@@ ph@@ asi@@ s@@ ed.
This is c@@ ou@@ ple@@ d with go@@ al sett@@ ing, mo@@ tiv@@ ation, proble@@ m sol@@ ving and communic@@ ation.
The stud@@ ents also co@@ ver basic health and nu@@ tri@@ tion, level one first a@@ id@@ , fi@@ re fi@@ gh@@ ting and environmental awar@@ en@@ ess.
They then sp@@ end two weeks in the Wil@@ der@@ ness phase at Ou@@ tw@@ ard B@@ oun@@ d, where personal li@@ mits are tes@@ ted, learning much about their streng@@ ths and we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ es, as well as te@@ am@@ work and the power of nat@@ ure@@ .
Ab@@ s@@ ei@@ l@@ ing, k@@ ay@@ ak@@ ing, ro@@ ck cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing and long h@@ ik@@ es are fe@@ at@@ ured in this ph@@ as@@ e.
On retur@@ ning to Cape Town, the stud@@ ents are allow@@ ed visi@@ tors for the first time sin@@ ce the start of the cour@@ se.
By this time all are su@@ pre@@ mel@@ y f@@ it, high@@ ly mo@@ tiv@@ ated and their self conf@@ id@@ ence is ob@@ vi@@ ou@@ s.
Mo@@ st of the s@@ mo@@ kers will have given up the hab@@ it by this time.
Un@@ der the ex@@ per@@ t guid@@ ance of in@@ struc@@ tors from Wes@@ t@@ la@@ ke Tech@@ nical Col@@ le@@ ge, stud@@ ents are intro@@ duced to the Basic En@@ gin@@ e@@ ering Skills Training (@@ B@@ .@@ E@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ T) course over the four weeks of the Skills ph@@ as@@ e.

* br@@ ic@@ k la@@ ying
* met@@ al

* elec@@ trical circ@@ uit@@ ry and other cour@@ s@@ es, are cover@@ ed in hand@@ s-@@ on cla@@ ss@@ es.
In 2002 security train@@ ing, ta@@ il@@ oring and ca@@ tering were ad@@ ded to the cur@@ ricul@@ um@@ .
Sports co@@ ach@@ ing is intro@@ duced during this ph@@ as@@ e.
The fin@@ al Community phase is the prepar@@ ation for life in the re@@ al world and foc@@ uses on business sur@@ vi@@ val sk@@ ill@@ s, an intro@@ duction to compu@@ ters and c@@ are@@ er guid@@ anc@@ e.
A wi@@ de variety of soci@@ ally accep@@ table activities are also eng@@ aged in such as ar@@ ts and cr@@ af@@ ts, sing@@ ing, ch@@ ess, and read@@ ing.
Th@@ rough@@ out the programme the stud@@ ents are required to do community work and volun@@ te@@ eris@@ m is acti@@ vely promo@@ ted.
Af@@ fi@@ li@@ ation with a community organisation is encour@@ aged while much em@@ ph@@ asis is pla@@ ced on positive community work like school sports co@@ ach@@ ing, n@@ eighbourhood watch pat@@ rol@@ ling and impro@@ ving their quality of life at home through gre@@ ening projects and other clean@@ -@@ up activi@@ ties.
The Gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate Affairs department monit@@ ors the progres@@ s of gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates for five years after the course and ens@@ ures that information regarding any volun@@ teer or work opportunities are communic@@ ated as an on@@ going service to both gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates and stakehol@@ ders.
Where 20 or more gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates exis@@ t in a particular are@@ a, community c@@ l@@ ub@@ s have been established to assist and support them@@ .
Gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates are in gre@@ at de@@ m@@ and with 67@@ % employed by over 70 businesses throughout the Western Cape.
U@@ nem@@ ploy@@ ed gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates are ab@@ s@@ or@@ bed into projects such as Sw@@ im@@ safe and B@@ amban@@ ani and many oth@@ ers r@@ un by various Government departments and organis@@ ations.
The Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ali@@ s Acade@@ my is aimed main@@ ly at young people from disadvantaged communities in the Western Cape between the ages of 17 and 22@@ .
If you who want to jo@@ in the Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ali@@ s Acade@@ my you s@@ hou@@ l@@ d@@ :

Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Community Polic@@ ing > S@@ etting up a City Impro@@ vement District
A CI@@ D mak@@ es an agreement with the municipality so that more money (@@ a CI@@ D le@@ vy@@ ) can be collec@@ ted from r@@ ate@@ pay@@ ers in the area over and above the normal rates char@@ ges@@ .
This ex@@ tr@@ a money is used to give '@@ to@@ p up@@ ' services in the area cover@@ ed by the CI@@ D@@ .
The ex@@ tr@@ a services usually include ex@@ tr@@ a security and clean@@ s@@ ing.
CI@@ D@@ s have also been called Comm@@ ercial Impro@@ vement Distr@@ ic@@ ts (@@ CI@@ D@@ s) or Res@@ identi@@ al Impro@@ vement Distr@@ ic@@ ts (R@@ ID@@ s) in the pa@@ st@@ .
An example of an established City Impro@@ vement District is the Cape Town Central City Impro@@ vement Distr@@ ic@@ t.
This CI@@ D covers the areas bor@@ der@@ ed by these roads in c@@ entral Cape Town@@ : B@@ uit@@ en@@ gr@@ ach@@ t, B@@ uit@@ ens@@ ing@@ el, O@@ ran@@ ge, Gre@@ y's P@@ ass@@ , Qu@@ een Vic@@ tori@@ a, W@@ ale, Sp@@ in, P@@ le@@ in, Ro@@ eland@@ , C@@ an@@ ter@@ bur@@ y, Dar@@ l@@ ing, C@@ ast@@ le, Strand@@ , Ad@@ der@@ le@@ y, He@@ er@@ en@@ gr@@ ach@@ t, Old Mar@@ in@@ e, Ci@@ vic@@ , Her@@ tz@@ o@@ g Bou@@ lev@@ ar@@ d, O@@ sw@@ al@@ d Pi@@ ro@@ w and T@@ able Bay Bou@@ lev@@ ar@@ d.
The Cape Town Par@@ t@@ nership man@@ ages the Cape Town Central CI@@ D@@ .
The service contract between the Cape Town Central CI@@ D and the City of Cape Town says that the City of Cape Town must provide ex@@ tr@@ a guar@@ ante@@ ed services in the Cape Town CI@@ D area over and above normal servic@@ es, in return for the CI@@ D lev@@ y.
The CI@@ D lev@@ y is a de@@ dic@@ ated le@@ vy@@ : the money ra@@ ised from the lev@@ y must go to the CI@@ D@@ .
This means that the lev@@ y must be used for services in terms of the business plan agre@@ ed to by property own@@ ers in the CI@@ D and cannot be re@@ distribu@@ ted for use outside the CI@@ D@@ .
Le@@ vies char@@ ged to property own@@ ers are some@@ times paid by property own@@ ers, or some@@ times passed on to ten@@ an@@ ts, in the same way that rates ar@@ e.
There are more Cape Town CI@@ D@@ s in various st@@ ages of being establish@@ ed.
These include the Gre@@ en Po@@ int CI@@ D@@ , the O@@ ran@@ j@@ ek@@ loof CI@@ D@@ , the Hi@@ g@@ gov@@ ale CI@@ D@@ , the Se@@ a Po@@ int CI@@ D and the Camp@@ s Bay CI@@ D@@ , which all f@@ all under the City of Cape Town.
The City of Cape Town dr@@ af@@ ted a by@@ -@@ law for CI@@ D@@ s in 200@@ 3, which is in the process of being pass@@ ed.
This by@@ -@@ law gi@@ ves the procedure that must be follow@@ ed for establish@@ ing a CI@@ D in the City of Cape Town.
Any own@@ er of property that pa@@ ys rates in the City of Cape Town area can apply to the Cape Town Council for a CI@@ D to be appro@@ v@@ ed.
The person making the application must pay all costs involved in the application proc@@ ess.
The management body of the CI@@ D even@@ tu@@ ally cre@@ ated can re@@ im@@ bur@@ se some of these costs to the applicant if the application is success@@ ful@@ .
The process invol@@ ves adver@@ ti@@ sing for a public me@@ eting to be hel@@ d, the hol@@ ding of a public me@@ eting to disc@@ us@@ s the CI@@ D@@ , sub@@ mit@@ ting a written application which must include an impro@@ vement plan@@ , payment of a fee to the Counci@@ l, adver@@ ti@@ sing the application and consi@@ dering objec@@ tions to the applic@@ ation, ge@@ tting a City Council deci@@ sion@@ , and ge@@ tting majority support from r@@ ate@@ pay@@ ers.
The written application must have the written appro@@ val of at least 25@@ % in number of the own@@ ers of r@@ ate@@ able proper@@ ties in the are@@ a, and these own@@ ers must repres@@ ent 25@@ % of the r@@ at@@ es@@ -@@ based value of the proper@@ ties in the area.
If the Council appro@@ ves the applic@@ ation, the CI@@ D must within six months of appro@@ val of the application get the written agreement of property own@@ ers in the area that together own at least 50@@ % of all proper@@ ties in number and at least 50@@ % of the rates b@@ as@@ e.
On@@ ly once this majority agreement has been ob@@ tain@@ ed, can the management body imple@@ ment the City Impro@@ vement District Plan@@ .
The management body must be a non-@@ pro@@ fit company (@@ established in terms of Section 21 of the Comp@@ an@@ ies Ac@@ t@@ ), which must be cre@@ ated before the implementation of the City Impro@@ vement District Plan@@ .
National Government is in the process of dr@@ af@@ ting a new law called the Local Government Property R@@ ates B@@ ill@@ .
This new law provides for '@@ special r@@ ating areas@@ ' (@@ cla@@ use 19@@ ), and gi@@ ves guidel@@ ines as to how metro@@ politan municipalities like Cape Town should deal with special r@@ ating areas.
CI@@ D@@ s are special r@@ ating areas.
Any by@@ -@@ law passed will have to comply with this new law@@ .

NE@@ W FI@@ RE@@ AR@@ M@@ S LE@@ GI@@ S@@ L@@ ATION IN E@@ FF@@ EC@@ T F@@ RO@@ M 1 J@@ UL@@ Y 2004
On 1 July 2004, new fire@@ arms contro@@ ls enter@@ ed into effec@@ t.
The legislation govern@@ ing the lic@@ enc@@ ing of fire@@ arms is the Fi@@ re@@ arms Cont@@ rol Ac@@ t.
This law requi@@ res people who apply for firearm lic@@ ences to under@@ go a compet@@ ency test@@ .
There is a period between 2004 and De@@ c 2006 during which existing fire@@ arms own@@ ers will be able to r@@ ene@@ w their lic@@ enc@@ es.
In terms of the Act, people who apply for firearm lic@@ ences will have to under@@ go a compet@@ ency test before being able to apply for a firearm lic@@ ence.
SAP@@ S will issue compet@@ ency certific@@ ates to success@@ ful applic@@ an@@ ts, who will then be entitled to own fire@@ arm@@ s.
HOW TO AP@@ PL@@ Y FOR A LICEN@@ CE
In order to get a licence for a fire@@ ar@@ m, you must@@ :
* G@@ et a compet@@ ency certificate
* Apply for a licence
The compet@@ ency certificate is a new a@@ spec@@ t of fire@@ arms lic@@ enc@@ ing in South Africa.
To get the certific@@ ate, the applicant must@@ :
* B@@ e 21 years old
* P@@ as@@ s a thor@@ ough bac@@ k@@ groun@@ d check
* No@@ t have a criminal record for a variety of cri@@ mes
* K@@ now the law
* K@@ now how to use a firearm (@@ you must have completed a basic training course at an acc@@ redi@@ ted training institu@@ tion@@ ).
The certificate is valid for five years and must be valid at the time of applying for the lic@@ ence.
The police or a court can dec@@ l@@ are you un@@ fit to car@@ ry a fire@@ ar@@ m.
This declaration la@@ sts for five years.
To apply for the compet@@ ency certificate you need to complete the application form (@@ SAP@@ S 5@@ 17@@ ) and submit it to the D@@ esi@@ gn@@ ated Fi@@ re@@ arms Offic@@ er (@@ D@@ F@@ O@@ ) at your nearest police st@@ ation.
SAP@@ S have prepar@@ ed det@@ ailed in@@ struc@@ tions on how to complete the application form for a compet@@ ency certific@@ ate.
If you have a valid compet@@ ency certific@@ ate, you can then apply for a fire@@ arms lic@@ ence.
To apply for the licence you need to:
* Submit an application form (F@@ or@@ m SA@@ P 27@@ 1) at the police station nearest to your home and pay a prescribed fee by af@@ fix@@ ing a revenue st@@ amp to the application form@@ .
SAP@@ S have prepar@@ ed det@@ ailed in@@ struc@@ tions on com@@ pl@@ eting the form@@ .
* Si@@ gn a form indic@@ ating that you are aw@@ are of the law applicable to firearm own@@ ers.
* M@@ ake a declaration regarding any previous con@@ vic@@ tions you may ha@@ v@@ e.
* H@@ ave your f@@ inger@@ prin@@ ts tak@@ en.
On@@ ly very small or s@@ atellite police st@@ ations do not have a D@@ F@@ O@@ .
E@@ ven if a station does not have a D@@ F@@ O@@ , there will be someone at the police station who will help you.
The D@@ F@@ O will help you with com@@ pl@@ eting the form and inter@@ view you.
Some D@@ F@@ O@@ s require applic@@ ants to make a pri@@ or appoin@@ t@@ ment.
When you have submitted the applic@@ ation, the D@@ F@@ O will issue you a confir@@ m@@ ation of recei@@ pt certificate and then process your applic@@ ation.
The D@@ F@@ O will also check for a criminal record or a record of domestic viol@@ ence, and whether you already have a firearm lic@@ ence.
H@@ av@@ ing car@@ ri@@ ed out all the chec@@ k@@ s, the D@@ F@@ O will for@@ ward the application form and supporting docu@@ mentation to the Central Fi@@ re@@ arms Reg@@ ister (C@@ F@@ R@@ ) in Pretoria, al@@ ong with a recommend@@ ation on whether or not a licence should be gran@@ ted.
The C@@ F@@ R then mak@@ es the fin@@ al deci@@ sion.
The enti@@ re process usually takes about two month@@ s, if there are no problems with the applic@@ ation.
S@@ hould a licence be ref@@ us@@ ed, you may fi@@ le an appe@@ al.
HOW L@@ ON@@ G IS THE LICEN@@ CE V@@ A@@ LI@@ D FOR@@ ?
All fire@@ arms lic@@ ences must be renew@@ ed ever@@ y:
* T@@ w@@ o years for business purposes
* Fi@@ ve years for self@@ -@@ defence
* T@@ en years for h@@ un@@ ting or sports s@@ hoo@@ ting
HOW MAN@@ Y FI@@ RE@@ AR@@ M@@ S CAN ON@@ E PER@@ SO@@ N O@@ W@@ N@@ ?
The law li@@ mits the number of gun@@ s for which you can get a lic@@ ence, dep@@ ending on your ne@@ ed@@ s:
* One g@@ un for self@@ -@@ defence
* U@@ p to four fire@@ arms for occ@@ asion@@ al h@@ un@@ ters or spor@@ ts@@ s@@ hoo@@ ters (@@ but only one hand@@ gun@@ )
* No li@@ mit for de@@ dic@@ ated h@@ un@@ ters and sports s@@ hoo@@ ter@@ s, but you must pro@@ ve that you are a member of a h@@ un@@ ting or sports organisation and must s@@ how a need for additional fire@@ arms
* No li@@ mit for people who use fire@@ arms for business purposes (@@ eg security compan@@ i@@ es, firearm in@@ struc@@ tor@@ s, g@@ ame h@@ un@@ ter@@ s) but there str@@ ict conditions ap@@ pl@@ y.

* z@@ on@@ ing and building
* water po@@ l@@ lution
* was@@ te management

Municipal Courts also deal with matters referred from the South African Police Service (@@ SAP@@ S) that invol@@ ve traffic off@@ enc@@ es.
There are ten Municipal Courts within the City of Cape Town area.
You should be able to pay a traffic fine from any@@ where in the City of Cape Town at any of these Municipal Cour@@ ts.
Mo@@ st Municipal Courts are hou@@ sed within the Magistrates' Court in that area.
The National Department of Justice provides the mag@@ istr@@ ates for the Municipal Cour@@ t.
The City of Cape Town provides the prosecu@@ tor@@ s, ven@@ u@@ es and administr@@ ation. (The Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions has given c@@ ity council offici@@ als authority to pro@@ sec@@ ute on municipal by@@ -@@ law mat@@ ter@@ s.
The Director has the power to deleg@@ ate authority to any offici@@ al, or to any employ@@ e@@ e, the power to prosecu@@ te@@ .@@ )
If you would like to pay a traffic fin@@ e, go to the enquiri@@ es des@@ k at your nearest Municipal Cour@@ t.
They will send you to the relevant person who de@@ als with the area in which your traffic off@@ ence occ@@ ur@@ re@@ d.
You can then pay the fine at the cas@@ h office.
Please note that the enquiri@@ es office clo@@ ses at 3.@@ 00@@ p@@ m and the cas@@ h office at 3.@@ 30@@ p@@ m.
If you have been sum@@ mon@@ sed to appe@@ ar in a Municipal Cour@@ t, the relevant Court will be indic@@ ated on your sum@@ mon@@ s, as well as the time and date that you should app@@ ear@@ .

Re@@ porting R@@ ap@@ e
If you have been rap@@ ed or s@@ exually ass@@ a@@ ul@@ ted, you can report this to the polic@@ e.
It is your cho@@ ice whether to re@@ port, but if you do not report then your case will not be investig@@ ated or prosecu@@ ted.
Police are not allow@@ ed to ref@@ use to investigate your case if you report it.
However, if there is to@@ o li@@ tt@@ le evidence after an investig@@ ation by the polic@@ e, a prosecu@@ tor may decide not to pro@@ sec@@ ute your cas@@ e.
There is no time li@@ mit for re@@ porting a rap@@ e cas@@ e, while other sexual off@@ ences have a 20@@ -@@ year time li@@ mit@@ .
However, if you do not report qui@@ te soon after the rap@@ e happ@@ ened then physical evidence may be lo@@ st and any wit@@ nesses may be diffic@@ ult to fin@@ d, which will make success@@ ful pro@@ sec@@ ution more diffic@@ ult@@ .
Al@@ so@@ , when you re@@ port, the police will take you to hospital where you will be given medic@@ ation to prevent HIV/@@ A@@ id@@ s.
It is important to take this medic@@ ation as soon as possible after being rap@@ ed.
If you are a chil@@ d, or re@@ porting on behalf of a chil@@ d, the case is de@@ alt with in a different man@@ n@@ er.

C@@ AL@@ L THE PO@@ LI@@ CE
You can report rap@@ e by going to the clo@@ s@@ est police st@@ ation.
You can also report rap@@ e by tele@@ ph@@ on@@ ing the clo@@ s@@ est police st@@ ation.
If you report by ph@@ on@@ e, the police will send a police van to f@@ et@@ ch you.
However, because the police van may not be available immedi@@ ate@@ ly, you may have to w@@ ai@@ t a long time to be f@@ et@@ ch@@ ed.
If you are b@@ ad@@ ly h@@ ur@@ t, you should call an amb@@ ul@@ ance directly or the emergency number in@@ ste@@ ad@@ .
U@@ su@@ al@@ ly, you are sup@@ posed to report rap@@ e at the police station clo@@ s@@ est to where the rap@@ e happ@@ ened (@@ which mi@@ ght be f@@ ar a@@ way from where you li@@ ve@@ ).
However, if you have g@@ one to another police st@@ ation, the police are not allow@@ ed to send you a@@ wa@@ y.
They must do the first ste@@ ps of the investig@@ ation, including op@@ ening a case do@@ ck@@ et and the medical examin@@ ation, and give the case to the correc@@ t police station af@@ ter@@ war@@ d@@ s.
At the police st@@ ation, you can ask to spe@@ ak to a w@@ om@@ an police offici@@ al.
However, a w@@ om@@ an may not al@@ ways be availa@@ ble.
You do not have to give all the details of what happ@@ ened in the charge office when re@@ porting the rap@@ e.
Af@@ ter you have said that you want to report a rap@@ e, you should be taken to a private sp@@ ace such as an offic@@ e, or to the tra@@ uma ro@@ om@@ , which is a more com@@ for@@ table ro@@ om that often also has train@@ ed volun@@ te@@ ers to help you.
Mo@@ st police st@@ ations have tra@@ uma ro@@ oms that are sup@@ posed to be open all the ti@@ me, even on week@@ ends and at ni@@ gh@@ t.
MA@@ K@@ ING A ST@@ ATE@@ MENT
You need only give a brief state@@ ment of what happ@@ ened and have the rap@@ e recor@@ ded in the occ@@ ur@@ r@@ ence b@@ ook (@@ a b@@ ook in which all cri@@ mes are recor@@ de@@ d@@ ) at the police st@@ ation, before being taken to have a medical examin@@ ation.
You should try to give a det@@ ailed descri@@ ption of the rap@@ is@@ t and where you last sa@@ w him immedi@@ ately so that the police can try to ar@@ rest him as soon as pos@@ si@@ ble.
THE ME@@ D@@ IC@@ AL E@@ X@@ A@@ MIN@@ ATION
A state doctor (@@ the District Sur@@ ge@@ on@@ ) will do the medical examin@@ ation, usually at a hospit@@ al.
You can get a private doctor to do the examin@@ ation, but they are often not train@@ ed in collec@@ ting for@@ ensi@@ c evidence and may not have the time to go to cour@@ t.
The doctor must also give you medic@@ ation to prevent HIV/@@ A@@ id@@ s.
B@@ ec@@ ause the aim of the medical examin@@ ation is to collec@@ t for@@ ensi@@ c evid@@ ence, you should not was@@ h before the medical examin@@ ation, as this may was@@ h a@@ way evid@@ ence.
You should also bring the clo@@ th@@ es you were we@@ aring at the time of the rap@@ e so that they can also be examin@@ ed for evid@@ ence.
If the police ar@@ rest a suspec@@ t, they may need to hold an identity par@@ ade where you will have to poin@@ t out the rap@@ is@@ t if he is one of the people in the identity par@@ ade@@ .
If the police station has a tw@@ o-@@ way mi@@ r@@ r@@ or, then this will be used for the identity par@@ ade@@ .
You do not need to t@@ ou@@ ch the suspec@@ t and you should ref@@ use to do so if anyone ask@@ s you to@@ .
When you give your state@@ ment, you should give as much det@@ ail as possible about what happ@@ en@@ ed, especially on whether the rap@@ is@@ t th@@ reat@@ ened you and whether he was viol@@ ent.
M@@ ake sure the police know if you th@@ ink he kno@@ ws where you live and if you are af@@ r@@ aid he mi@@ ght in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ate you.
This is important information that will help the court decide whether he should be granted b@@ ail or no@@ t, once he is arres@@ ted.
WHAT I@@ F THE S@@ US@@ P@@ EC@@ T GE@@ TS BA@@ I@@ L@@ ?
If the rap@@ is@@ t is granted b@@ ail@@ , the police must inform you@@ , including the conditions of his b@@ ail@@ .
One of the conditions of b@@ ail is al@@ ways that he will not be allow@@ ed to t@@ alk to you or th@@ re@@ ate@@ n you in any wa@@ y.
If he does t@@ alk to you or if he bre@@ ak@@ s any of the other condi@@ tions, you must contact the de@@ tec@@ tive de@@ aling with your case immedi@@ ately and make a state@@ ment about th@@ is.
THE TRI@@ AL
Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate@@ ly, it may take a very long time for your case to go to court for tri@@ al, and if the police cannot find en@@ ough evid@@ ence, the prosecu@@ tor may decide not to prosecu@@ te.
If you have any complaints about how the police have de@@ alt with your cas@@ e, you should lodge a complain@@ t.
You can get help from any of the organisations that help sur@@ vi@@ vor@@ s of sexual viol@@ ence with prepar@@ ing for the trial and with any other problems you may be experi@@ enc@@ ing.
On the day of tri@@ al, try to ar@@ range with the prosecu@@ tor be@@ for@@ eh@@ and that you will ar@@ rive early and have a separ@@ ate place to sit while wa@@ it@@ ing for the trial to star@@ t, as it is common for the rap@@ is@@ t and his sup@@ por@@ ters to make com@@ ments about you within ear@@ sho@@ t and try to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ate you in other wa@@ ys.
Some courts have separ@@ ate wit@@ ness wa@@ it@@ ing ro@@ oms that you can use in@@ stead of wa@@ it@@ ing in the cor@@ rid@@ or with the rap@@ is@@ t and his sup@@ por@@ ter@@ s.
If the court does not have a wit@@ ness wa@@ it@@ ing ro@@ om@@ , ask the prosecu@@ tor to make another office available for you.

Re@@ porting a Crime
To report a crime that has already happ@@ en@@ ed, you should telephone or visit your nearest police st@@ ation.
To report rap@@ e or child abuse there are special consider@@ ations that ap@@ pl@@ y.
In an emergency you should call the emergency police telephone number 101@@ 11 or 112@@ .
Once you have re@@ ported the cri@@ me, you should receive a case number and you should be given the name of the de@@ tec@@ tive who will be investig@@ ating your cas@@ e.
If you are tra@@ um@@ ati@@ sed you can get help for that and if you need wit@@ ness protection that is also availa@@ ble.
If you fe@@ el a firearm needs to be removed from a dan@@ ger@@ ous person you must ask for that@@ .
If you need a protection order for domestic viol@@ ence you can also begin that process at the police st@@ ation.

Getting Wit@@ ness Protection
You can be af@@ r@@ aid of a single person or of a group of peop@@ le.
An@@ yone who is a member of your hou@@ se@@ hold or fam@@ il@@ y, or who is close to you in any wa@@ y, can apply for protection for you if you are unable to do so@@ .
You can apply for a child without the child's guardi@@ an@@ 's (@@ parent or other person responsible for the child@@ ) per@@ mission if@@ :
* The guardi@@ an is a suspec@@ t in the case that the child is a wit@@ ness to@@ , or
* If the child has no guardi@@ an, or
* If the guardi@@ an cannot be f@@ oun@@ d, or
* If it can be sho@@ wn the guardi@@ an is ref@@ using to give per@@ mission un@@ reason@@ ab@@ ly.
You are a wit@@ ness if you are gi@@ ving evidence (@@ testi@@ f@@ ying in court or making an aff@@ id@@ av@@ it@@ ) right no@@ w@@ , or if you may have to give evidence in the fu@@ ture@@ , or if you have given evidence in the pa@@ st@@ .
This evidence can be in a serious criminal cas@@ e, an in@@ ques@@ t, a commission or a tribun@@ al, an investig@@ ation by the In@@ dependent Complain@@ ts Directorate or an ass@@ et for@@ f@@ ei@@ ture cas@@ e.
You or anyone el@@ se th@@ reat@@ ened will be removed from the dan@@ ger@@ ous situ@@ ation as soon as pos@@ si@@ ble.
You will be pla@@ ced into temporary wit@@ ness protec@@ tion, after which your application for permanent protection will be consider@@ ed.
If your application is approved then you will be pla@@ ced in permanent wit@@ ness protec@@ tion.
You must be a wit@@ n@@ ess, or applying on behalf of someone who is a wit@@ n@@ ess, to ask for wit@@ ness protec@@ tion.
You must report your f@@ ear@@ s, the reas@@ on for your f@@ ear@@ s and that you want to apply for wit@@ ness protection to any of the following peop@@ le, who will help you to make an applic@@ ation:
* The investig@@ ating officer (@@ de@@ tec@@ tiv@@ e) who is investig@@ ating the case in which you are a wit@@ n@@ ess.
* The station comm@@ ander or anyone who is in charge at any police station .
* If you are in pris@@ on, the person in charge of the pr@@ ison or a registered social worker at the pris@@ on.
* The public prosecu@@ tor in the case in which you are gi@@ ving evid@@ ence, or the Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions (@@ form@@ er@@ ly kno@@ wn as the At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y-@@ Gener@@ al@@ ) for that area.
* Any member of the Wit@@ ness Protection Un@@ it.
The person you have re@@ ported to will ar@@ range for remo@@ val as soon as possible if you are in immedi@@ ate dan@@ ger@@ .
You will have to fill in an application form after being removed from the dan@@ ger@@ ous situ@@ ation.
The Director of the Wit@@ ness Protection Unit will be to@@ ld within 48 hours that you have been removed to temporary protec@@ tion.
You will be k@@ ept in temporary protection for no longer than two week@@ s.
D@@ uring this time a wit@@ ness protection officer will investigate your applic@@ ation, which includes a risk assessment and an evalu@@ ation of you by a psy@@ cho@@ log@@ is@@ t.
The officer will report to the Director@@ , who will then decide whether to exten@@ d the temporary protec@@ tion, place you in permanent protec@@ tion, or ref@@ use the applic@@ ation.
The Director mi@@ ght ref@@ use the application if they th@@ ink that other ways of protec@@ ting you are better than pla@@ cing you in the permanent protection programme.
If the Director deci@@ des permanent protection is bes@@ t, you will have to sign a protection agree@@ ment.
In this agreement you ag@@ ree to abi@@ de by all the rules of the protection program@@ me, which gener@@ ally invol@@ ve not re@@ ve@@ aling information about the program@@ me, as well as any particular conditions that mi@@ ght have to apply for your cas@@ e.
You will not be pla@@ ced in permanent protection unless you sign this agree@@ ment.
The agreement is set up to ensure your own safety as well as the safety of the wit@@ ness protection officers and everyone related to the programme.
All wit@@ nesses who have k@@ ept to the rules of their protection agreement have remain@@ ed saf@@ e.
Per@@ man@@ ent protection does not me@@ an you will be in the protection programme for the rest of your lif@@ e.
Per@@ man@@ ent protection la@@ sts as long as the th@@ re@@ at against you la@@ st@@ s, plus a ph@@ as@@ ing out period of six week@@ s, follow@@ ed by a dis@@ char@@ ge.
Dis@@ charge may invol@@ ve a new identity being cre@@ ated for you and you may be re@@ loc@@ ate@@ d.
Per@@ man@@ ent protec@@ tion, which continu@@ es until you are dis@@ char@@ ge@@ d, includes the follow@@ ing:
* You and your exten@@ ded fam@@ il@@ y, where necess@@ ary, will be pla@@ ced in a safe hou@@ se which is fur@@ nis@@ hed and self@@ -@@ ca@@ tering (@@ you do not have to pay for this accommod@@ ation@@ ).
* You will be re@@ loc@@ ated a@@ way from the area where you usually live if that is considered necess@@ ary.
* A c@@ lin@@ ical psy@@ cho@@ log@@ is@@ t will do a tra@@ uma and psy@@ cho@@ logical assessment and help you with any tra@@ uma you mi@@ ght be experi@@ enc@@ ing.
* You will under@@ go an in@@ duction programme so that you will know what to exp@@ ec@@ t.
* If you are un@@ employ@@ ed, you will get an allow@@ ance for your basic ne@@ ed@@ s.
* If you are employ@@ ed, you will get a replacement salar@@ y.
* If your children are with you@@ , arran@@ ge@@ ments will be made so that they can go to school@@ .
* Some other costs will also be cover@@ ed, such as your school@@ ing, tran@@ spor@@ t, clo@@ thing and medical co@@ st@@ s.
You can be removed from the protection programme if it is found that you have bro@@ ken any of the r@@ ul@@ es, or it is found that you are ab@@ using the programme in any wa@@ y.
The programme does not tol@@ er@@ ate '@@ information p@@ ed@@ d@@ l@@ ers@@ '@@ , people who pre@@ ten@@ d to be wit@@ nesses so they can go on the programme.
The Wit@@ ness Protection Unit now also provides '@@ af@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ are@@ ' to help you to ad@@ j@@ ust after you leave permanent protection (@@ that is, when you are dis@@ char@@ ged@@ ).
D@@ uring the ph@@ as@@ ing-@@ out perio@@ d, another risk assessment will be don@@ e.
Dis@@ charge from permanent protection will pro@@ bab@@ ly invol@@ ve chan@@ ging your identi@@ ty.
You will be hel@@ p@@ ed to re-@@ integr@@ ate into soci@@ et@@ y.
You may also have to re@@ loc@@ ate perman@@ ently a@@ way from where you used to li@@ v@@ e.
As an example of how this can be don@@ e, if you own an R@@ D@@ P hou@@ se in one are@@ a, this can be sw@@ app@@ ed with an R@@ D@@ P hou@@ se in another area.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing to do with wit@@ ness protection is done in terms of the Wit@@ ness Protection Act 11@@ 2 of 199@@ 8.
There are n@@ ine regional offic@@ es of the Wit@@ ness Protection Un@@ it, one in each of the provin@@ ces.
However, their ex@@ act loc@@ ation is not made publi@@ c.
If you have any qu@@ er@@ ies that you want to direct to the Wit@@ ness Protection Unit it@@ self@@ , you should contact the He@@ ad Office of the Wit@@ ness Protection Un@@ it, which is in Pretoria and forms part of the National Directorate of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions, the prosecu@@ ting authority in South Africa.

Getting Legal Aid
You will have to pas@@ s a '@@ means test@@ '@@ , which means you have to s@@ how that you ear@@ n less than an amount fix@@ ed by the Legal Aid Bo@@ ar@@ d.
This amount v@@ aries if you are single or married and also changes with time.
You also have to s@@ how that you don@@ 't have any other '@@ li@@ qui@@ d ass@@ ets@@ '@@ , such as money in a sav@@ ings accoun@@ t, which could be used to pay for your legal fe@@ es.
You can also only get legal aid for certain types of cas@@ es.
You C@@ AN@@ NO@@ T get legal a@@ id@@ :
* For a criminal case if you are going to ple@@ ad g@@ uil@@ ty.
* For traffic off@@ enc@@ es, including dr@@ un@@ k driving cas@@ es.
* For comm@@ ercial crime char@@ ges such as f@@ ra@@ ud@@ .
* For dr@@ ug de@@ aling char@@ ges@@ .
* On your third or more criminal charge for the same kind of off@@ ence.
* On a case where you have f@@ ailed to pay a deb@@ t in inst@@ al@@ ments as or@@ der@@ ed by the cour@@ t.
* On a case where your est@@ ate is going to be admin@@ ister@@ ed because you can@@ 't pay your deb@@ ts.
* If you are su@@ ing the Legal Aid Board it@@ self for mal@@ practi@@ ce.
* For a maintenance matter that can be deci@@ ded by a maintenance offic@@ er.
* Where you are applying to become in@@ sol@@ v@@ ent (@@ ban@@ kr@@ up@@ t) or have your est@@ ate admin@@ ister@@ ed.
* Where you are su@@ ing for money (@@ dam@@ ag@@ es) for rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ related cla@@ ims such as de@@ fam@@ ation, bre@@ ach of pro@@ mis@@ e to mar@@ ry@@ , inf@@ r@@ inge@@ ment of di@@ gn@@ ity or priv@@ ac@@ y, s@@ educ@@ tion, ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ y, and ali@@ en@@ ation of affec@@ tion (@@ where you want to su@@ e someone who has caused the person to whom you were eng@@ aged to bre@@ ak off the eng@@ age@@ ment@@ ).
You can get legal aid for divor@@ ce cas@@ es, but NO@@ T if@@ :
* There is a reasonable pos@@ sibi@@ lity that you mi@@ ght get together with your sp@@ ou@@ se again@@ .
* The director of the Board be@@ li@@ ev@@ es there h@@ as@@ n@@ 't been en@@ ough of an at@@ tem@@ pt by you and your sp@@ ou@@ se to come to an agree@@ ment.
* You used legal aid before to su@@ e for divor@@ ce but then deci@@ ded not to go a@@ head with the divor@@ ce.
* There are no children involved in the divor@@ ce.
You can get legal aid for a labour mat@@ ter@@ :
* If you are cla@@ im@@ ing un@@ fair dis@@ mis@@ sal (@@ you have been fi@@ red un@@ fair@@ ly@@ ), as long as your claim is made within the time li@@ mits set by the Labour Rel@@ ations Ac@@ t.
* To de@@ m@@ and a mer@@ it re@@ por@@ t.
However, legal aid will be ref@@ used if there are good reasons to be@@ li@@ eve you are not taking up a job on purpose or that you res@@ i@@ gned from a job in order to be granted legal a@@ id@@ .
You can also get legal aid for appe@@ als on all these types of cases li@@ ste@@ d, whether criminal or civil (@@ cases where you are su@@ ing or being su@@ ed@@ ).
For appe@@ al@@ s, the director of the Board must also be@@ li@@ eve that you have a reasonable ch@@ ance of succ@@ ess.
G@@ o to a Legal Aid Board Branch Office or, if there is not one in your are@@ a, to the nearest mag@@ istr@@ ates' court to en@@ qui@@ re about legal a@@ id@@ .
All mag@@ istr@@ ates' courts have a legal aid officer who will help you with your legal aid enquiri@@ es.
At@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys do have a right to ref@@ use a legal aid in@@ struc@@ tion, but they norm@@ ally do not ref@@ us@@ e.
If they do ref@@ us@@ e, a legal aid in@@ struction can be made out to another at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y.
Please note that the Legal Aid Board is not a free legal advice servic@@ e.
It provides financial support for legal matters to the very poor who cannot af@@ ford legal fe@@ es.
However, you can get legal advice and help from law clinics att@@ ached to uni@@ versi@@ ties, and very often these clinics also take legal aid in@@ struc@@ tions from the Legal Aid Bo@@ ar@@ d.
In Stellenbosch, the two organisations are in the same buil@@ d@@ ing.

Cape Gateway is a government service aimed pri@@ mar@@ ily at citizens of the Western Cape, providing information on loc@@ al, provincial and national government.
An initi@@ ative of the Provincial Government of the Western Cape (P@@ G@@ WC@@ ), in part@@ nership with national and local govern@@ men@@ ts, it gi@@ ves e@@ as@@ y access to government information and services.
U@@ p to no@@ w@@ , to get information and servic@@ es, citizens have had to know which government body provides them@@ .
Wit@@ h Cape Gate@@ wa@@ y, information is pres@@ ented from a us@@ er's per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e.
There are three ways to access the information Cape Gateway off@@ ers@@ :
* the website - www.@@ cap@@ eg@@ ate@@ way@@ .gov.za (@@ you@@ '@@ re sur@@ f@@ ing it right no@@ w@@ )
* the contact centre - 08@@ 60 14@@ 2 14@@ 2 (@@ week@@ days 8@@ :00 - 16@@ :@@ 00@@ ; cost of a local telephone call from any@@ where in South Africa)
* the w@@ alk@@ -@@ in centre - 14@@ 2 L@@ ong Street, Cape Town (@@ week@@ days 8@@ :00 - 16@@ :@@ 00@@ ; spe@@ ak with someone fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ fac@@ e)
These three ch@@ ann@@ els aim to make the Cape Gateway service acces@@ sible to the wid@@ est possible audi@@ ence.
This is also addres@@ sed by providing access to the information in Englis@@ h@@ , Afrikaans and Xhosa (@@ the official languages of the Western Cape@@ ).
One of the aims of the South African Constitution is to establish an open demo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y, character@@ ised by trans@@ par@@ ency and accoun@@ t@@ abili@@ ty.
Rights to access information are inclu@@ ded as basic human righ@@ ts.
The Constitution pla@@ ces an oblig@@ ation on org@@ ans of state to dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ate information held by the state as wid@@ ely as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ : "@@ Trans@@ par@@ ency must be fo@@ ster@@ ed by providing the public with ti@@ mel@@ y, acces@@ sible and accur@@ ate inform@@ ation@@ .@@ "

Ba@@ th@@ o P@@ ele (@@ People Fir@@ st@@ ) is the South African govern@@ ment's initi@@ ative to improve the delivery of public services.
Impro@@ ving service delivery is one of the govern@@ ment's eight pri@@ or@@ ities as set out in the Whi@@ te Pap@@ er on the Trans@@ formation of the Public Service (@@ pdf@@ , h@@ t@@ m@@ l@@ )

Application for maintenance
Maintenance is the oblig@@ ation to provide another person@@ , for example a min@@ or, with hou@@ s@@ ing, f@@ ood, clo@@ th@@ ing, education and medical car@@ e, or with the means that are necessary for providing the person with these ess@@ enti@@ al@@ s.
This legal du@@ ty to maintain is called '@@ the du@@ ty to main@@ tain@@ ' or '@@ the du@@ ty to sup@@ port@@ '@@ .
Who must provide main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e?
The du@@ ty to maintain is based on bl@@ ood rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p, adop@@ tion, or the f@@ act that the parties are married to each oth@@ er.
A child must be sup@@ ported or main@@ tained by
his or her paren@@ ts, whether marri@@ ed, living toge@@ th@@ er, separ@@ ated or divor@@ c@@ ed, including parents who have adopted the child@@ ; and/or
his or her gr@@ and@@ paren@@ ts, whether or not the child's parents were married to each oth@@ er.
However, this v@@ aries from one case to an@@ oth@@ er.
The du@@ ty to support a family member is not li@@ mited to supporting a chil@@ d.
Any family m@@ em@@ ber@@ , ir@@ respective of his or her age@@ , can ask any family member to support or maintain him or her@@ , provided that the following two conditions are met@@ :
The family member who cla@@ ims support is unable to maintain hi@@ m@@ self or h@@ ers@@ elf@@ .
The family member from whom maintenance is cla@@ im@@ ed is able to af@@ ford the maintenance that is cla@@ i@@ me@@ d.
What exp@@ ens@@ es may be cla@@ i@@ me@@ d@@ ?
You may claim reasonable support that is necessary for providing the child or other person who has a right to maintenance with a pro@@ per living and up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing.
This includes providing nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties such as f@@ ood, clo@@ thing and hou@@ s@@ ing, as well as pay@@ ing for a pro@@ per educ@@ ation.
The court may also order the fa@@ ther to contribu@@ te to the payment of la@@ y@@ ing-@@ in exp@@ ens@@ es and maintenance from the date of the child's birth up to the date on which the maintenance order is gran@@ ted.
The court may also grant an order for the payment of medical exp@@ ens@@ es, or may order that the child be registered on the medical schem@@ e of one of the parties as a depend@@ an@@ t.
To en@@ able the court to grant a fair maintenance or@@ der, both parties must provide the court with proof of their exp@@ ens@@ es.
Your view of the other par@@ ent@@ 's be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our has no effect on your childr@@ en's right to main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e.
You still have to pay main@@ ten@@ ance, even if the other parent
re@@ marri@@ es
is involved in another rel@@ ation@@ ship
does not al@@ low you to see the children or
if either party later has more childr@@ en.
Your du@@ ty to pay maintenance and your right of access to your children are two enti@@ re@@ ly separ@@ ate matters and one has no rel@@ ation to the oth@@ er.
However, the amount of maintenance to be paid may be amended by the court if either of the parties should bring such an applic@@ ation.
Apply for maintenance at the mag@@ istr@@ ate@@ 's court in the district where you li@@ v@@ e.
If you are in d@@ ou@@ b@@ t, your local court will tel@@ l you at which court to apply for main@@ ten@@ anc@@ e.
G@@ o to the relevant court and complete and submit Form A@@ : Application for a maintenance or@@ der.
In addi@@ tion to the completed form@@ , submit proof of your month@@ ly income and exp@@ ens@@ es, such as recei@@ p@@ ts for food pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es, elec@@ tricity and/or r@@ ent bill pay@@ ments.
The court will set a date on which you and the respond@@ ent must go to the cour@@ t.
A maintenance officer and an investig@@ ator will investigate your claim and l@@ ook into your circum@@ st@@ anc@@ es.
The court will serve a sum@@ m@@ ons on the respond@@ ent to appe@@ ar in court on a specific date to disc@@ us@@ s the mat@@ ter.
The respond@@ ent then has a cho@@ ice between agree@@ ing to pay the maintenance as cla@@ i@@ me@@ d, or cont@@ esting the matter in cour@@ t.
If the respond@@ ent agre@@ es to pay the maintenance as cla@@ i@@ me@@ d, a mag@@ istr@@ ate will review the relevant docu@@ ment@@ ation.
H@@ e or she will then make an or@@ der, and may decide to do so without requi@@ ring the parties to appe@@ ar in cour@@ t.
If the person who is alle@@ ged@@ ly li@@ able to pay maintenance does not consent to the issu@@ ance of an or@@ der, he or she must appe@@ ar in cour@@ t, where evidence from both parties and their wit@@ nesses will be he@@ ar@@ d.
If the court fin@@ ds the person li@@ able for pay@@ ing main@@ ten@@ ance, it will make an order for the amount of maintenance to be pa@@ id@@ .
The court will also determine when and how maintenance pay@@ ments must be ma@@ de.
The court can order maintenance money to be paid in one of the following way@@ s:
At the local mag@@ istr@@ ate@@ 's office or any other government office designated for this purpose
In@@ to the bank or building soci@@ ety account designated by the person concerned
Direc@@ tly to the person who is entitled to the money
By means of an order that direc@@ ts the employer of the person who is li@@ able for pay@@ ing maintenance to de@@ duc@@ t the maintenance payment directly from the employ@@ ee@@ 's sal@@ ary, in accordance with the new Maintenance Act, 199@@ 8.
Maintenance Act, 1998 and related regulations
You will be treated equ@@ al@@ ly, h@@ um@@ an@@ ely and with di@@ gn@@ ity.
Complain@@ ts will be treated as qu@@ ick@@ ly and as eff@@ ici@@ ently as pos@@ si@@ ble.
There is no prescribed time fr@@ ame for this servic@@ e.
The enti@@ re proc@@ ess, from sub@@ mit@@ ting your application to recei@@ ving your first maintenance pay@@ ment, may take se@@ veral week@@ s, dep@@ ending on the coo@@ per@@ ation of both parti@@ es.
Wit@@ nesses who atten@@ d the proceed@@ ings, including the person who cla@@ ims main@@ ten@@ ance, are entitled to prescribed subsi@@ st@@ ence and travel@@ ling allo@@ wan@@ ces.
However, the court will decide at its own dis@@ cre@@ tion whether such an allow@@ ance will be paid to the person against whom a maintenance order may be ma@@ de.
The person who is cla@@ im@@ ing maintenance must apply to the maintenance officer for the payment of wit@@ ness fe@@ es.

Getting married under customary law
The C@@ ust@@ om@@ ary Mar@@ ri@@ ages Act bec@@ ame law on the 15 November 200@@ 0@@ .
If you were in an existing valid marriage under customary law before this d@@ ate, your marriage is recogn@@ ised under this new law@@ .
When a h@@ us@@ b@@ and already has more than one wi@@ f@@ e, all of those marri@@ ages are recogn@@ ised under this new law@@ .
This Act also recogn@@ is@@ es customary marri@@ ages enter@@ ed into after this date and st@@ ates the rules that the people ge@@ tting married under customary law must fol@@ low in order for their marriage to be recogn@@ is@@ ed.
A customary marriage is recogn@@ ised if people ge@@ tting married under customary law have comp@@ lied with the following require@@ ments@@ :
Bo@@ th parties to the marriage must be above the age of eigh@@ teen years.
Bo@@ th parties must consent to being married under customary law@@ .
Lo@@ b@@ ol@@ a is not a necessary require@@ ment for the vali@@ di@@ ty of the customary marri@@ age.
No@@ te that these marri@@ ages have al@@ ways been rec@@ ogni@@ z@@ ed under customary law@@ .
When should I register my marri@@ age@@ ?
If you were married under customary law before the 15@@ th November 200@@ 0, your marriage has to be registered with the Department of Home Af@@ fair@@ s.
If you were married after the law was pass@@ ed, you should register your marriage within three months after the marri@@ age.
C@@ ust@@ om@@ ary Mar@@ ri@@ ages and Community of Property
All customary marri@@ ages enter@@ ed into after the com@@ ing into operation of the Act are in community of proper@@ ty.
This means that the h@@ us@@ b@@ and and wi@@ fe have an equal share in the ass@@ et@@ s, money and property and also means that they share all the deb@@ ts.
If the parties would like their marriage to be out of community of property they will have to enter into an an@@ te-@@ n@@ up@@ tial contract pri@@ or to ge@@ tting marri@@ ed.
If they want to change after they are already married they will have to apply to the High Cour@@ t.
Un@@ der the C@@ ust@@ om@@ ary Mar@@ ri@@ ages Act the wi@@ fe has an equal right and status with the h@@ us@@ b@@ and to decide what happ@@ ens to the proper@@ ty.
A customary wi@@ fe now has the capacity to enter into a contract without the assistance of the h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ .
What if my h@@ us@@ b@@ and wan@@ ts to mar@@ ry another wi@@ fe@@ ?
The h@@ us@@ b@@ and must enter into a written agreement / contract which will state what should happ@@ en to the property and then the h@@ us@@ b@@ and must apply to the court to appro@@ ve the written contrac@@ t.
The court has to make sure that all the property interests of all wi@@ ves are protec@@ ted.
What if we want to enter into a civil marriage after marriage under customary law@@ ?
If your h@@ us@@ b@@ and has no other wi@@ v@@ es, you can get married under civil law as well as customary law@@ .
However, n@@ either of you will be able to enter into customary marri@@ ages with anyone el@@ se while you are married to each other under civil law@@ .
Ei@@ ther h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wi@@ fe can register the marriage at their nearest Department of Home Af@@ fair@@ s.
It is advis@@ able that both sp@@ ou@@ ses go together to register the marriage in order to make the registration go qu@@ ick@@ er.
