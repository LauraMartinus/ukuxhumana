G@@ row@@ ing the economy , and increasing investment in partnership with the private sector

H@@ on@@ our@@ able Premier and colleag@@ ues in the Executive 
This hope has been a common mess@@ age from our people whom we en@@ coun@@ tered during our peo@@ ples budget campaign this year . 
P@@ overty all@@ ev@@ iation and empow@@ erment - through broad@@ ening participation in the economy and n@@ ar@@ row@@ ing the g@@ ap between the first and second economy 
Provin@@ ce of 
the President h@@ im@@ self to set the following go@@ als for government at a national level@@ : 
do not have a represent@@ ational process . As a result , most of them are under@@ cap@@ it@@ alised , in the same way that a firm is under@@ cap@@ it@@ alised when it issues f@@ ew@@ er sec@@ ur@@ ities than its income and assets would jus@@ tify . 
The enterprises of the poor are very much like cor@@ por@@ ations that cannot issue shar@@ es or b@@ ond@@ s to obtain new invest@@ ments and fin@@ ance . W@@ ith@@ out represent@@ ations , their assets are de@@ ad capital . 
This is the m@@ yst@@ ery of capital 6 / 2 0 0 7 B U D G E T S P E E C H 
In the next five years the government will inv@@ est nationally more than R@@ 4@@ 00 billion in infrastructure to create j@@ obs and fight poverty . 
In cr@@ af@@ ting the budget pro@@ pos@@ als , we went to great leng@@ th@@ s to l@@ ist@@ en to the vo@@ ices of the people across the province , particularly the poor , dis@@ empow@@ ered , j@@ ob@@ less and hom@@ el@@ ess .

The poor in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants of these n@@ ations the over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing majority do have things , but they lack the process to re@@ present their property and create capital .

These invest@@ ments and interventions will occ@@ ur under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of the Ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated and Sh@@ ar@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative of South Africa , the over@@ all go@@ al being to hal@@ ve poverty and un@@ employment by 20@@ 14 . 
Deputy Speaker 
But we were pro@@ ud to anno@@ un@@ ce that the jour@@ ney had beg@@ un@@ ! This year the jour@@ ney to pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity for all in the province continues . There will be no change in direc@@ tion or our end dest@@ ination . 
In op@@ ening the National Parliament in 200@@ 5 , President Mb@@ eki said , our country , as a un@@ ited nation , has never in its enti@@ re history enj@@ oy@@ ed such a confl@@ u@@ ence of encour@@ ag@@ ing possib@@ ilities .

In t@@ abl@@ ing the provincial budget for 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 in Mar@@ ch last year , we announc@@ ed a com@@ prehensive plan to trans@@ form the regional economy . This would be achieved through three main inter@@ v@@ enti@@ ons@@ :

This province will not lag behind in achiev@@ ing these national develop@@ mental go@@ als . Th@@ us in this years budget there is an increase in funding for all vot@@ es , including that of basic services and infrastructure provision . 
The provincial government has achieved positive results in its efforts to gro@@ w the economy and to achieve sus@@ tain@@ ably high@@ er growth rates , in partnership with the private sector .

The main changes to the budget for the next three years are@@ :

National B@@ ud@@ get@@ ? 
South Afric@@ as economy will be affected by this s@@ low@@ down , but our economy has a strong fo@@ und@@ ation , the public fin@@ ances are sound , investment is r@@ ising and the long-@@ term out@@ look for growth is heal@@ thy . We will we@@ ather the stor@@ m .

A 7@@ 50 m@@ l bot@@ tle of w@@ ine will cost 9 c@@ ents more 
Many other government programmes support vul@@ ner@@ able hous@@ ehol@@ ds . Ch@@ ild@@ ren who receive social assistance do not have to pay school fees . 
but is still heal@@ thy growth for a country such as South Africa . And most import@@ antly , we will continue to inv@@ est for the future . 
B@@ ec@@ ause of these constraints and because of the we@@ aker global environment , our economy is lik@@ ely to s@@ low down , growing at about 4 to 4 a year for the next three years . 
Con@@ struc@@ tion of a p@@ um@@ p stor@@ age project , Ing@@ ula , in nor@@ thern KwaZulu-Natal . Ing@@ ula will gener@@ ate 3@@ 3@@ 1 M@@ W of electricity by 20@@ 12 and an additional 9@@ 9@@ 3 M@@ W by 20@@ 1@@ 3 .

Our economy has experi@@ enced its long@@ est period of economic exp@@ an@@ sion in over 50 years , growing by an av@@ er@@ age of 5 per cent a year for the last five years . Sin@@ ce 200@@ 1 , we have created about 1 .@@ 5 mil@@ lion j@@ obs . 
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term capacity exp@@ an@@ sion includ@@ es:

Social grant increas@@ es and extension of our grant system 
T@@ ot@@ al tax rel@@ ief for individuals of R@@ 7 .@@ 7 billion 
We are planning health and dis@@ aster management , event operations , safety and security , volun@@ te@@ er training and recru@@ it@@ ment , environmental rehabilitation and waste management , event communic@@ ation , leg@@ acy and cultural activities . 
R@@ 12 billion more for social gr@@ ants 
As a result , we have been able to provide more resources for education , health , social gr@@ ants , housing , policing , public transport , stadi@@ ums , roads and pris@@ ons . 
R@@ 7 .@@ 6 billion more for public transport , roads and r@@ ail@@ way infrastructure 
In addition , a total of R@@ 9 billion is allocated to public transport projects related to the World Cup . 
The 200@@ 8 B@@ ud@@ get also makes provision to ph@@ ase in a reduc@@ tion of the age of elig@@ ib@@ ility for men from 6@@ 5 to 60 years - which is the same for women . 
T@@ ogether with reduc@@ ed capacity when plants are sh@@ ut down for regular maintenance , this means that E@@ sk@@ om is not able to gener@@ ate en@@ ough electricity to meet dem@@ and by hous@@ ehol@@ ds and industry . This results in power c@@ u@@ ts . 
In 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 , total sp@@ ending on gr@@ ants will increase to R@@ 6@@ 9 billion , which is 10 of total government sp@@ ending .

It des@@ crib@@ es how government will ra@@ ise money and how it will be sp@@ ent . The national budget div@@ ides money between national departments , provinces and municipalities . 
The old age p@@ ension is one of main the p@@ ill@@ ars of our gr@@ ants system . 
such as old age and child@@ h@@ ood , or if they are dis@@ abled and cannot work . The available gr@@ ants are the old age p@@ ension , the dis@@ ability grant , the child support grant , the fos@@ ter care grant and the care dep@@ end@@ ency grant . 
A reduc@@ tion in the cor@@ por@@ ate income tax rate to 2@@ 8 per cent 
We are also taking steps to make government work better for the people , and to get more value for each r@@ and sp@@ ent . 
increase the number of pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors and m@@ agistr@@ ates , exp@@ and the capacity of pris@@ ons , encour@@ age people to s@@ ave electricity , and bo@@ ost our trade and ex@@ ports .

As the economy has grow@@ n , we have come up against some lim@@ it@@ ations . The short@@ age of sk@@ illed people , in@@ sufficient electricity , 
This is s@@ lower than the past five years , 
traffic con@@ g@@ es@@ tion and c@@ ement short@@ ages are all sig@@ ns that the economy is re@@ aching its spe@@ ed lim@@ it . To gro@@ w f@@ aster , we have to inv@@ est even more in skills , in infrastructure , in mach@@ in@@ ery and equipment , in roads and public transport .

Con@@ struc@@ tion of two g@@ as@@ -@@ fired power plants - open cy@@ c@@ le gas tur@@ b@@ ines in M@@ os@@ sel Bay and A@@ tl@@ anti@@ s . These will provide an additional M@@ W . 
The fo@@ und@@ ation of our economy is strong and will be t@@ ested over the next year or two . With the right policies and hard work from all South Africans , 
R@@ 5 billion in tax subsid@@ ies set as@@ ide over the next five years to support invest@@ ments in labour int@@ ensive indus@@ tries and to support governments industrial policy 
In Febru@@ ary of each year , the Minister of Fin@@ ance anno@@ un@@ ces governments sp@@ ending , tax and b@@ or@@ row@@ ing plans for the next three years . This is called the national budget . 
B@@ ec@@ ause of rap@@ id economic growth and proper management of the public fin@@ ances , government sp@@ ending has grow@@ n rap@@ idl@@ y since 200@@ 1 , much f@@ aster than economic growth . 
A p@@ ack@@ et of 20 c@@ ig@@ ar@@ et@@ tes will cost 6@@ 6 c@@ ents more 
L@@ ong@@ -@@ term capacity exp@@ an@@ sion includ@@ es: 
H@@ ost ci@@ ties will also receive funding of R@@ 6@@ 8@@ 4 mil@@ lion to conduct operations during the 200@@ 9 Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations Cup and 20@@ 10 F@@ IF@@ A World Cup . 
This makes South Africa one of the wor@@ l@@ ds b@@ igg@@ est sp@@ end@@ ers on social gr@@ ants . 
All children under the age of 6 are entitled to free primary health care . All benefici@@ aries of social gr@@ ants who are not members of private medical aid sch@@ em@@ es are fully sub@@ si@@ dis@@ ed to receive health services at public hos@@ pit@@ als . 
Th@@ roug@@ h get@@ ting better results from public sp@@ ending and through high@@ er levels of investment , we can lif@@ t our economy towards a growth rate of 6 . 
F@@ u@@ el tax@@ es will increase , as from 2 A@@ pr@@ il 200@@ 8 , by 11 c@@ ents per lit@@ re 
E@@ sk@@ om has 2@@ 6 power stations with the capacity to gener@@ ate 3@@ 7 7@@ 6@@ 1 m@@ eg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity in total . However , only 3@@ 5 4@@ 36 M@@ W is normally available , with M@@ W used ex@@ clus@@ iv@@ ely during pe@@ ak times .

we can gro@@ w even f@@ aster and make a b@@ igg@@ er differ@@ ence to the lives of all of our people . 
T@@ ogether , these invest@@ ments will increase South Afric@@ as long-@@ term capacity to provide power to hom@@ es and businesses . However , the electricity cr@@ is@@ is also shows the need for all of us to cons@@ erve electricity and use it more effici@@ ently .
