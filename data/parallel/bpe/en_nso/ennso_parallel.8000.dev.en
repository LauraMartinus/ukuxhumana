ï»¿@@ But we should not take this for granted . 
within the contex@@ t of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership Agre@@ ement are completed as soon as possible , 
As the Hon@@ our@@ able Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; 
A critical ste@@ p in this regard is the consolid@@ ation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achiev@@ ing regional integration . 
It is in this contex@@ t , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multi@@ lat@@ eral inter@@ actions with our neigh@@ b@@ ours and the Europ@@ ean Union , 
With all hand@@ s on dec@@ k , and committed to conduct our business in an un@@ usu@@ al and more effective fas@@ hi@@ on , 
A@@ mong the key proposed interven@@ tions are : expan@@ ding the public works programme , employment subsi@@ dies for direct job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation for target@@ ed groups , 
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special atten@@ tion during this year , and ensure that we meet the targ@@ ets we have set our@@ selves . 
and business to identify the interven@@ tions required in specific house@@ holds and imple@@ ment them as a matter of urg@@ ency . 
Cri@@ tical in this regard , is the strength@@ ening of co@@ operation between the UN Security Council and the Pe@@ ace and Security Council of the African Union . 
F@@ ur@@ ther , after correc@@ ting we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in our A@@ dul@@ t Ba@@ sic Education programme , which we identified last year , 
to stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of our being â to respon@@ d to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , 
and Development is a strategic relationship of mut@@ ual benefit , which can only g@@ row from streng@@ th to streng@@ th . 
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulner@@ able sectors such as v@@ eter@@ ans , women and youth , we shall review the structures deleg@@ ated to carry out these functions 
But we will all ag@@ ree that our society , and the poor specific@@ ally , cannot wa@@ it for strateg@@ ies 
to enh@@ ance governments capacity to put in place re@@ alis@@ tic and integrated plans , cover@@ ing all s@@ pher@@ es of government . 
inten@@ si@@ fying efforts already started to scale up assistance to co@@ oper@@ atives and small enterpri@@ ses especially those invol@@ ving women , 
and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . 
premi@@ sed on ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the development of our region . 
As requested by the SADC Head@@ s of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negoti@@ ations . 
and our continu@@ ing adv@@ ance towards the cre@@ ation of a society that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to ga@@ ther in our country to celeb@@ rate Afric@@ as human@@ ity in 2@@ 0@@ 10 . 
as the reduc@@ tion of un@@ employment and adv@@ ancing the go@@ al of health for all . 
we shall this month launch the Kh@@ a R@@ i G@@ ude mas@@ s liter@@ acy campaign . 
There are si@@ mp@@ le but urg@@ ent and critical prior@@ ities we will attend to , as part of the overall effor@@ t to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
and hope to use our Chair@@ person@@ ship of SADC in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 200@@ 9 further to give imp@@ et@@ us to the regional en@@ de@@ av@@ ours in this regard . 
introduc@@ ing the system of products for prefer@@ ential pro@@ cu@@ rement by government from small , medi@@ um and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses ; 
we shall susta@@ in the process of our re@@ construction and development and take it to even higher levels . 
br@@ ing@@ ing together the judi@@ ci@@ ary and magi@@ str@@ acy , 
I am confi@@ dent that , under the lead@@ ership of the International Mar@@ keting Council , Trade and Inv@@ est@@ ment South Africa , Tourism South Africa 
If any@@ thing , the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al should apply to all individu@@ als who carry the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being public serv@@ ants . 
These global responsib@@ ilities , including the ho@@ sting of the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up , 
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person , When we reflec@@ ted on the issue of crime at last years Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament , 
Two such issues des@@ er@@ ve bri@@ ef men@@ tion . 
The first of these is a propos@@ al that we should develop an o@@ ath that will be rec@@ ited by learners in their mor@@ ning school as@@ sem@@ bli@@ es , 
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the B@@ ills on the transformation of the judi@@ ci@@ ary in consultation with judg@@ es and magi@@ str@@ ates , complete the strategy aimed at strength@@ ening bor@@ der control 
I@@ mp@@ el@@ led by the des@@ ire to promote the improv@@ ement in the quality of life of all peop@@ les , particularly in the developing countries , 
Fir@@ stly , it has been agreed across all s@@ pher@@ es of government that especially the critical vac@@ an@@ cies should be fil@@ led within six months of such op@@ en@@ ings emerg@@ ing . 
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and elec@@ tor@@ al laws , and other matters that have been in con@@ ten@@ tion for many years . 
and security , further give life to the V@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms Char@@ ter , pay particular atten@@ tion to the issue of repe@@ at off@@ end@@ ers , and continue the implementation of additional measures der@@ i@@ ving from recommend@@ ations of the Tr@@ ut@@ h and Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ation Commission . 
These are : 
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector uni@@ ons , we will con@@ v@@ ene a Public Sec@@ tor Summit to th@@ ras@@ h out these issues 
and other ag@@ encies we shall all put our hand@@ s on dec@@ k to communic@@ ate to the rest of the world the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , 
and other deci@@ sive measures required further to enh@@ ance our capacity to fight organised crime . 
and access by all house@@ holds to these services . 
we all expres@@ sed gra@@ ve concern not only at the high rates of crime , 
F@@ ur@@ ther , it is critical to enh@@ ance the commitment of public employees to their du@@ ties â a task that bel@@ ong@@ s to the lead@@ ership , the public serv@@ ants themselves and the trade uni@@ on movement . 
In the programme to provide sustainable human settle@@ ments , we are now able to provide 2@@ 6@@ 0 00@@ 0 housing un@@ its per ann@@ um , 
Ab@@ out R@@ 1 bil@@ li@@ on over the ba@@ sel@@ ine will be allocated to programmes that fall within the E@@ P@@ W@@ P ; 
develop@@ ments that clear@@ ly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the reg@@ ener@@ ation of the African continent . 
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified der@@ i@@ ve from serious we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in terms of our planning . 
but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and comple@@ ment@@ ary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime . 
and exam@@ ine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specific@@ ally established to focus on youth development and em@@ power@@ ment . 
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , bene@@ fi@@ ting from the consult@@ ations that have started with social partners . 
and improv@@ ing the capital base and re@@ ach of the Mic@@ ro-@@ Agricul@@ tural Fin@@ ance In@@ stitu@@ tions of South Africa to provide mic@@ ro-@@ credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentr@@ ations of farm d@@ well@@ ers 
Al@@ ong with the progress we are making in the variety of interven@@ tions foc@@ used on poverty reduc@@ tion , we continue to address a number many we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses , 
We are confi@@ dent that , informed by their ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ence of the sc@@ our@@ ge of rac@@ ism and the de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating consequ@@ ences it continues to ex@@ act on human@@ ity , the governments and peop@@ les of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Re@@ view Confer@@ ence achiev@@ es its objectives . 
Y@@ et another critical A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ ority is the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of an integrated and comprehensive anti-@@ poverty strategy that addres@@ ses especially sections of the population most affected by this sc@@ our@@ ge . 
O@@ ver the past year , we carried out the man@@ date of SADC to assist the political lead@@ ership of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to the political challenges they face . 
We had an opportunity , on the fr@@ ing@@ es of the AU Summit in Ad@@ di@@ s A@@ ba@@ ba for@@ mally to present a comprehensive report to the lead@@ ership of SADC on this matter . 
We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , tra@@ in over 3 00@@ 0 health personnel in the management of this disease 
and on@@ going improv@@ ements in this regard , and in giving further imp@@ et@@ us to the negoti@@ ations on the W@@ T@@ O Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound . 
Our government will remain se@@ ized of the processes under way in K@@ enya , C@@ had , Bur@@ un@@ di , Dar@@ fu@@ r in the Sud@@ an , Western Sa@@ h@@ ara ,

The programme that we have ou@@ tl@@ ined incorpor@@ ates the commit@@ ments that our country has agreed with the lead@@ ership of the continent through the African Pe@@ er Re@@ view M@@ echan@@ ism . 
As such , in the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , government int@@ ends this year to inten@@ si@@ fy the campaign to identify specific house@@ holds

with empha@@ sis on providing training and market@@ s , including lin@@ king them up with established ou@@ tle@@ ts ; 
As we put all our hand@@ s on dec@@ k and ge@@ ar our@@ selves for Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al we should also inten@@ si@@ fy national di@@ alogu@@ e on the issues that defin@@ e us as a n@@ ation . 
What is outstanding , ho@@ we@@ ver , is a proced@@ ural matter relating to the tim@@ ing and the manner of en@@ ac@@ t@@ ment of the new agreed D@@ ra@@ ft Constitution .

respect for our judi@@ ci@@ ary and pursu@@ it of equ@@ al human rights , which our Constitution enjo@@ ins us to ob@@ serve in our da@@ ily lives and pr@@ on@@ ounc@@ ements . 
We are particularly concerned by the sen@@ sel@@ ess violence and k@@ ill@@ ings in both K@@ enya and C@@ had , 
What will continue to inform us as we take this ste@@ p will be the ab@@ sol@@ ute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , 
the N@@ on-@@ A@@ li@@ gn@@ ed Mo@@ vement , the Grou@@ p of 7@@ 7 and negoti@@ ations to complete the SA@@ C@@ U@@ -@@ Mer@@ cus@@ or trade agreement . 
This includes improv@@ ing the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ o@@ ting out cor@@ rup@@ t el@@ ements and p@@ il@@ o@@ ting the new ID car@@ d . 
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consider@@ ation whether their success is hel@@ ping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , 
and through the S@@ mal@@ l En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses Development Ag@@ ency setting up a ri@@ gor@@ ous system to ensure that the 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day payment period is ob@@ served . 
I say this with un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able con@@ vic@@ tion because I am certain that South Africans are cap@@ able and ge@@ ar@@ ed to meet the challenge of history â 
We shall this year attend to other specific prior@@ ities which are critical to the countr@@ ys wa@@ r against poverty , in pursu@@ it of soci@@ o@@ economic inclu@@ sion .

ï»¿@@ In this regard , we are hear@@ ten@@ ed by the resol@@ ve sh@@ own by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime .
Many of the we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in improv@@ ing services to the population der@@ i@@ ve in part from in@@ adequ@@ ate capacity and systems to monitor implementation .
For us it is not a m@@ ere c@@ lic@@ h@@ Ã@@ © to as@@ ser@@ t that the success of our democracy should and will be measu@@ red by the con@@ cre@@ te step@@ s we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulner@@ able in our society .

We should d@@ are to act in concer@@ t to pursu@@ e the happ@@ iness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free .

At the same time , we shall urg@@ ently resol@@ ve the issue of responsib@@ ilities between the national and provincial s@@ pher@@ es in the management of the F@@ ET system .
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to dis@@ charge the responsibility to protect our citizens .

We are pr@@ ou@@ d , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in hel@@ ping to bring this about â from the young men and women in our National Def@@ ence For@@ ce to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dre@@ am fin@@ ds practic@@ al re@@ alisation in the hom@@ el@@ and of P@@ at@@ ric@@ e L@@ um@@ um@@ ba .
We h@@ ere@@ by wish to ple@@ dge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most est@@ e@@ emed of multi@@ lat@@ eral bodi@@ es , do every@@ thing necessary further to contribute to international peace and security .
What has emerg@@ ed , among others , as a critical area for strategic inter@@ vention is the content of training that public serv@@ ants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development In@@ stitute which in ac@@ tual fact should be the major service provi@@ der including in the mas@@ s in@@ duc@@ tion of public serv@@ ants .
S@@ ince the popul@@ ar man@@ date of 200@@ 4 , we have made welcome progress in further chang@@ ing South Africa for the better .
With regard to min@@ eral benef@@ ici@@ ation for inst@@ ance , we will set up a State Di@@ am@@ ond Tra@@ der that will purcha@@ se 10 of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds from local produc@@ ers and sel@@ l them to local cut@@ ters and produc@@ ers .
It is encour@@ aging that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the recent period , been within manag@@ e@@ able rang@@ es , as the programmes re@@ ach mat@@ urity .
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of these public serv@@ ants have prov@@ en over and over again in ac@@ tual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ e even the little quality time they could have with their famil@@ ies , in defence of our freedom and our security .
continue with the processes further to capac@@ it@@ ate our intelligence ag@@ encies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ;
F@@ ur@@ ther to improve its service to the people , government should op@@ ti@@ mi@@ se its capacity and organis@@ ational effici@@ ency .

To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year :

Ob@@ vi@@ ously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correc@@ t ob@@ servation that audi@@ ting requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent .
develop an over@@ ar@@ ching strategy to prior@@ iti@@ se key interven@@ tions in mining and min@@ eral benef@@ ici@@ ation , agricul@@ ture and ag@@ ro-@@ processing , the white goods sector , cre@@ ative industri@@ es , community and social services and phar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als .

complete , within the next 1@@ 8 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant nor@@ ms and standards , re@@ mun@@ eration policy and matters per@@ taining to medical a@@ id and pen@@ sions ;
What we should under@@ line though is that in fin@@ ishing the new social security disp@@ ens@@ ation , government will under@@ take a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individu@@ ally and through NE@@ D@@ L@@ A@@ C .
Com@@ pli@@ ance levels within departments , in rel@@ ation to public service and fin@@ ance management legislation , have been some@@ what mi@@ xed .
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is cru@@ cial .
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vac@@ an@@ cies remain or have emerg@@ ed in senior management and the profes@@ sions .

In this regard , we must respon@@ d to the col@@ d re@@ ality that , as in other countries , the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of viol@@ ent cri@@ mes against the person oc@@ cu@@ r in the most socio-@@ econom@@ ically de@@ pri@@ ved areas of our country and require strong and susta@@ ined community interven@@ tions foc@@ used on crime prevention .
The special rate will be directly compar@@ able to those for the same service and capacity per month offer@@ ed in any of the compar@@ able countries .
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to co@@ operate fully in these important under@@ tak@@ ings .
in line with the National Indu@@ stri@@ al Polic@@ y Fr@@ ame@@ work which has now been completed , we will :
This will la@@ y the basis for co@@ operation among all social partners in spe@@ eding up local economic development .
In addition to the many on@@ going programmes that we have been implemen@@ ting , government will this year :
This must include a determined dri@@ ve to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods .
And so , let us rol@@ l up our s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we year@@ n is a common responsibility we all share .
process the Com@@ pan@@ ies Bill , adopted for public com@@ ment by Cabinet last W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , as part of the bat@@ ter@@ y of measures to reduce the regul@@ atory bur@@ den on small , medi@@ um and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses and to em@@ power min@@ ority sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders and employees ;
spe@@ eding up of the construction of low@@ -@@ cost housing which will require the urg@@ ent establishment of a Spec@@ ial P@@ ur@@ pose V@@ e@@ hic@@ le to hand@@ le fin@@ ances , p@@ il@@ o@@ ting of the Land U@@ se Management Bill and ensuring that the re@@ ma@@ ining el@@ ements of the mu@@ ch@@ -@@ del@@ a@@ yed agreement with the private sector on low@@ -@@ cost housing are fin@@ alised ;
B@@ ec@@ ause of this , during the course of this year , we will among other th@@ ings :
further capac@@ it@@ ate and provide more support to the institution of traditional lead@@ ership .
We continue to respon@@ d to these challenges and will under@@ take all necessary t@@ as@@ ks , informed by our Fi@@ ve Y@@ e@@ ar Local Government Str@@ ateg@@ ic Ag@@ end@@ a , which includes hand@@ s-@@ on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , the deploy@@ ment of sk@@ illed personnel including professional volun@@ te@@ ers from the public , and strength@@ ening the W@@ ard Commit@@ tees â 8@@ 0 of which have been established across the country .
In this regard , government comm@@ its itself to inten@@ si@@ fy the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all el@@ ements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , hom@@ e-@@ based care and treatment .
This is that the contribut@@ ory ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related p@@ il@@ la@@ r of our social security system is mis@@ sing or un@@ reli@@ able for large numbers of working people .
imple@@ ment the programmes dec@@ ided upon to build more correc@@ tions facilities and re@@ alise the objectives of the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on Cor@@ rec@@ tions ;
and in Mpumal@@ anga only 1 of senior manag@@ ers had conclud@@ ed Ke@@ y Per@@ forman@@ ce Agre@@ ements .
We are con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that solu@@ tions to the log@@ j@@ am@@ s currently being experi@@ enced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries ali@@ ke that these tal@@ ks should re@@ ach fru@@ ition .
develop programmes to facilitate invest@@ ments in sectors along the supply cha@@ in for our infrastructure programmes , including capital goods in IC@@ T , transport and energy : with regard to energy , we will also ex@@ pedi@@ te our work to ensure greater reli@@ ance on nuclear power gener@@ ation , natural gas and the various forms of renew@@ able sour@@ ces of energy .
In car@@ r@@ ying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA World C@@ up is the best ever .
continu@@ ing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural cau@@ ses of death in our society as well as li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le disea@@ ses , mal@@ ari@@ a , the various stra@@ ins of TB , road ac@@ cid@@ ents and viol@@ ent crime .
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improv@@ ing the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the public , in which hu@@ ge resources are exp@@ ended , are actually me@@ t .
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted dri@@ ve in which all of South Africa should eng@@ age in order to reduce the levels of poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality in our society .
Qu@@ ite clear@@ ly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjo@@ y the happ@@ iness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an inten@@ si@@ fied programme to address challenges in the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y .
I should men@@ tion in this regard that the Min@@ istr@@ y of S@@ af@@ ety and Security and the Police Service are working on propos@@ als further to improve the function@@ ing and effec@@ tiveness of the v@@ it@@ ally important Community Police For@@ ums .
Hon@@ our@@ able Members ;
In the discussions thu@@ s far conducted within government , con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is emerg@@ ing that el@@ ements of this system would need to include :
fin@@ alise re@@ ma@@ ining el@@ ements of measures to trans@@ form the judi@@ ci@@ ary and improve its function@@ ing , in consultation with this em@@ in@@ ent institution of our democracy ;
Our government will respon@@ d appropri@@ ately and as our capacity per@@ mits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Som@@ ali@@ a .
J@@ ust over a month ago , South Africa started its t@@ our of duty as a non-@@ permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
We should today , even more confi@@ den@@ tly , spe@@ ak together of freedom .
The progress we have made with regard to the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of F@@ ur@@ ther Education and Tra@@ ining Col@@ leg@@ es has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibility for us signific@@ an@@ tly to exp@@ and the number of available ar@@ tis@@ ans .
ensuring the implementation , without further del@@ ay , of measures to reduce the cost of medic@@ ines ;
imple@@ ment the recommend@@ ations of the Kha@@ m@@ pe@@ pe Commission on the man@@ date and operations of the Director@@ ate of Spec@@ ial Oper@@ ations ;
In this regard , two major surve@@ ys will be under@@ taken in 200@@ 7 .
We highly appreci@@ ate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service manag@@ ers , across the three s@@ pher@@ es of government , in leading this process and in implemen@@ ting the government programme as a whole .
conduct capacity assess@@ ments and imple@@ ment interven@@ tions in Provincial Depart@@ ments responsible for local government , as well as the Offic@@ es of the Premi@@ ers , while continu@@ ing to improve the capacity of our national departments ;
These 30 00@@ 0 individu@@ als will be trac@@ ked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as mig@@ ration , labour market tran@@ si@@ tions , inter-@@ gener@@ ational mob@@ ility and household formation and dis@@ sol@@ ution .
Cri@@ tical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the prot@@ ag@@ on@@ ists within Som@@ ali@@ a inter@@ act with one another to find a sol@@ ution that is inclu@@ sive and practic@@ able , based on the need to achieve national recon@@ cili@@ ation .
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help sen@@ d the mess@@ age especially to our young people , that ar@@ tis@@ an skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of quali@@ fication .
Im@@ prov@@ ing govern@@ ance also means having a sound statistical data@@ base about social dy@@ nam@@ ics within our n@@ ation .
As we have already said , these and other measures will suc@@ ce@@ ed only if we build an end@@ uring partnership in ac@@ tual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the crimin@@ als .
The princip@@ le gu@@ i@@ ding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government bud@@ get , we need to expl@@ ore the introduc@@ tion of an ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related contribut@@ ory social security system that is informed by the princip@@ le of social solid@@ ar@@ ity .
We should not and do not under@@ play the many difficul@@ ties we still con@@ front .
The challenge that we face in addres@@ sing this issue has little to do with policies .
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er , Chair@@ person and Hon@@ our@@ able Members ;
Sim@@ il@@ arly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to spe@@ ed up the implementation of the NEPA@@ D programmes .
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person ;@@ Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person :
Ho@@ we@@ ver , while we are fully jus@@ tified in celeb@@ r@@ ating the achiev@@ ements that Africa has made in her en@@ de@@ av@@ our to achieve peace and development , we cannot under@@ play the challenges that we face in dealing with the re@@ ma@@ ining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sud@@ an , including the situation in Dar@@ fu@@ r , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire and Som@@ ali@@ a .
One of the critical questions that we shall pursu@@ e in this regard is the spe@@ ed@@ y re@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of the Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound of W@@ T@@ O negoti@@ ations .
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , we aim this year to complete the work already started to re@@ form our system of social security so that pha@@ sed implementation can start as early as possible .
complete the process of re@@ view@@ ing the countr@@ ys experience in the ar@@ ticul@@ ation among such mac@@ ro-@@ economic indic@@ ators as the Ex@@ change R@@ ate , inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industri@@ es which produce tra@@ d@@ ables for both the dom@@ estic and export market@@ s , and have the potential to ab@@ sor@@ b large po@@ ol@@ s of se@@ mi@@ -@@ sk@@ illed workers ;
We will also take a variety of step@@ s to improve competi@@ tion in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practic@@ al introduc@@ tion of the Reg@@ ul@@ atory I@@ mp@@ act As@@ ses@@ s@@ ment system , developing high-@@ spe@@ ed national and international broad@@ band capacity , fin@@ alising the plan to improve the capacity of the ra@@ il and port oper@@ ators , and strength@@ ening the effec@@ tiveness of our competi@@ tion authorities .
in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Provin@@ ce , the vac@@ ancy rate at senior management level was over 50 ;
The programme to al@@ ign planning instru@@ ments across the s@@ pher@@ es of government is continu@@ ing , with p@@ il@@ ot projects for complete al@@ ign@@ ment being run in 1@@ 3 of our di@@ stric@@ ts and met@@ ro@@ s .
We must act to change this situation .
But the mess@@ age that our collec@@ tive experience communic@@ ates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall suc@@ ce@@ ed in meeting the common objective we have set our@@ selves as a n@@ ation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and re@@ present much that is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society .
It is a matter of pr@@ ou@@ d record that over half of the di@@ stric@@ ts and met@@ ro@@ s have held their G@@ row@@ th and Development Sum@@ mits , and the rest inten@@ d to complete this process by the end of F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after the Mar@@ ch 200@@ 6 local government elec@@ tions , in@@ duc@@ tion programmes were conducted , taking into account that 6@@ 2 of the ma@@ y@@ ors are new .
This is central to our efforts to er@@ ase that which is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in our society so that we can spe@@ ak of freedom and the happ@@ iness that comes with liber@@ ty .
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strength@@ ening our fight against crime are effec@@ tively implemented .
while inten@@ si@@ fying the public sector and national an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effec@@ tiveness of our an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption strateg@@ ies for all s@@ pher@@ es of government ;
But no one , except our@@ selves , shall ensure that this dre@@ am is re@@ alised .
This will mean that all South Africans will enjo@@ y memb@@ ership of a common , administr@@ atively efficient social in@@ sur@@ ance system , while those ear@@ ning higher in@@ comes will be able to continue contri@@ bu@@ ting to private reti@@ rement and in@@ sur@@ ance sch@@ em@@ es .
For inst@@ ance , in Sep@@ t@@ ember last year , 2@@ 7 of municipalities did not have municipal manag@@ ers ;
inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach and awareness on issues of national spati@@ al development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the har@@ mon@@ isation of planning instru@@ ments across the three s@@ pher@@ es ;
A@@ mong the gre@@ at@@ est achiev@@ ements of the peop@@ les of Africa in the past tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ half years has been the rest@@ or@@ ation of peace in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es Regi@@ on .
We shall also fin@@ alise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on , including the comprehensive and integrated anti-@@ poverty strategy we have mentioned , as well as address issues per@@ taining to national unity , value systems and identity .
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislat@@ ors , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challeng@@ ing as it was uni@@ que for our young democracy .
ï»¿@@ Two such issues des@@ er@@ ve bri@@ ef men@@ tion .
Our government will remain se@@ ized of the processes under way in K@@ enya , C@@ had , Bur@@ un@@ di , Dar@@ fu@@ r in the Sud@@ an , Western Sa@@ h@@ ara , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , Som@@ ali@@ a , the Com@@ oro@@ s and the Central African Republic to find las@@ ting peace and st@@ ability .
We shall this year attend to other specific prior@@ ities which are critical to the countr@@ ys wa@@ r against poverty , in pursu@@ it of soci@@ o@@ economic inclu@@ sion .
I thank her for taking the tr@@ ou@@ ble to be with us today , and tr@@ ust that we will not dis@@ appoint her .
the further ac@@ cel@@ eration of our economic growth and development
As such , in the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , government int@@ ends this year to inten@@ si@@ fy the campaign to identify specific house@@ holds and individu@@ als in dire need and to put in place interven@@ tions that will help , in the interven@@ ing period , to alle@@ vi@@ ate their pl@@ ight in those individual house@@ holds .
I@@ mp@@ el@@ led by the des@@ ire to promote the improv@@ ement in the quality of life of all peop@@ les , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strength@@ ening our participation in the Indi@@ a-@@ B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ -@@ South Africa for@@ ums , the New Afric@@ a-@@ A@@ sia Str@@ ateg@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership , the N@@ on-@@ A@@ li@@ gn@@ ed Mo@@ vement , the Grou@@ p of 7@@ 7 and negoti@@ ations to complete the SA@@ C@@ U@@ -@@ Mer@@ cus@@ or trade agreement .
I am certain that the South African Fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all Associ@@ ation , our co@@ ach@@ es led by Car@@ lo@@ s Al@@ ber@@ to Par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , and the players are aware of the heav@@ y responsibility they carry to pre@@ p@@ are a national team of which both we and Africa should be pr@@ ou@@ d .
We are particularly concerned by the sen@@ sel@@ ess violence and k@@ ill@@ ings in both K@@ enya and C@@ had , develop@@ ments that clear@@ ly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the reg@@ ener@@ ation of the African continent .
My answ@@ er to this question is a defin@@ ite No !
In this regard , I would like to expres@@ s our appreci@@ ation and full agreement with the com@@ ments made by the Chief Executive of Ang@@ lo Americ@@ an , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Car@@ rol@@ l , when she addres@@ sed the Min@@ ing In@@ da@@ ba here in Cape Town earli@@ er this week , on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 5 .
What I do know and h@@ ere@@ by make bol@@ d to say is : wh@@ at@@ ever the challenges of the mom@@ ent , we are still on course !
Li@@ ke the rest of our Government I am con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that the fundament@@ als that have informed our countr@@ ys forward mar@@ ch in the last 14 years remain in place .
An el@@ ement of governments A@@ pe@@ x of Pri@@ or@@ ities will be del@@ iber@@ ate focus on matters of skills development .
We shall continue this year to inten@@ si@@ fy efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5@@ -@@ year Local Government Str@@ ateg@@ ic Ag@@ end@@ a .
In essen@@ ce the significant ri@@ se in electricity dem@@ and over the last two years has out@@ stri@@ p@@ ped the new capacity we have brought on stre@@ am .
the B@@ ud@@ get will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equ@@ alising the age of el@@ ig@@ ib@@ ility at 6@@ 0 , thu@@ s bene@@ fi@@ ting about half a milli@@ on men ;
Ho@@ we@@ ver , like all the Hon@@ our@@ able Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led by a de@@ ep sen@@ se of un@@ e@@ ase about where our country will be tom@@ or@@ row .
Mr Jac@@ o@@ b Z@@ uma , For@@ mer Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Cong@@ res@@ s ;
We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machin@@ ery of government so that it meet@@ s its oblig@@ ations to citizens .
Accor@@ ding@@ ly , we will this year complete the lic@@ ens@@ ing and oper@@ ation@@ alisation of In@@ f@@ rac@@ o .
It is in@@ ev@@ itable that if we are to continue on our growth pat@@ h as a manufac@@ turing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry .
The second issue is about geograph@@ ic and place names , which requires a syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process across all provinces so we can create a base s@@ l@@ ate of changes we propo@@ se .
This is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same approach we must adop@@ t as we continue to pre@@ p@@ are to host the FIFA Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations C@@ up in 200@@ 9 and the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up which will k@@ ick off in our country 8@@ 5@@ 4 days from today .
All these hon@@ oured gu@@ ests , re@@ presenting both m@@ em@@ ory and hope , remin@@ d us by their presence that ours is a task in a rel@@ ay rac@@ e of continu@@ ous re@@ birth so that the dre@@ am of a better life becomes a re@@ ality for all South Africans .
The sen@@ se that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further a@@ field , represented by the ac@@ tual da@@ ily progress we are making in terms of our all@@ -@@ r@@ ound prepar@@ ations , is one of - Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al : all hand@@ s on dec@@ k for 2@@ 0@@ 10 !
improv@@ ing the effec@@ tiveness of our interven@@ tions direc@@ ted at the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y , and poverty er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation
I am ple@@ ased to say that we have inde@@ ed done much to imple@@ ment the commit@@ ments we made to the people in 200@@ 4 .
Our multi@@ fac@@ et@@ ed relations with the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Republic of Con@@ go will continue , as we se@@ ek to contribute to the efforts of the si@@ ster people of that country to at@@ tain las@@ ting peace , and imple@@ ment their re@@ construction and development programme .
F@@ ur@@ ther , it is critical to enh@@ ance the commitment of public employees to their du@@ ties â a task that bel@@ ong@@ s to the lead@@ ership , the public serv@@ ants themselves and the trade uni@@ on movement .
An instruc@@ tion has been issued for all government buil@@ dings to reduce their consu@@ mp@@ tion of electricity and please fe@@ el free to name and sha@@ me those who do not .
There are si@@ mp@@ le but urg@@ ent and critical prior@@ ities we will attend to , as part of the overall effor@@ t to improve the organisation and capacity of the state .
We must ensure that we susta@@ in this approach .
In the programme to provide sustainable human settle@@ ments , we are now able to provide 2@@ 6@@ 0 00@@ 0 housing un@@ its per ann@@ um , and an agreement has been re@@ ached with the South African Local Government Associ@@ ation to place a mor@@ ator@@ i@@ um on the sale of land that can be av@@ a@@ iled for the housing programme .
Most ob@@ vi@@ ously it would be ir@@ responsible to ign@@ ore these and other concer@@ ns or dis@@ mis@@ s them as m@@ ere j@@ er@@ em@@ i@@ ad@@ s typ@@ ical of the pr@@ oph@@ ets of d@@ oo@@ m .
The identification of the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities means that all three s@@ pher@@ es of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are h@@ ere@@ by making the fir@@ m under@@ taking that we will use the short period a@@ head of us further to ener@@ gi@@ se our adv@@ ance towards the re@@ alisation of the all@@ -@@ important go@@ al of a better life for all our people .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , given our large base of inst@@ al@@ led gener@@ ation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few econom@@ ies with affor@@ d@@ able electricity .
I will also shor@@ tly ann@@ oun@@ ce a team of E@@ ner@@ g@@ y Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons consi@@ sting of prom@@ in@@ ent and knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able South Africans who will assist government with the energy effici@@ ency campaign and inform invest@@ ors and communities on the ac@@ tual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges .
All these actions , taken together with the electricity sa@@ ving measures , will improve cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y and ra@@ ise the re@@ serve marg@@ in .
We will , of course , continue to carry out our t@@ as@@ ks in the United Nations Security Council .
I am confi@@ dent that 200@@ 8 will be one of the most re@@ mar@@ k@@ able years of our democracy , as we all work together to re@@ alise the c@@ ore asp@@ ir@@ ation of our people to at@@ tain a better life for all .
She says these mas@@ ses dem@@ and of all of us who cla@@ im to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them el@@ se@@ where in our country , whether we remain committed to the under@@ taking we have made that tom@@ or@@ row will be better than today .
Mad@@ am Speak@@ er of the National Assembly ;
The main categories of these prior@@ ities are :
Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ ement of a go@@ al of health for all includes inten@@ si@@ fied implementation of the National Str@@ ateg@@ ic Pl@@ an against HIV and AIDS .
Y@@ et another critical A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ ority is the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of an integrated and comprehensive anti-@@ poverty strategy that addres@@ ses especially sections of the population most affected by this sc@@ our@@ ge .
Ho@@ we@@ ver it is im@@ per@@ ative that all enterpri@@ ses become more energy efficient .
Head@@ s of the state organ@@ s supporting our constitutional democracy ;
Th@@ us , as part of our A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enh@@ ance governments capacity to put in place re@@ alis@@ tic and integrated plans , cover@@ ing all s@@ pher@@ es of government .
What she exp@@ ec@@ ts as her bir@@ th@@ day present is the tr@@ ut@@ h .
Chair@@ person of SA@@ L@@ G@@ A , ma@@ y@@ ors and leaders in our system of local government ;
Director@@ s-@@ General and other leaders of the public service ;
We are taking step@@ s to enh@@ ance E@@ sk@@ om@@ s maintenance capacity .
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chair@@ person@@ ship of SADC in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 200@@ 9 further to give imp@@ et@@ us to the regional en@@ de@@ av@@ ours in this regard .
Head@@ s of our Security Services ;
We ac@@ knowledge , both among the Hon@@ our@@ able Members and our gu@@ ests , the many found@@ ers of the United De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Fr@@ on@@ t , 2@@ 5 years ago .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , and not un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted@@ ly , it is ob@@ vi@@ ous that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard .
We have emerg@@ ency task team@@ s dealing with the challenge of co@@ al quality and supply with the co@@ al mining industry and we are working to f@@ ast trac@@ k the approval and construction of gas tur@@ b@@ ine projects .
These are :
rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system to inten@@ si@@ fy our off@@ ensive against crime
We face an emerg@@ ency but we can over@@ come the problems in a rel@@ atively short period .
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and elec@@ tor@@ al laws , and other matters that have been in con@@ ten@@ tion for many years .
For this , we will require a National W@@ ar R@@ oo@@ m for a W@@ ar A@@ ga@@ in@@ st P@@ over@@ ty br@@ ing@@ ing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Indu@@ stry , Agricul@@ ture and Land Affairs , Public Wor@@ ks and Health as well as provincial and local administr@@ ations , which will work with n@@ on@@ governmental organisations and business to identify the interven@@ tions required in specific house@@ holds and imple@@ ment them as a matter of urg@@ ency .
They are concerned about the national emerg@@ ency into which the country has been th@@ row@@ n by the un@@ expected dis@@ rup@@ tions in the supply of electricity .
As I was prepar@@ ing this Ad@@ dres@@ s , one among us sugg@@ ested to me that our country was being bu@@ f@@ fet@@ ed by strong cros@@ sw@@ in@@ ds that made it especially difficult to fore@@ see where our country will be tom@@ or@@ row .
inten@@ si@@ fying the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me which , by sur@@ pas@@ sing the set targ@@ ets , has sh@@ own potential to ab@@ sor@@ b more ent@@ ran@@ ts : this will include increased int@@ ake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure , dou@@ bl@@ ing the number of children en@@ rol@@ led in E@@ arly Child@@ ho@@ od Development to over 6@@ 00 00@@ 0 through 1 00@@ 0 new sites with more than 3 5@@ 00 practi@@ tion@@ ers trained and employed , and increasing the number of car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers .
I spe@@ ak here today in the presence of my mother , E@@ pain@@ et@@ te Mbe@@ ki , Ma@@ M@@ of@@ okeng , who came to communic@@ ate an un@@ equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ al mess@@ age from the rural mas@@ ses of the Trans@@ ke@@ i , among whom she has li@@ ved for many dec@@ ad@@ es .
As requested by the SADC Head@@ s of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negoti@@ ations .
We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ter rates from 10 to 7 , tra@@ in over 3 00@@ 0 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-@@ drug re@@ sist@@ ant and extre@@ me drug re@@ sist@@ ant TB pati@@ ents receive treatment .
The mas@@ sive Es@@ ko@@ m build programme in new gener@@ ation , trans@@ mission and distribution capacity will continue ;@@ and where possible , some projects will be ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated .
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by par@@ liam@@ ent , including the necessary constitutional amend@@ ments .
We shall also , during the course of this year , process the B@@ ills on the transformation of the judi@@ ci@@ ary in consultation with judg@@ es and magi@@ str@@ ates , complete the strategy aimed at strength@@ ening bor@@ der control and security , further give life to the V@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms Char@@ ter , pay particular atten@@ tion to the issue of repe@@ at off@@ end@@ ers , and continue the implementation of additional measures der@@ i@@ ving from recommend@@ ations of the Tr@@ ut@@ h and Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ation Commission .
In@@ de@@ ed , they re@@ present a celeb@@ ration of the in@@ dom@@ itable sp@@ iri@@ t of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not bet@@ ra@@ y or dis@@ appoint the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the people .
But we will all ag@@ ree that our society , and the poor specific@@ ally , cannot wa@@ it for strateg@@ ies and di@@ alogu@@ es and workshop@@ s â important as these may be .
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether we have the capacity to def@@ end the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
I particularly want to pay tri@@ bute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resol@@ ve a re@@ al cri@@ sis that h@@ it us on the 2@@ 4@@ th of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
You will ask whether I ag@@ ree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of con@@ fu@@ sion , in which all of us cannot but lo@@ se our way , un@@ sure of our step@@ s , un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y on our fe@@ et , fe@@ ar@@ ful of the future !
Once more we thank the S@@ pr@@ ing@@ bok@@ s for show@@ ing the way when they w@@ on the Ru@@ g@@ by World C@@ up last year .
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified der@@ i@@ ve from serious we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in terms of our planning .
And such is the in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion that history has im@@ posed on us today .
We will launch this syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ ised process soon , guid@@ ed by the South African Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Nam@@ es Council and its provincial commit@@ tees .
And so I qu@@ ote these words :
We will all work to minim@@ ise the adver@@ se impact these events had on the industry .
Government will start implemen@@ ting a campaign to ensure efficient ligh@@ ting , sol@@ ar water he@@ ating and ge@@ y@@ ser load management in house@@ holds , including housing standards for all new hou@@ ses and develop@@ ments .
The mu@@ sh@@ room@@ ing of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peop@@ les confir@@ ms that the Ch@@ in@@ a-@@ South Africa Par@@ t@@ nership for G@@ row@@ th and Development is a strategic relationship of mut@@ ual benefit , which can only g@@ row from streng@@ th to streng@@ th .
I say this because , in our own esti@@ mation , it is not often that a n@@ ation is called upon to stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to at@@ tain a dre@@ am .
We are a miner@@ als resource economy .@@ We must therefore continue to support the mining industry .
In this situation , we have to cur@@ ta@@ il the un@@ planned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce dem@@ and and thu@@ s ensure a better re@@ serve marg@@ in .
I would also like to take this opportunity to sal@@ ute President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , one of the pre-@@ em@@ in@@ ent foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers of our democracy , who will mar@@ k his 9@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day on 1@@ 8 J@@ uly this year .
Col@@ lec@@ tive effor@@ t and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emerg@@ ency .
ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ ement of the go@@ al of health for all
Our focus , in promo@@ ting the African Ag@@ end@@ a this year , will be on the strength@@ ening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , N@@ ep@@ ad .
The Minister of Education will next week el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the national deb@@ ate on these matters .
If any@@ thing , the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al should apply to all individu@@ als who carry the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being public serv@@ ants .
This ent@@ ails coordin@@ ating the programmes of the Stat@@ e-@@ owned En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses and over@@ la@@ ying all the infrastructure plans , including fre@@ ight and other log@@ is@@ tics , energy pip@@ el@@ ines , information and communic@@ ations technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their tim@@ ing and geograph@@ ic loc@@ ation .
At local government level , we shall assist the first 1@@ 50 of our municipalities to develop an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption strateg@@ ies .
While they recogn@@ ise and respect the right of the r@@ ul@@ ing party to regul@@ ate its own af@@ fairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the princip@@ al arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of a democratic , n@@ on@@ racial , n@@ on@@ sex@@ ist and pro@@ sp@@ erous South Africa .
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ;
These global responsib@@ ilities , including the ho@@ sting of the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up , bring out in even bol@@ der rel@@ ie@@ f the confi@@ dence that human@@ ity has in our country as a strategic play@@ er in the no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ ours of all human@@ ity .
This having been said , it is ho@@ we@@ ver also necessary that we take this opportunity to con@@ ve@@ y to the country the ap@@ ologi@@ es of both the Government and Es@@ ko@@ m for the national emerg@@ ency which has resul@@ ted in all of us having to con@@ ten@@ d with the consequ@@ ences of load she@@ d@@ ding .
Dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished gu@@ ests , fri@@ ends and com@@ ra@@ des ;
It was the best of times , it was the wor@@ st of times , it was the age of w@@ is@@ do@@ m , it was the age of f@@ ool@@ ish@@ ness , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of belie@@ f , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of incre@@ dul@@ ity , it was the seas@@ on of L@@ ight , it was the seas@@ on of Dar@@ k@@ ness , it was the sp@@ ring of hope , it was the win@@ ter of des@@ pa@@ ir , we had every@@ thing before us , we had no@@ thing before us , we were all going direct to He@@ av@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est authorities in@@ sist@@ ed on its being received , for good or for evi@@ l , in the super@@ l@@ ative de@@ g@@ ree of compar@@ is@@ on only .
There are con@@ cre@@ te actions each individual , household and business can take .
Pe@@ op@@ le of South Africa :
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settle@@ ments , people with dis@@ abilities or ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ nes@@ ses and the el@@ der@@ ly .
N@@ ex@@ t year , South Africa will play host to the Re@@ view Confer@@ ence to evalu@@ ate the implementation of the decisions of the World Confer@@ ence A@@ ga@@ in@@ st R@@ ac@@ ism which was held in our country in 200@@ 1 .
inten@@ si@@ fying efforts already started to scale up assistance to co@@ oper@@ atives and small enterpri@@ ses especially those invol@@ ving women , with empha@@ sis on providing training and market@@ s , including lin@@ king them up with established ou@@ tle@@ ts ;
Al@@ low me on this occa@@ sion of the pen@@ ul@@ tim@@ ate Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the thir@@ d Parliament for the ann@@ ual deb@@ ate on the state of our n@@ ation , to wish all the Hon@@ our@@ able Members of Parliament a happ@@ y and produc@@ tive New Y@@ e@@ ar .
To make certain that this happen@@ s , we have taken the necessary step@@ s to ensure that the Ann@@ ual B@@ ud@@ get the Minister of Fin@@ ance will present later this month makes the necessary alloc@@ ations to give us the means to imple@@ ment the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities .
L@@ ast week the Hon@@ our@@ able Members had an opportunity to reflec@@ t on these matters .
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether our country is threat@@ ened by the an@@ arch@@ y represented by the criminal tor@@ ching of six passeng@@ er tra@@ ins in Tsh@@ wane last month .
Govern@@ or of the Reser@@ ve Bank ;
Hon@@ our@@ able leaders of our political parties and Hon@@ our@@ able Members of Parliament ;
O@@ ver the past year , we carried out the man@@ date of SADC to assist the political lead@@ ership of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to the political challenges they face .
The enti@@ re@@ ty of our system of govern@@ ance is therefore making the commitment that in the period a@@ head of us , it will do its best to live up to the im@@ per@@ ative â Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al !
The details of other volun@@ t@@ ary and man@@ d@@ atory actions in the P@@ ow@@ er Con@@ servation Program@@ me have been set out by the Ministers and these will be re@@ fin@@ ed through consultation with the various stakehol@@ ders and then published .
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person , When we reflec@@ ted on the issue of crime at last years Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament , we all expres@@ sed gra@@ ve concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indic@@ ation that th@@ ings se@@ emed to be tur@@ ning for the wor@@ se especially in respect of murder â bu@@ c@@ king the tr@@ end of the improv@@ ement since the at@@ tain@@ ment of democracy .
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulner@@ able sectors such as v@@ eter@@ ans , women and youth , we shall review the structures deleg@@ ated to carry out these functions and exam@@ ine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specific@@ ally established to focus on youth development and em@@ power@@ ment .
But if all of us can for@@ ge strong partnerships to t@@ ack@@ le the situation , we will all come through â I hope rel@@ atively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed This is not a time for f@@ ing@@ er poin@@ ting , but for working together in fin@@ ding solu@@ tions .
At the mac@@ ro-@@ economic level , we will continue to maintain a f@@ is@@ cal post@@ ure that suppor@@ ts continued economic growth and development and reducing our ex@@ tern@@ al vulner@@ ability .
This will include the training of ma@@ ster train@@ ers who will provide basic liter@@ acy clas@@ ses to 3@@ 00 00@@ 0 a@@ dul@@ ts and youth in 200@@ 8 .
But we should not take this for granted .
Government will continue our industri@@ alisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
Chair@@ person of the National house of traditional leaders and our hon@@ oured traditional leaders ;
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in wh@@ at@@ ever way they can .
spe@@ eding up land and ag@@ r@@ arian re@@ form with deta@@ iled plans for land acqu@@ isi@@ tion , better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support , and improv@@ ing the capital base and re@@ ach of the Mic@@ ro-@@ Agricul@@ tural Fin@@ ance In@@ stitu@@ tions of South Africa to provide mic@@ ro-@@ credit in this sector : focus will be placed on areas of large concentr@@ ations of farm d@@ well@@ ers and those with high e@@ vic@@ tion rates , and we aim to increase black entreprene@@ ur@@ ship in agricultural production by 5 per year , and the audi@@ t on land ow@@ nership will be spe@@ ed@@ ed up ;
Let me therefore make bol@@ d to say that this histor@@ ical mom@@ ent dem@@ ands that our n@@ ation should un@@ ite as never before and stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to address our common challenges and keep ali@@ ve the dre@@ am that has susta@@ ined all of us as we travel@@ led along the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the cre@@ ation of the South Africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our Constitution .
A@@ mong other th@@ ings , we must use the current ad@@ versity to ensure that our hom@@ es and economy become more energy efficient .
spe@@ eding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social go@@ als
H@@ ap@@ p@@ ily , this State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s has given me the pos@@ sibility to report to Parliament and the N@@ ation on our 2@@ 4 A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities which , the H@@ on Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week .
The re@@ al challenge is to respon@@ d to them in a manner that con@@ ve@@ ys the defin@@ ite mess@@ age to every@@ body in our country and the milli@@ ons in Africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world who wat@@ ch our country with ke@@ en interest , that we remain fir@@ m in our resol@@ ve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people , but also to many others outside our bor@@ ders .
A@@ mong others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machin@@ ery so as to improve all as@@ pec@@ ts related to women em@@ power@@ ment .
What will continue to inform us as we take this ste@@ p will be the ab@@ sol@@ ute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , effici@@ ency and coordin@@ ation of our law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies .
As the Hon@@ our@@ able Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ;
Chair@@ person of the National Council of Provinc@@ es ;
N@@ ex@@ t week the Provincial Premi@@ ers will con@@ v@@ ene their for@@ a with ma@@ y@@ ors to plan and imple@@ ment the energy sa@@ ving measures in all the municipalities across the country .
They will be suppor@@ ted by technical team@@ s from E@@ D@@ I Hol@@ dings , Es@@ ko@@ m and the National E@@ ner@@ g@@ y E@@ ffici@@ ency Ag@@ ency .
Is@@ su@@ ed by : The Presid@@ ency F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 200@@ 8
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordin@@ ate this activity suppor@@ ted by the line Depart@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses .
Some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own economy of the thre@@ at of economic rec@@ es@@ sion in the United States .
Your Ex@@ cel@@ len@@ cies , Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ ors and High Commission@@ ers ;
I say this with un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able con@@ vic@@ tion because I am certain that South Africans are cap@@ able and ge@@ ar@@ ed to meet the challenge of history â to stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of our being â to respon@@ d to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and el@@ se@@ where in the world , and se@@ ize the opportunities that our countr@@ ys progress over the last f@@ our@@ te@@ en years has provided .
I men@@ tion this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some el@@ se@@ where in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents success@@ fully .
O@@ f great importance , our success in the fight against crime depend@@ s on co@@ operation among all of us as law@@ -@@ ab@@ i@@ ding citizens , in@@ sp@@ ired by the principles of ru@@ le of law , respect for our judi@@ ci@@ ary and pursu@@ it of equ@@ al human rights , which our Constitution enjo@@ ins us to ob@@ serve in our da@@ ily lives and pr@@ on@@ ounc@@ ements .
These are being dis@@ semin@@ ated by the Department of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and we remain open to any other sugg@@ es@@ tions that you , our comp@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ ts , may give to us and share with one another .
Hon@@ our@@ able Memb@@ ers@@ Hon@@ our@@ able Members
A@@ mong the key proposed interven@@ tions are : expan@@ ding the public works programme , employment subsi@@ dies for direct job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation for target@@ ed groups , enh@@ ancing employment search cap@@ ability , improv@@ ing education and training , improv@@ ing services and as@@ sets among poor communities , specific interven@@ tions in poor house@@ holds , and ensuring effec@@ tiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors .
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , recogn@@ ising that the Department of Home Affairs tou@@ ches the c@@ ore of every citizens life , we will this year inten@@ si@@ fy the implementation of the turn@@ around strategy approved by Cabinet .
introduc@@ ing the system of products for prefer@@ ential pro@@ cu@@ rement by government from small , medi@@ um and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses ;
In@@ de@@ ed , energy effici@@ ency itself provides economic opportunity .
but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and comple@@ ment@@ ary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime .
Cri@@ tical in this regard , is the strength@@ ening of co@@ operation between the UN Security Council and the Pe@@ ace and Security Council of the African Union .
In a meeting with the Chair@@ man of General Elec@@ tri@@ c during the course of last week , G@@ E offer@@ ed to assist by pro@@ cur@@ ing sc@@ ar@@ ce tur@@ b@@ ine equipment on our behalf .
The national emerg@@ ency represented by the current power out@@ ages po@@ ses the challenge and pres@@ ents the opportunity to the enti@@ re@@ ty of our n@@ ation to give con@@ cre@@ te expres@@ sion to the call we have just made for all of us to un@@ ite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course .
The first of these is a propos@@ al that we should develop an o@@ ath that will be rec@@ ited by learners in their mor@@ ning school as@@ sem@@ bli@@ es , as well as a Y@@ ou@@ th P@@ le@@ dge ext@@ oll@@ ing the vir@@ tu@@ es of human@@ e conduct and human solid@@ ar@@ ity among all South Africans .
We are also ple@@ ased that we have among us Mr Din@@ ile@@ si@@ z@@ we So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , son of the outstanding pat@@ ri@@ ot and leader , Ro@@ ber@@ t So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , who also passed away 30 years back after end@@ uring many years of im@@ prison@@ ment , ban@@ ishment and other forms of re@@ pres@@ sion .
We call on all African comp@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ ts to do wh@@ at@@ ever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these neg@@ ative develop@@ ments .
The Department of Public Service and Ad@@ min@@ istration will set up a monitoring system to trac@@ k the implementation of this decision .
G@@ i@@ ven that we are approach@@ ing the end of our man@@ date term , the Government dec@@ ided that it should identify a su@@ ite of A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities on which it must focus in a special way , using these as cat@@ al@@ y@@ sts further to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate progress towards the achiev@@ ement of the objectives the people man@@ d@@ ated us to pursu@@ e .
To ensure syst@@ ema@@ tic monitoring in this regard , SA@@ L@@ G@@ A has agreed to provide quar@@ ter@@ ly reports on the work being done .
Let me now turn to the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities I mentioned .
We are about to beg@@ in the last full financial year of the current and thir@@ d democratic par@@ liam@@ ent and government soon after which we will hold our f@@ our@@ th general elec@@ tions .
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prior@@ iti@@ se further interven@@ tions in the further education and training col@@ leg@@ es , the sector education and training authorities , resourc@@ ing schools in the low@@ est three qu@@ in@@ ti@@ les , fre@@ e@@ ing them from the responsibility to charge fe@@ es , and spe@@ eding up on-@@ the@@ -@@ job training for professional gra@@ du@@ ates .
This must say to all of us that we are inde@@ ed in a period of challenges , but sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table challenges .
As the Hon@@ our@@ able Members know , she said : I don@@ t regard the problems of energy supply here as a disa@@ ster .
He sugg@@ ested that this mor@@ ning , to cap@@ ture what he consid@@ ers the essen@@ ce of the re@@ ality con@@ fron@@ ting us , I should rec@@ all the well-@@ known words with which Char@@ les D@@ ick@@ ens opened his no@@ vel , A T@@ ale of Two C@@ ities .
The Minister of Fin@@ ance will provide more information in the B@@ ud@@ get spe@@ ec@@ h on the support that the government will provide for the energy effici@@ ency campaign and to Es@@ ko@@ m in its build programme .
In@@ de@@ ed , we are gre@@ at@@ ly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstr@@ ated through the commitment by the CE@@ O@@ s of 7@@ 0 of the J@@ SE@@ -@@ listed companies to work with government in addres@@ sing the challenge of sc@@ ar@@ ce skills .
O@@ f course , I have ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no doub@@ t that we will hon@@ our our under@@ taking to FIFA and the world community of s@@ occ@@ er players and lo@@ vers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent .
Wor@@ king with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the under@@ sea c@@ ables .
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special atten@@ tion during this year , and ensure that we meet the targ@@ ets we have set our@@ selves .
This is driven by such develop@@ ments as the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the National Commissioner of Police , the susp@@ en@@ sion of the National Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions , fe@@ ars about a thre@@ at to the in@@ depend@@ ence of the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the ru@@ le of law , and the att@@ end@@ ant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes .
At@@ t@@ ached to this will be a manufac@@ turing strategy for the development in South Africa of Se@@ t T@@ op Bo@@ x@@ es , which should be fin@@ alised by the mid@@ d@@ le of the year .
and through the S@@ mal@@ l En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses Development Ag@@ ency setting up a ri@@ gor@@ ous system to ensure that the 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day payment period is ob@@ served .
A@@ mong other th@@ ings , this will ent@@ a@@ il setting up a new coordin@@ ating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , br@@ ing@@ ing together the judi@@ ci@@ ary and magi@@ str@@ acy , the police , pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors , correc@@ tional services and the Leg@@ al A@@ id Bo@@ ard , as well as other interven@@ tions , including the em@@ power@@ ment of the Community Police For@@ ums .
And prec@@ is@@ ely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity !
This must in@@ sp@@ ire B@@ af@@ ana B@@ af@@ ana , as it must in@@ sp@@ ire our ath@@ let@@ es who will comp@@ ete in the Beij@@ ing Olymp@@ ic G@@ ames later this year .
At the same time , we aim to provide dig@@ ital broad@@ casting to 50 of the population by the end of the year .
And South Africa is not al@@ one : there are pres@@ su@@ res on supply regarding our expan@@ sion projects in Ch@@ ile and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
The programme that we have ou@@ tl@@ ined incorpor@@ ates the commit@@ ments that our country has agreed with the lead@@ ership of the continent through the African Pe@@ er Re@@ view M@@ echan@@ ism .
It is in this contex@@ t , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multi@@ lat@@ eral inter@@ actions with our neigh@@ b@@ ours and the Europ@@ ean Union , within the contex@@ t of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership Agre@@ ement are completed as soon as possible , premi@@ sed on ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the development of our region .
The Offic@@ e of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard .
F@@ ur@@ ther , after correc@@ ting we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in our A@@ dul@@ t Ba@@ sic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the Kh@@ a R@@ i G@@ ude mas@@ s liter@@ acy campaign .
They are concerned about some develop@@ ments in our economy , especially the ste@@ ad@@ y increase in interest rates , food and fu@@ el pric@@ es which further im@@ pover@@ ish especially the poor .
T@@ ask team@@ s are currently working in many areas .
enh@@ ancing the impact of our programmes targ@@ e@@ ting the cri@@ tically important area of education and training
In any case , most of the interven@@ tions possible are th@@ ings that government is already doing though not suffici@@ ently integrated .
We welcome to this occa@@ sion Mr Ar@@ thu@@ r M@@ arg@@ e@@ man , re@@ presenting the v@@ eter@@ ans of the A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra bus bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t of fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , who include N@@ el@@ son Mandela .
H@@ av@@ ing said all that I have said , I come back to the question : what is the state of our n@@ ation as we enter 200@@ 8 !
Wor@@ king with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption Program@@ me is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented .
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proce@@ ed as we keep our e@@ y@@ es fir@@ m@@ ly foc@@ used on the continued pursu@@ it of the go@@ al of a better life for all our people .
This year we celeb@@ rate the t@@ ent@@ h ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the establishment of diplom@@ atic relations between South Africa and the Pe@@ op@@ les Republic of China .
This we shall do , in@@ sp@@ ired by the common asp@@ ir@@ ation of the peop@@ les of the continent for greater integration in pursu@@ it of contin@@ ental unity at all levels .
As we act together every@@ where in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is â Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al !
F@@ ur@@ ther to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate our economic growth and development we will imple@@ ment the Indu@@ stri@@ al Polic@@ y Ac@@ tion Pl@@ an .
State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s of the President of South Africa , Tha@@ bo Mbe@@ ki : Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 200@@ 8
We are confi@@ dent that , informed by their ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ence of the sc@@ our@@ ge of rac@@ ism and the de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating consequ@@ ences it continues to ex@@ act on human@@ ity , the governments and peop@@ les of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Re@@ view Confer@@ ence achiev@@ es its objectives .
In South Africa our own large companies such as S@@ as@@ ol , Ang@@ lo and B@@ H@@ P B@@ ill@@ it@@ on are all in con@@ cre@@ te discussions with the Depart@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses to find cost effective and sustainable solu@@ tions to the supply con@@ stra@@ int .
This includes improv@@ ing the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , ro@@ o@@ ting out cor@@ rup@@ t el@@ ements and p@@ il@@ o@@ ting the new ID car@@ d .
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses have ou@@ tl@@ ined the nature of the emerg@@ ency we con@@ front and what each one of us can do to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation .
Dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished Premi@@ ers and Speak@@ ers of our Provinc@@ es ;
We are also pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed to have among us Ms J@@ an@@ n T@@ ur@@ ner , the da@@ ugh@@ ter of Ric@@ k T@@ ur@@ ner who was mur@@ der@@ ed by apartheid ag@@ ents 30 years ago .
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Pre@@ vention and Security C@@ lu@@ ster will el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week .
Ab@@ out R@@ 1 bil@@ li@@ on over the ba@@ sel@@ ine will be allocated to programmes that fall within the E@@ P@@ W@@ P ;
Let us therefore use this emerg@@ ency to put in place the first building bloc@@ ks of the essential energy efficient future we d@@ are not avo@@ id .
We had an opportunity , on the fr@@ ing@@ es of the AU Summit in Ad@@ di@@ s A@@ ba@@ ba for@@ mally to present a comprehensive report to the lead@@ ership of SADC on this matter .
In this regard , in the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , moder@@ n@@ ised , efficient and trans@@ formed criminal justice system .
The approach is one of common action rather than rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation .
We ur@@ ge house@@ holds that can affor@@ d to act immediately to consid@@ er implemen@@ ting these energ@@ y-@@ sa@@ ving measures .
In this regard , R2@@ ,@@ 3 bil@@ li@@ on has been budget@@ ed for industrial policy initiatives and a further R@@ 5 bil@@ li@@ on in tax inc@@ enti@@ ves over three years will support industrial policy .
Im@@ prov@@ ement of performance in the public service also depend@@ s on the quality of lead@@ ership provided by the executive and senior management .
The Government has therefore re@@ view@@ ed the di@@ stance we have travel@@ led in terms of implemen@@ ting the man@@ date given by the people in 200@@ 4 .
Our est@@ e@@ emed Chief Justice and members of the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary ;
enh@@ ancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and Sou@@ th-@@ South relations .
We will also integr@@ ate the programme to spe@@ ed up the development of sustainable human settle@@ ments , with inten@@ si@@ fied efforts , as a matter of urg@@ ent pri@@ ority , to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate uni@@ vers@@ al access to water , san@@ itation and electricity , so that by 2@@ 0@@ 14 , we should have dec@@ ent human settle@@ ments and access by all house@@ holds to these services .
With all hand@@ s on dec@@ k , and committed to conduct our business in an un@@ usu@@ al and more effective fas@@ hi@@ on , we shall susta@@ in the process of our re@@ construction and development and take it to even higher levels .
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , bene@@ fi@@ ting from the consult@@ ations that have started with social partners .
Al@@ ong with the progress we are making in the variety of interven@@ tions foc@@ used on poverty reduc@@ tion , we continue to address a number many we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses , including the processing of the Land U@@ se Management Bill , the fin@@ alisation of the land re@@ stitution cases , the support programme for those who acqu@@ ire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme .
In eight days time , on F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 1@@ 6 , she will be 9@@ 2 years old .
Wor@@ king together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urg@@ ently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not ex@@ ist , such as mining and miner@@ als benef@@ ici@@ ation , consu@@ mer d@@ ur@@ ables , reta@@ il with a focus on improv@@ ing support to small enterpri@@ ses , construction , the cre@@ ative industri@@ es , agricul@@ ture and ag@@ ro-@@ processing .@@ Once more I would like to empha@@ si@@ se that we remain determined to support the aut@@ omo@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Mo@@ tor Indu@@ stry Development Program@@ me is main@@ tained .
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , by Ma@@ y of every year all senior manag@@ ers should have fi@@ led their Ke@@ y Per@@ forman@@ ce Agre@@ ements with relevant authorities .
H@@ av@@ ing no@@ ted that the t@@ ar@@ din@@ ess with which government processes applications for investment in rel@@ ation to issues such as land acqu@@ isi@@ tion , infrastructure and environmental impact assess@@ ments can at times make or bre@@ ak invest@@ or decisions , we have dec@@ ided , in the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , work is progres@@ sing urg@@ ently to set up a call centre through which prospec@@ tive invest@@ ors and government can trac@@ k these processes .
This situation has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the in@@ ev@@ itable re@@ alisation that the era of very che@@ a@@ p and ab@@ und@@ ant electricity has come to an end .
In the same meas@@ ure , we shall continue to contribute to the re@@ alisation of the objectives of the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on C@@ li@@ mate Ch@@ ange and on@@ going improv@@ ements in this regard , and in giving further imp@@ et@@ us to the negoti@@ ations on the W@@ T@@ O Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound .
To spe@@ ed up the process of building infrastructure we will fin@@ alise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific empha@@ sis on energy effici@@ ency .
In short , the parties involved in the di@@ alogu@@ e have re@@ ached full agreement on all matters relating to the substan@@ tive matters the parties had to address .
Th@@ us should we all re@@ affir@@ m that we remain on course as we continue to stri@@ ve to make ours a win@@ ning n@@ ation .
Accor@@ ding@@ ly , last year we eng@@ aged in syst@@ ema@@ tic inter@@ action with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a hol@@ istic approach towards rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system in its tot@@ ality .
M@@ ore than at any other time , the situation that con@@ fron@@ ts our n@@ ation and country , and the t@@ as@@ ks we have set our@@ selves , dem@@ and that we in@@ sp@@ ire and organ@@ ise all our people to act together as one , to do all the th@@ ings that have to be done , understanding that in a very re@@ al sen@@ se , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hand@@ s !
As we put all our hand@@ s on dec@@ k and ge@@ ar our@@ selves for Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al we should also inten@@ si@@ fy national di@@ alogu@@ e on the issues that defin@@ e us as a n@@ ation .
We are fully aware that a critical el@@ ement of our prepar@@ ations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the foot@@ b@@ all fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ity pr@@ ou@@ d .
S@@ ure , the problems here are serious ;@@ over@@ coming them will require ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity , especially in energy effici@@ ency and energy sa@@ ving , as well as the development of altern@@ ative power sup@@ pl@@ ies .
Let us ensure that all hand@@ s are on dec@@ k to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has h@@ it us , in@@ sp@@ ired by the approach that our circumstances call for Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al !
C@@ ut@@ ting across these plans , and therefore a critical pri@@ ority , is information and communic@@ ations technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right .
We spe@@ ak of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al not refer@@ ring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the spe@@ ed@@ y , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , so@@ on@@ er rather than later .
Fir@@ stly , it has been agreed across all s@@ pher@@ es of government that especially the critical vac@@ an@@ cies should be fil@@ led within six months of such op@@ en@@ ings emerg@@ ing .
I am confi@@ dent that , under the lead@@ ership of the International Mar@@ keting Council , Trade and Inv@@ est@@ ment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other ag@@ encies we shall all put our hand@@ s on dec@@ k to communic@@ ate to the rest of the world the sp@@ iri@@ t of Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al , and our continu@@ ing adv@@ ance towards the cre@@ ation of a society that car@@ es and the conditions for the world to ga@@ ther in our country to celeb@@ rate Afric@@ as human@@ ity in 2@@ 0@@ 10 .
The resul@@ t@@ ant ti@@ ght supply situation makes the overall system vulner@@ able to any incid@@ ent affec@@ ting the avail@@ ability of energy .

Accor@@ ding@@ ly , we jo@@ in the SADC Head@@ s of State and Government in congrat@@ ul@@ ating the parties to the Zimbabwe Di@@ alogu@@ e for their tr@@ uly commen@@ d@@ able achiev@@ ements and encourage them to work together to resol@@ ve the re@@ ma@@ ining proced@@ ural matter .
I would also like to thank all citizens for their res@@ ili@@ ence and for@@ be@@ aring in the face of the current difficul@@ ties .
As government our task is to now lead and un@@ ite the country behind a campaign for energy effici@@ ency that will address this challenge .
Par@@ alle@@ l to this initi@@ ative is a special project to exam@@ ine interven@@ tions required to deal with vulner@@ able children over the age of 14 .
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elec@@ tions sche@@ du@@ led for the 2@@ 9@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person@@ At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consider@@ ation whether their success is hel@@ ping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weap@@ on in our W@@ ar on P@@ over@@ ty and ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the at@@ tain@@ ment of such objectives as the reduc@@ tion of un@@ employment and adv@@ ancing the go@@ al of health for all .
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector uni@@ ons , we will con@@ v@@ ene a Public Sec@@ tor Summit to th@@ ras@@ h out these issues so that the sp@@ iri@@ t of Batho Pele can find con@@ cre@@ te expres@@ sion wh@@ er@@ ever a government service is provided .
Wor@@ k to review the National Human Res@@ our@@ ce Development Str@@ ateg@@ y will be completed this year , and the projects that the jo@@ int team of government , labour , business and academ@@ ic institutions organised under the Jo@@ int In@@ iti@@ ative on Pri@@ ority S@@ k@@ ills Ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion will be inten@@ si@@ fied .
On the supply side Es@@ ko@@ m is working fu@@ ri@@ ously to ensure the introduc@@ tion of co-@@ gener@@ ation projects as a matter of urg@@ ency .
ï»¿@@ In this regard , we sal@@ ute that bra@@ ve son of our people , S@@ ol@@ om@@ on K@@ alu@@ sh@@ i Ma@@ hlang@@ u who went to the g@@ allow@@ s 30 years ago with his head held high , in the pr@@ ou@@ d knowledge that his b@@ lo@@ od would n@@ ou@@ ris@@ h the t@@ ree of freedom .
but also to put in place measures that would ob@@ vi@@ ate a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence .
In the Fir@@ st Dec@@ ad@@ e of Fre@@ edom , economic growth a@@ ver@@ aged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on a@@ ver@@ age from 200@@ 4 to 200@@ 7 .
I have wal@@ ked that long road to freedom .
O@@ f critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
These then are some of the adv@@ ances that democracy has brought ;
And we do hope that this time r@@ ound , the renew@@ ed efforts of the international community to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to this conflict will be@@ ar fru@@ it , so Israel@@ is and Palestin@@ i@@ ans can enjo@@ y peace and security as neigh@@ b@@ ours within their so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ies .
These immedi@@ ate measures will be informed by the princip@@ le of a counter@@ -@@ cyc@@ lic@@ al f@@ is@@ cal policy .
continu@@ ing research and consult@@ ations on the Com@@ prehensive Social Security Sy@@ st@@ em , including the matter of National Health In@@ sur@@ ance ;
In the end , the challenge is as much about regul@@ ation ;
In education , we have seen a dro@@ p in the educ@@ ator : lear@@ ner r@@ ati@@ o ;
We are also hear@@ ten@@ ed that research into HIV pre@@ val@@ ence demonstr@@ ates stabil@@ isation and a s@@ light reduc@@ tion in rates of infec@@ tion .
Y@@ et access to employment we@@ igh@@ s heav@@ ily on rural women , youth and people with dis@@ ability .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , while women con@@ stitute about 3@@ 4 of all senior posi@@ tions in the public service , this fall@@ s short of the targ@@ et of par@@ ity that we had set our@@ selves .
But be@@ y@@ ond this , the tr@@ ue legacy of this spec@@ t@@ ac@@ le will be in our ability to show@@ case South African and African hospit@@ ality and human@@ ity â to change once and for all per@@ cep@@ tions of our country and our continent among peop@@ les of the world .
continu@@ ing with the W@@ ar on P@@ over@@ ty campaign and fin@@ alising the dra@@ ft of the Com@@ prehensive An@@ ti@@ -@@ poverty Str@@ ateg@@ y through the public consult@@ ations now under way ;
In@@ de@@ ed , it is a matter of pr@@ ou@@ d record that between 199@@ 5 and 200@@ 3 , the economy cre@@ ated about one-@@ and-@@ half milli@@ on net new job@@ s ;
That we were able five months ago to ensure a se@@ am@@ less tran@@ si@@ tion and continu@@ ity in the systems of government is than@@ ks to the mat@@ urity of our constitutional system , reflec@@ ted in part in the co@@ operation of members of the Executive â old and new â and the ste@@ ad@@ y hand of our public sector manag@@ ers .
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hard@@ ly dif@@ fer regarding the need to improve our education system ;
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services .
But we should also take advant@@ age of the special registration week@@ end arrang@@ ed by the Elec@@ tor@@ al Commission of South Africa tom@@ or@@ row and Sun@@ day , the 7@@ th and 8@@ th of F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary respec@@ tively .
access to fin@@ ance and inf@@ low@@ s of capital have tur@@ ned for the wor@@ se ;
Ho@@ we@@ ver , much more needs to be done to improve the service cul@@ ture and orient@@ ation of some public serv@@ ants , especially those at the co@@ al-@@ face of direct inter@@ action with the public .
addres@@ sing the investment challenge by improv@@ ing sa@@ v@@ ings , appropri@@ ately de@@ plo@@ ying resources from pen@@ sion and provi@@ dent funds , housing , financial sector contri@@ bu@@ tions and black economic em@@ power@@ ment ;
Mad@@ am Deputy President ;
We do have today a well-@@ function@@ ing democratic system , based on principles of transpar@@ ency and op@@ en@@ ness , with num@@ erous plat@@ forms for public participation and independent institutions man@@ d@@ ated by the Constitution to support democracy .
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaign@@ s on child im@@ mun@@ isation and n@@ utri@@ tion .
Y@@ et our central and immedi@@ ate task is fully to appreci@@ ate the consequ@@ ences of these develop@@ ments on our own economy and our region , and de@@ vi@@ se respon@@ ses that will minim@@ ise their impact especially on the most vulner@@ able sectors of our society .
Th@@ ough some progress has been made , at 0@@ ,@@ 2 , the situation is less im@@ pres@@ sive with regard to people with dis@@ ability employed in government , measu@@ red against the 2 targ@@ et we set our@@ selves .
On a critical matter of deta@@ il , the resear@@ ch@@ ers further ob@@ serve :
In the coming few months pen@@ ding the national and provincial elec@@ tions , we will en@@ de@@ av@@ our to complete that popul@@ ar man@@ date .
and facilit@@ ating the processes aimed at strength@@ ening the machin@@ er@@ ies dealing with matters of gender equ@@ ality such as 5@@ 0@@ /@@ 50 represent@@ ation in deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making structures , youth development , the rights of people with dis@@ ability and children@@ s rights â including comple@@ ting consult@@ ations on the National Y@@ ou@@ th Polic@@ y , prepar@@ ing for the implementation of the African Y@@ ou@@ th Char@@ ter once it has been proces@@ sed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Y@@ ou@@ th Development Ag@@ ency ;
In this regard , some five years ago , we were ho@@ ver@@ ing around 1@@ 6 of g@@ ross fi@@ xed capital formation as a per@@ cent@@ age of G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Pro@@ duc@@ t . Su@@ ch has been the ac@@ cel@@ eration in investment that today this fi@@ g@@ ure stand@@ s at 2@@ 2 , clo@@ ser to the 2@@ 5 that we projec@@ ted to at@@ tain only in 2@@ 0@@ 14 .
Ex@@ cep@@ t for the services sector , we have not seen a large en@@ ough expan@@ sion in critical sectors , especially manufac@@ turing .
This points to we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in our neighbour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds , especially in building the bon@@ ds of community solid@@ ar@@ ity that would assist us in pre@@ ven@@ ting and com@@ ba@@ ting crime .
For inst@@ ance , access to pot@@ able water has improved from 6@@ 2 in 199@@ 6 to 8@@ 8 in 200@@ 8 ;
This will be comb@@ ined with promotion of the P@@ rou@@ d@@ ly South Africa campaign and str@@ ong@@ er action on illegal impor@@ ts .
We also comm@@ it our@@ selves to meet the objectives of international agre@@ ements , including the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l and its success@@ ors for the benefit of future gener@@ ations among our own people and peop@@ les of the world .
With@@ in this gener@@ ation are the early leaders of SA@@ S@@ O , which included : Str@@ ini Mo@@ od@@ ley , Prof@@ ess@@ or Bar@@ ney P@@ it@@ yana , Ste@@ ve B@@ ik@@ o , On@@ kgop@@ ot@@ se Tir@@ o , Har@@ ry N@@ eng@@ we@@ kh@@ ulu , Th@@ em@@ ba S@@ ono , Map@@ e@@ tla Mo@@ hap@@ i , Mo@@ si@@ ou@@ a Lek@@ ota , Joh@@ nn@@ y Is@@ sel and M@@ thul@@ i ka S@@ he@@ zi .
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreci@@ ation that measures to protect the environment and m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
I@@ ron@@ ically , prec@@ is@@ ely where education is most needed to help bre@@ ak the cyc@@ le of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teach@@ er capacity are least im@@ pres@@ sive .
All these are assign@@ ments for the coming period .
With regard to household access to basic services , the fi@@ gu@@ res spe@@ ak for themselves .
and to conduct f@@ is@@ cal and mon@@ et@@ ary policy in a manner that exp@@ ands access to services and reduc@@ es the inf@@ l@@ ation@@ ary bur@@ den while at the same time ensuring mac@@ ro@@ economic st@@ ability and sustain@@ ability .
but , hop@@ eful@@ ly , also with regard to political di@@ alogu@@ e .
This also im@@ pl@@ ies a rap@@ id reduc@@ tion in government deb@@ t levels wh@@ en@@ ever conditions turn for the better .
Hon@@ our@@ able Le@@ ad@@ ers of Pol@@ iti@@ cal Par@@ ties and Members of Parliament , Tra@@ ditional leaders ;
Government is pain@@ fully aware that abj@@ ect poverty is still too wid@@ es@@ pre@@ ad in our society ;
Members of Cabinet and Speak@@ ers of Provincial Leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ures ;
F@@ our@@ th@@ ly , government will susta@@ in and exp@@ and social expen@@ dit@@ ure , including progres@@ sively exten@@ ding access to the child support grant to children of 1@@ 8 years of age and reducing the age of el@@ ig@@ ib@@ ility for old age pen@@ sion to 6@@ 0 years for men .
Th@@ us , the question whether growth is equ@@ it@@ ably shar@@ ed should form a central p@@ il@@ la@@ r of all our economic consider@@ ations .
We o@@ we our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 2@@ 7 A@@ pri@@ l 199@@ 4 , for the first time collec@@ tively took their destin@@ y into their own hand@@ s .
This will include support by our development fin@@ ance institutions and lo@@ an fin@@ ance from international ag@@ encies , as well as partnership with the private sector and uti@@ l@@ isation of resources control@@ led by workers such as pen@@ sion funds .
In@@ de@@ ed , these ob@@ serv@@ ations are confir@@ med by our own research , which show@@ s that income poverty especially among African and Col@@ oured communities has dec@@ lin@@ ed , par@@ tly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social gr@@ ants .
This is not in pursu@@ it of a so@@ -@@ called racial ag@@ end@@ a .
lower dem@@ and has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated a sc@@ al@@ ing down of production ;
And so , Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Hon@@ our@@ able Chair@@ person , we should ask our@@ selves : how have our actions defined the pat@@ h of South African societ@@ ys ev@@ ol@@ ution in the fi@@ f@@ te@@ en years since the birth of our democracy ;@@ and how have we adv@@ anced the cause of human development and human dign@@ ity since the 200@@ 4 democratic man@@ date !
We are pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed that this year we conclud@@ e celeb@@ r@@ ations of the first dec@@ ad@@ e of our diplom@@ atic relations with the Pe@@ op@@ les Republic of China .
It is in this contex@@ t that the Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and S@@ har@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical bloc@@ k@@ ages such as infrastructure bot@@ tl@@ en@@ ec@@ ks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regul@@ atory gri@@ d@@ loc@@ ks and effici@@ ency of government services are addres@@ sed in a foc@@ us@@ sed and syst@@ ema@@ tic manner .
F@@ ur@@ ther , our anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment programme is not only the larg@@ est in the world ;
There can be no jus@@ tific@@ ation for such acts of wan@@ ton de@@ struc@@ tion and sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ery .
In this regard , Hon@@ our@@ able Members , I am happ@@ y to report that in the inter@@ actions between The Presid@@ ency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jo@@ in@@ tly to de@@ vi@@ se interven@@ tions that would minim@@ ise the impact of this cri@@ sis on our society .
At the same time , much effor@@ t has been put into improv@@ ing infrastructure in poor areas .
Com@@ ra@@ des and fri@@ ends ;
In addition , we will more wid@@ ely utili@@ se the Social Di@@ st@@ res@@ s Rel@@ ie@@ f G@@ r@@ ant and food security measures specific@@ ally also to targ@@ et those either un@@ protec@@ ted by the Un@@ employment In@@ sur@@ ance Fun@@ d or who have ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted their benefits .
We wish on this occa@@ sion to exten@@ d our congrat@@ ul@@ ations to the people and the lead@@ ership of Z@@ ambi@@ a , G@@ h@@ ana and the United States of Americ@@ a for elec@@ tions the sym@@ bol@@ ism of which trans@@ c@@ ends the n@@ ar@@ row b@@ ound@@ aries of their nation@@ -@@ st@@ ates .
The For@@ mer Chief Justice and For@@ mer Pre@@ si@@ ding Offic@@ ers of Parliament ;
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , we will inten@@ si@@ fy public sector employment programmes .
V@@ ari@@ ous measures have been put in place to improve the effici@@ ency of the public service , including financial management , Th@@ us@@ ong Service Cent@@ res and other service delivery innov@@ ations , iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , fir@@ m lead@@ ership .
Our special congrat@@ ul@@ ations to the government and people of Cu@@ ba on this the 5@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the at@@ tain@@ ment of their so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty and , with it , the freedom to ch@@ oo@@ se their pat@@ h of development .
On its part , government will ad@@ ap@@ t industrial fin@@ ancing and inc@@ en@@ tive instru@@ ments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development fin@@ ance institutions to assist fir@@ ms in di@@ st@@ res@@ s because of the cri@@ sis .
In our own country , we will emb@@ ar@@ k on these under@@ tak@@ ings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development pat@@ h .
We wish in this regard to congrat@@ ul@@ ate all the parties in Zimbabwe for conclu@@ ding negoti@@ ations , deliver@@ ing the ul@@ tim@@ ate pri@@ ze that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ continent as a whole : that is , a stable and leg@@ iti@@ mate government ge@@ ar@@ ed to address the challenges that the people face .
Chief Justice L@@ anga ;
But we are all too aware that , because we are str@@ ong@@ ly integrated into the world economy , dem@@ and for our expor@@ ts has dec@@ lin@@ ed ;
At the same time we will improve SAD@@ C@@ s inter@@ action with the Comm@@ on Mar@@ ket of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community . These initiatives will be under@@ taken in order to exten@@ d rather than we@@ ak@@ en the de@@ ep set of relations that we enjo@@ y within the Southern African Custom@@ s Union .
But ours is a jour@@ ney of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence .
And so , 1@@ 5 years into our democracy , we can as@@ ser@@ t that the fe@@ ar , the in@@ security and the lo@@ a@@ thing that 1@@ 00 years ago gener@@ ated an exclu@@ sive and ill@@ us@@ ory peace among col@@ on@@ ial ma@@ sters , were not only un@@ foun@@ ded ;
adv@@ ancing equ@@ ity , developing skills , cre@@ ating economic opportunities and exten@@ ding services ;
At the level of the national and provincial legislat@@ ures , indic@@ ations are that the n@@ ation will this year sur@@ pas@@ s the 3@@ 2 women represent@@ ation level achiev@@ ed in 200@@ 4 and hop@@ eful@@ ly , even the 4@@ 0 achiev@@ ed in the 200@@ 6 local government elec@@ tions .
G@@ ini@@ el de V@@ il@@ li@@ ers and his team have w@@ on the D@@ ak@@ ar R@@ ally ;
The fact that the private sector l@@ ag@@ s behind in chang@@ ing the de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ics of management and sk@@ illed occup@@ ations , in enterpri@@ se development and so on in part makes our country a l@@ ag@@ gar@@ d in the high growth stak@@ es .
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the targ@@ et for 1@@ -@@ milli@@ on work opportunities through the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me was at@@ tained in 200@@ 8 , a year earli@@ er than envis@@ aged in the 200@@ 4 elec@@ tor@@ al man@@ date .
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the f@@ is@@ c@@ us as an instru@@ ment of re@@ distribution and shar@@ ing the bur@@ den of providing public goods .
Cri@@ tically , we should also saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the integr@@ ity of the world trade system , complete the current negoti@@ ations on the Do@@ ha R@@ ound of world trade negoti@@ ations , and ensure that development a@@ id is not sc@@ al@@ ed down .
They include Bri@@ an B@@ un@@ ting , B@@ il@@ ly Na@@ ir , N@@ cum@@ i@@ sa K@@ ond@@ lo , Joh@@ n G@@ om@@ omo , Jo@@ e N@@ hlan@@ hla , C@@ as S@@ al@@ oo@@ je@@ e , Joh@@ n Sch@@ ip@@ p@@ ers and J@@ an van E@@ ck .
Spec@@ ial men@@ tion in this regard is due to SADC facilit@@ ator , former President Tha@@ bo Mbe@@ ki and the team that tir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly and pati@@ ently hel@@ ped to bring the process to a successful conclu@@ sion .
In the tow@@ ering m@@ em@@ ory of these students of yester@@ year resid@@ es an ab@@ i@@ ding mess@@ age , that the thir@@ st for freedom and knowledge bur@@ ns even str@@ ong@@ er in the bos@@ om@@ s of our youth .
J@@ ust two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mal@@ i part of the ar@@ chi@@ ves to pre@@ serve the anci@@ ent man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts of T@@ im@@ bu@@ k@@ t@@ u .
We call to min@@ d these organisations and leaders to empha@@ si@@ se the sp@@ iri@@ t of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence that in@@ fu@@ sed the democratic struggle even when every@@ thing look@@ ed ble@@ ak ;
and exten@@ ding the number of municipalities that have set up Child@@ ren@@ s Rights F@@ oc@@ al Po@@ in@@ ts be@@ y@@ ond the current 6@@ 0 .
and our under@@ -@@ 2@@ 0 s@@ occ@@ er team did quite well in an extre@@ mel@@ y competi@@ tive environment .
Hon@@ our@@ able Members will be fam@@ ili@@ ar with most of the data on matters relating to the social w@@ age .
and cri@@ mes against women and children have not ab@@ ated in any significant meas@@ ure , is a matter of great concern .
It points to we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in the effici@@ ency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management .
We are also encouraged that , wh@@ at@@ ever f@@ its and star@@ ts may se@@ em to character@@ ise the progress of the people of the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Republic of Con@@ go on their mar@@ ch to st@@ ability and pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity , that progress is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
That initi@@ ative la@@ id the found@@ ation for global con@@ sen@@ su@@ s , through the United Nations , on the approach to negoti@@ ations in South Africa .
Com@@ b@@ ined , these develop@@ ments bo@@ de ill for the re@@ ven@@ ues we need to exp@@ and the provision of services and to imple@@ ment our infrastructure projects .
In a few months from now the people of our country will pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce on the lead@@ ership they pre@@ fer to carry forward the no@@ ble work of this great freedom figh@@ ter and other found@@ ers of our democracy .
These ide@@ als are shar@@ ed by vir@@ tually all of human@@ ity , as reflec@@ ted in the United Nations Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ als .
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ;
It points to system@@ ic we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in the criminal justice system , from investigation of cri@@ mes to rehabil@@ itation of off@@ end@@ ers .
This we should do every working day in the municipal offic@@ es , before the vo@@ ters rol@@ l is clo@@ sed .
It is these and other pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts who should take the gre@@ at@@ est share of the ac@@ col@@ ad@@ e when we pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce that â wh@@ at@@ ever economic stor@@ ms may p@@ ound our shor@@ es , wh@@ at@@ ever political un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties may visit our collec@@ tive con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness in a tran@@ si@@ tion â our n@@ ation is in a good state .
This rich her@@ it@@ age points to Africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of science and liter@@ at@@ ure , ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ y and comm@@ er@@ ce , inter@@ rup@@ ted by the sla@@ ve trade and the sc@@ ram@@ ble for Afric@@ as we@@ alth .
We also wish in this regard to congrat@@ ul@@ ate all our spor@@ ting team@@ s which have as@@ ser@@ ted South Afric@@ as pursu@@ it of excell@@ ence over the past year .
But let us not del@@ ude our@@ selves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its n@@ as@@ cent st@@ ages .
and we will be per@@ fec@@ tly jus@@ tified .
But I have dis@@ covered the sec@@ re@@ t that after cli@@ m@@ bing a great h@@ ill , one only fin@@ ds that there are many more h@@ ills to cli@@ m@@ b .
The ab@@ i@@ ding les@@ son from this experience is that we need str@@ ong@@ er partnerships among economic role players on a dom@@ estic and global scale , not only to st@@ em the impact of the cri@@ sis ;
This improv@@ ement is m@@ ir@@ ror@@ ed in access to basic services â a rap@@ id dec@@ line in as@@ set poverty even pre@@ ced@@ ed the dec@@ line in mone@@ y-@@ met@@ ric poverty .
O@@ ver these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mut@@ ual benefit to be ga@@ ined from our partnership .@@ We also wish to affir@@ m our commitment to the close relations that we have for@@ g@@ ed with B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and India through I@@ B@@ SA ;
But we are not in doub@@ t that that mom@@ ent will yet come so@@ on@@ er rather than later .
O@@ f course we do know that the dr@@ op@@ out rate particularly at secon@@ d@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary levels is un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high , and the educ@@ ational system has yet to produce the requ@@ is@@ ite kin@@ ds of skills needed by society .
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World C@@ up in 2@@ 0@@ 10 as well as the Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations C@@ up a few months from now .
On the one hand , plans to exp@@ and employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies will continue .
In@@ de@@ ed , government can be pr@@ ou@@ d that we have chang@@ ed the de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ic com@@ position of the public service , which in vir@@ tually all respec@@ ts appro@@ xim@@ ates the charac@@ ter of our society .
Your Ex@@ cel@@ len@@ cies , Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ ors and High Commission@@ ers and vi@@ si@@ ting foreign dign@@ it@@ aries ;
We may even say that , in a str@@ ange qu@@ ir@@ k of f@@ ate , many as@@ pec@@ ts of our constitutional order have been te@@ sted in the recent past ;@@ and every@@ one of them has passed the test to re@@ ve@@ al a democracy that is excep@@ tion@@ ally res@@ ili@@ ent .
In this lat@@ ter period , for the first time since the at@@ tain@@ ment of democracy , more job@@ s were being cre@@ ated than the number of new ent@@ ran@@ ts into the labour market , thu@@ s reducing the un@@ employment rate from 3@@ 1 in 200@@ 3 to 2@@ 3 in 200@@ 7 .
HIV imp@@ acts most sever@@ ely on young women .
In this regard , we wish to ac@@ knowledge On@@ kgop@@ ot@@ se Ti@@ ro@@ s c@@ ous@@ in , P@@ at Tlh@@ ag@@ wana .
These are challenges that our country will cer@@ tain@@ ly have to address going forward .
A hund@@ red and thir@@ ty years on , we can only mar@@ vel at the hope and the res@@ ili@@ ence that in@@ fu@@ sed those st@@ out hear@@ ts .
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , d@@ are not l@@ ing@@ er , for long wal@@ k is not yet ended .
In@@ de@@ ed , over the past 1@@ 5 years we have spar@@ ed no effor@@ t to ensure that Africa experi@@ ences her renew@@ al in what should in ac@@ tual practice be the African Cent@@ ury .
Deputy Speak@@ er and Deputy Chair@@ person of the National Council of Provinc@@ es ;
We hope that all political parties will , as they fin@@ alise their elec@@ tor@@ al li@@ sts , make their contribution to this no@@ ble en@@ de@@ av@@ our !
We shall also continue to pay special atten@@ tion to the challenge of anti@@ competi@@ tive behavi@@ our on the part of some of our corpor@@ ations .
In this regard , where necessary , we will find cre@@ ative ways to ra@@ ise funds .
driven by the des@@ ire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans .@@ As we look back over the past fi@@ f@@ te@@ en years , I wish to ac@@ knowledge the commitment and hard work of Presid@@ ents N@@ el@@ son Mandela and Tha@@ bo Mbe@@ ki and the many women and men who played their role in ste@@ ering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislat@@ ures across the three s@@ pher@@ es of government and the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary ;
and the following b@@ road categories of respon@@ ses are under discus@@ sion :
Y@@ et many health facilities do not always have the required medic@@ ines , appropriate staf@@ f@@ ing levels , and con@@ st@@ ant supply of basic services such as cle@@ an running water and electricity .
The sc@@ our@@ ge of crime remains a major sour@@ ce of in@@ security for South Africans .
I will ho@@ we@@ ver c@@ ite a few inst@@ ances again to s@@ ket@@ ch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face .
but it is expan@@ ding all the time , with over 6@@ 9@@ 0 00@@ 0 pati@@ ents having been initi@@ ated on anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment since the commen@@ c@@ ement of the programme .

In this regard , we have through legislation , international conven@@ tions , regul@@ ations and campaign@@ s ensu@@ red that con@@ cre@@ te efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with dis@@ ability and the el@@ der@@ ly .
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth should also include ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated implementation of affir@@ ma@@ tive action , including B@@ road@@ -based Black E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Em@@ power@@ ment .
We can con@@ dem@@ n the policies of governments which took their e@@ y@@ es off the b@@ all and allowed the rap@@ ac@@ ious licence of un@@ regul@@ ated market@@ s to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on financial systems .
In this regard , how we position our country to take advant@@ age of uni@@ que opportunities that have come our way , will be of par@@ amount importance .
The pre@@ val@@ ence of hun@@ g@@ er among children has vir@@ tually hal@@ ved over four years .
It is ap@@ t therefore to remin@@ d our@@ selves of that instruc@@ tive ob@@ servation of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence , continu@@ ity and change , by former President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , in his bi@@ ograph@@ y , L@@ ong W@@ al@@ k to Fre@@ edom :
and the level of in@@ equ@@ ality is too high .
as it is about consistent enforc@@ ement .
that we should inde@@ ed , in the words of the Fre@@ edom Char@@ ter , open ever wid@@ er the do@@ ors of learning and of cul@@ ture !
but from the point of view of government systems , we can dra@@ w sol@@ ace from the fact that over 7@@ 0 of cases of cor@@ ruption reported in the media become public because government has det@@ ected the wr@@ ong@@ doing and is in fact acting against it .
A@@ bo@@ ve all , I stand before you with pri@@ de and confi@@ dence that the South Africa we celeb@@ rate today â worl@@ ds apar@@ t from the divi@@ sions , conflict and exclu@@ sion of a m@@ ere 1@@ 5 years ago â is a product of the lab@@ ours and to@@ ils of South African women and men from all wal@@ ks of life .
And because we have a low sa@@ v@@ ings rate , we have had to rel@@ y on shor@@ t-@@ term capital flow@@ s to fin@@ ance the de@@ fic@@ it as well as our investment programmes .
W@@ e@@ alth is cre@@ ated in order to improve peop@@ les quality of life .
What we do know is that the regul@@ atory environment in our country and the counter@@ -@@ cyc@@ lic@@ al bud@@ get policies we adopted have hel@@ ped us avo@@ id the wor@@ st impact of the cri@@ sis .
The focus on mic@@ ro-@@ economic re@@ forms in the past dec@@ ad@@ e , and the efforts , especially since 200@@ 4 more syst@@ ema@@ tically to remove the variety of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to growth have had a positive impact .
Al@@ tern@@ atives to la@@ y@@ off@@ s will be expl@@ or@@ ed , including longer hol@@ id@@ a@@ ys , ext@@ ended training , short time and job@@ -@@ shar@@ ing .
O@@ f course , this should not det@@ r@@ act from our obli@@ gation to continue inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating the issue of the quality of these job@@ s , including the rights and benefits that workers enjo@@ y .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , we should not under@@ esti@@ mate the challenges we face .
We believe that the time has come to strengthen dom@@ estic regul@@ ation and super@@ vision of the financial system ;
Our economy remains larg@@ ely reli@@ ant on mining and agricul@@ ture for expor@@ ts .
I have tri@@ ed not to f@@ al@@ ter ;

Im@@ port@@ an@@ tly , shar@@ ing the benefits of growth should ent@@ a@@ il lab@@ our@@ -@@ ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , ensuring that there is dec@@ ent work .
It may as well be that the systems of pre@@ ven@@ ting and p@@ un@@ ishing cor@@ ruption are still in@@ adequ@@ ate ;
and South Africa stand@@ s ready to assist wh@@ er@@ ever we can .
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ;
Fir@@ stly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R@@ 6@@ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ bil@@ li@@ on for the next three years .
In this contex@@ t we also wish to ac@@ knowledge the l@@ ate E@@ phra@@ im Mo@@ gale , the foun@@ ding President 30 years ago of the Cong@@ res@@ s of South African St@@ ud@@ ents , and his pe@@ ers .

In@@ de@@ ed , in a period in which others are experi@@ encing or projec@@ ting rec@@ es@@ sions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a s@@ lower rate .
These include , in the first inst@@ ance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors .
integr@@ ating into the work of the relevant C@@ lu@@ sters the fin@@ dings of research on Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y interven@@ tions such as the community works programme , support for small and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses and rural development initiatives ;

While the number of grant benef@@ ici@@ aries was 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ -@@ milli@@ on in 199@@ 9 , by 200@@ 8 this had increased to 12@@ ,@@ 4@@ -@@ milli@@ on .

We have on coun@@ t@@ less occa@@ sions expres@@ sed our concern at the per@@ sist@@ ence of conflict in the Mid@@ d@@ le East in general and in Isra@@ el and Palestin@@ e in particular .
Is@@ su@@ ed by : The Presid@@ ency F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 200@@ 9
What , on the sur@@ face , started off as a financial cri@@ sis among a few len@@ ding institutions has explo@@ ded into a global credit c@@ run@@ ch , with sever@@ e consequ@@ ences for ac@@ tual production and trade .
It is prec@@ is@@ ely this we@@ ak@@ ness which accoun@@ ts for the large Cur@@ r@@ ent Ac@@ coun@@ t de@@ fic@@ it particularly when we entered higher rang@@ es of growth .
The same challenges con@@ front the private sector .
In this regard , we should sal@@ ute the l@@ ate President of the African National Cong@@ res@@ s , O@@ li@@ ver Reg@@ in@@ al@@ d T@@ am@@ bo , for initi@@ ating and p@@ il@@ o@@ ting through contin@@ ental and world bodi@@ es what became a comp@@ as@@ s for the peac@@ eful resolution of the conflict in our country .
But we do know that the reduc@@ tion has not been f@@ ast en@@ ough , not even at the 7@@ -@@ 10 rate that we set our@@ selves for various categories of contact crime .
In re@@ ality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is cer@@ tain@@ ly going to perform well below its ac@@ tual potential .
We do hope though that civil society will enh@@ ance its own level of acti@@ vis@@ m to ensure , among other th@@ ings , that as in@@ put pric@@ es dec@@ line , the benefit is fel@@ t by the population .
The leng@@ th of time towards at@@ taining a higher tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tor@@ y may have been stre@@ t@@ ched some@@ what .
O@@ ver@@ all , we are pr@@ ou@@ d of the adv@@ ances in our social programmes .
I stand before the people of South Africa with hum@@ ility at the opportunity I have had to occup@@ y the high@@ est office in the land as a consequ@@ ence of the uni@@ que circum@@ stance ar@@ ising out of the decision of the leading party in government to rec@@ all the former President .
That depend@@ s on all of us ;@@ and to that we can att@@ ach no pric@@ e !
It is South Afric@@ as people who have ensu@@ red its progress ;@@ and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come .
Nat@@ ur@@ ally , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties of a political tran@@ si@@ tion can pose more questions than there are currently answ@@ ers .
The dep@@ th of our dis@@ appointment at the recent es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict and mas@@ sive loss of life , of especially civili@@ ans â including children , women and the el@@ der@@ ly â inde@@ ed de@@ fi@@ es des@@ cription .

In the same meas@@ ure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursu@@ e these objectives in Bur@@ un@@ di , Sud@@ an , Western Sa@@ h@@ ara , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , Som@@ ali@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .

Sec@@ ond@@ ly , al@@ though the reduc@@ tions in poverty have been substan@@ tial , ag@@ g@@ reg@@ ate in@@ equ@@ ality increased during the 199@@ 0@@ s .
I thank you .
As such , we have been forced to t@@ one down our for@@ ec@@ ast@@ s in terms of growth and job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation .
to develop our rural areas and ensure food security ;
I am certain that Hon@@ our@@ able Members will ag@@ ree that the human@@ ity of our democratic disp@@ ens@@ ation should find expres@@ sion in the extent to which we pay atten@@ tion to the most vulner@@ able in society .
Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has some@@ what sh@@ el@@ tered us from the global economic stor@@ ms .
Govern@@ ments social programmes have also improved the as@@ set base of the poor , in the form of housing â with 2@@ ,@@ 6@@ -@@ milli@@ on subsi@@ di@@ sed hou@@ ses provided .
almost uni@@ vers@@ al access in terms of en@@ rol@@ ment at primary school level ;
It is ste@@ adi@@ ly growing str@@ ong@@ er .
We should of course ac@@ knowledge that the land re@@ distribution programme as well as po@@ st-@@ settle@@ ment support could have been hand@@ led fa@@ ster and better .
but be@@ y@@ ond this , that str@@ ong@@ er surve@@ ill@@ ance and action on a global scale have become un@@ avo@@ id@@ able and necessary .
and san@@ itation .
We are tr@@ uly hear@@ ten@@ ed that , yester@@ day , the Zimbab@@ we@@ an Parliament passed A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 1@@ 9 of the Constitution , la@@ ying the basis for the install@@ ation of an inclu@@ sive government .
With@@ in the g@@ ala@@ x@@ y of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the mis@@ fortun@@ e since last F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary to b@@ id the final f@@ are@@ well .
This is in part a consequ@@ ence of del@@ iber@@ ate programmes by government to exp@@ and public infrastructure .
Vi@@ ol@@ ence against women and children is much too high .
While that Con@@ vention defined the ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ial integr@@ ity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial op@@ pres@@ sion and exclu@@ sion .
We will as always se@@ ek to strengthen co@@ operation with these and other countries in pursu@@ it of that which is good for human@@ ity .
We know too that South Africa is less sever@@ ely affected than many other countries .
But we cannot satis@@ fy our@@ selves mer@@ ely with quanti@@ t@@ ative change .
In addition , tr@@ ends in performance , both in terms of teach@@ ing and learning , sho@@ w a wor@@ r@@ ying per@@ sist@@ ence of the social divi@@ sions of the past .
to under@@ sc@@ ore the responsibility that rest@@ s on our sh@@ oul@@ ders to adv@@ ance the ide@@ als that so many s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for , ref@@ using to be co@@ w@@ ed by set@@ bac@@ ks and hard@@ ships .
These difficul@@ ties have co@@ in@@ ci@@ ded with a period in which inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates are still too high .
It is ste@@ adi@@ ly growing str@@ ong@@ er , under@@ p@@ in@@ ned by a Constitution hard@@ ly equ@@ al@@ led in the world .
There is no ga@@ in@@ saying that , by any meas@@ ure , the progress made since 199@@ 4 has been im@@ pres@@ sive .
And yet human@@ ity today fac@@ es the dang@@ er that the at@@ tain@@ ment of these objectives could be post@@ pon@@ ed by many years , if not dec@@ ad@@ es , as a consequ@@ ence of the economic cri@@ sis that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the global v@@ ill@@ age .
On both coun@@ ts , the private sector is l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing far behind .
In@@ de@@ ed , the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of our political eng@@ ag@@ ement during this seas@@ on of elec@@ tor@@ al cont@@ est â which we all ag@@ ree should be dign@@ i@@ fied and peac@@ eful â is the su@@ rest guar@@ an@@ tee of the continued survi@@ val and deep@@ ening of our democracy .
As a consequ@@ ence , some of us may be mes@@ mer@@ ised by the tran@@ si@@ ent wa@@ ves of stor@@ my we@@ a@@ ther and hun@@ ch our sh@@ oul@@ ders in the face of these head@@ win@@ ds of economic tur@@ bul@@ ence and political tum@@ ul@@ t .
I am pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed to address the Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beg@@ in@@ ning of this last ses@@ sion of our Th@@ ir@@ d De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Parliament .
B@@ e it in education , health , housing , water or san@@ itation , the central question that con@@ fron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
and to inten@@ si@@ fy the fight against crime and cor@@ ruption .
We have in the past 1@@ 5 years done our best to att@@ ack this sc@@ our@@ ge through the social w@@ age .
But ne@@ i@@ ther can there be doub@@ t that the challenges remain im@@ men@@ se .
I am certain that we are all agreed that the well@@ being of our society depend@@ s , cri@@ tically , on the progress we make in expan@@ ding the n@@ ations we@@ alth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shar@@ ed by the people as a whole .
O@@ ver the years , we have ste@@ adi@@ ly improved the structures of govern@@ ance .
To these , I would also like to ad@@ d Ms Hel@@ en Su@@ z@@ man , a tr@@ uly distin@@ gu@@ ished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the cha@@ m@@ b@@ ers of the old .
Th@@ rou@@ gh adv@@ oc@@ acy campaign@@ s and inde@@ ed as a result of the partnerships we have buil@@ t with organisations re@@ presenting these vulner@@ able groups , we have improved awareness around issues that af@@ fect them ;@@ and progres@@ sively encouraged the main@@ stre@@ am@@ ing of these concer@@ ns .
It is a matter of pr@@ ou@@ d record that , for inst@@ ance , f@@ em@@ al@@ e-@@ head@@ ed house@@ holds have received a big@@ g@@ er-@@ than@@ -@@ a@@ ver@@ age share of the social w@@ age including housing and health care ;
But I can rest only for a mom@@ ent , for with freedom comes responsib@@ ilities , and I d@@ are not l@@ ing@@ er , for my long wal@@ k is not yet ended .
These South Africans re@@ present the hope and res@@ ili@@ ence that character@@ ise our n@@ ation .
On this we still have some way to go .
I c@@ ite these issues not because they are all@@ -@@ en@@ comp@@ as@@ sing n@@ or that by identi@@ fying them we would c@@ ure all the ills of our society .
Th@@ ose fe@@ ars and in@@ sec@@ uri@@ ties gave ri@@ se to dec@@ ad@@ es of re@@ sist@@ ance .
our Par@@ al@@ y@@ mp@@ i@@ ans continue to do us pr@@ ou@@ d ;
This initi@@ ative should sp@@ ur us on to act in concer@@ t with other countries on our continent and further a@@ field to better the human condi@@ tion .
and we are informed that all clin@@ ics now have access to pot@@ able water .
The global economic mel@@ t@@ down does pose serious dang@@ ers for our economy in terms of job los@@ ses and the quality of life of our people .
and even more re@@ mar@@ k@@ able , about 5@@ 00 00@@ 0 job@@ s a year between 200@@ 4 and 200@@ 7 .
With@@ in South Africa , it also informed the content of the 19@@ 8@@ 9 Confer@@ ence for a De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic F@@ ut@@ ure â br@@ ing@@ ing together pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts from vir@@ tually all wal@@ ks of life .
The partnership buil@@ t in the recent period between the lead@@ ership of the D@@ RC and R@@ wan@@ da holds out a prom@@ ise for adv@@ ances in matters of security and in dealing with the human@@ itarian cri@@ sis ;
These and other programmes , including the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities identified in the State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s last F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary , form the bed@@ ro@@ ck of our efforts to conclud@@ e the popul@@ ar man@@ date and la@@ y the found@@ ation for the future .
To qu@@ ote work conducted by a team of academ@@ ics at the Uni@@ versity of Stel@@ len@@ bos@@ ch , led by Prof@@ ess@@ or Ser@@ v@@ a@@ as van der B@@ er@@ g :
A@@ mong house@@ holds that include children , the number of house@@ holds repor@@ ting that a child went hun@@ gr@@ y dec@@ lin@@ ed dra@@ ma@@ tically between 200@@ 2 and 200@@ 6 .
The fact that incidents of viol@@ ent robber@@ ies in house@@ holds and busines@@ ses have been on the increase ;
All kin@@ ds of statistics can be c@@ ited to att@@ est to this .
We are confi@@ dent that , because it car@@ es , the international community will part@@ ner the people of Zimbabwe as they b@@ la@@ ze out along a new tra@@ il .
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , the dy@@ nam@@ ics under@@ lying the poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality tr@@ ends determine the b@@ road policy ou@@ tlo@@ ok poverty has dec@@ re@@ ased since the tran@@ si@@ tion , but in@@ equ@@ ality has not improved .
Ste@@ adi@@ ly but sur@@ ely , our continent is progres@@ sing towards her ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , with the interest of her people ri@@ sing to the top of their leaders ag@@ end@@ a , as@@ ser@@ ting her hope and her res@@ ili@@ ence on the world stage .
It is this , and this al@@ one , that has informed our per@@ sist@@ ence in assi@@ sting the people of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to the cri@@ sis in that country .
It is common cause that , after the economic st@@ ag@@ n@@ ation of the l@@ ate 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s and early 199@@ 0@@ s , South Africa has experi@@ enced the long@@ est period of susta@@ ined economic growth since the recor@@ ding of such statistics started in 19@@ 4@@ 0 .
D@@ ail@@ y experience , in poor and af@@ flu@@ ent neighbour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ali@@ ke , is one of ap@@ preh@@ en@@ sion at the pos@@ sibility of viol@@ ent att@@ ack .
That cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous ste@@ p to de@@ vi@@ se a framework that would se@@ ek peace and recon@@ cili@@ ation , in the place of wa@@ r and conflict , re@@ ver@@ sed for good the f@@ al@@ se da@@ w@@ n of a hund@@ red years ago : that is , the conclu@@ sion in 19@@ 0@@ 9 of the National Con@@ vention which pres@@ aged the formation of the Union of South Africa .
This is because of the transformation these institutions have under@@ gone , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights cul@@ ture , their de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ic com@@ position , and their systems of account@@ ability .
Our economy has become more open , and since 199@@ 4 it has ste@@ adi@@ ly become integrated into the global system .
Chil@@ d im@@ mun@@ isation cover@@ age has ste@@ adi@@ ly increased to about 8@@ 5 ;
In this respect , there is urg@@ ent need to assist in dealing with the human@@ itarian cri@@ sis in that country .
The mess@@ age of their her@@ o@@ ic de@@ eds r@@ ings tr@@ ue today as it did those many years ago , that we should together exp@@ and the fron@@ ti@@ ers of opportunity ;
This is larg@@ ely a result of mas@@ sive expan@@ sion in access to the Chil@@ d Sup@@ port G@@ r@@ ant , which increased from 3@@ 4@@ -@@ thous@@ and benef@@ ici@@ aries in 199@@ 9 to 8@@ ,@@ 1@@ -@@ milli@@ on in 200@@ 8 .
And we believe that , after five con@@ secu@@ tive win@@ s , the national s@@ occ@@ er team is now more confi@@ den@@ tly ge@@ aring itself to perform above exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations !
I have taken a mom@@ ent here to rest , to ste@@ al a view of the g@@ lor@@ ious vi@@ st@@ a that sur@@ r@@ ounds me , to look back on the di@@ stance I have come .
As such , the rate of growth in expor@@ ts has not been as high as in compar@@ able countries .
and the im@@ per@@ ative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elec@@ tions fin@@ ds a ready plat@@ form to imple@@ ment its programmes without un@@ due del@@ a@@ ys .
We look forward to further strength@@ ening this partnership when we host the South Afric@@ a-@@ EU Summit later this year .
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Hon@@ our@@ able Chair@@ person ;@@ Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Hon@@ our@@ able Chair@@ person ;
Both in the G@@ 2@@ 0 meetings and other inter@@ actions in multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions , our government has ar@@ gu@@ ed for appropriate and urg@@ ent interven@@ tions particularly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the cri@@ sis orig@@ inated and where it is most sever@@ e .
All this led to the negoti@@ ations process which cul@@ min@@ ated in our first democratic elec@@ tions in 199@@ 4 .
Now the work of re@@ construction can start in ear@@ n@@ est ;
We have buil@@ t a system of health@@ y inter@@ governmental relations across the s@@ pher@@ es , and improved integration within and among them .
Ra@@ ther , I have cho@@ sen to do so to empha@@ si@@ se the point that South Africa does not su@@ ff@@ er the poverty of vi@@ sions .
and inde@@ ed to the strength@@ ening bon@@ ds that our country has been for@@ g@@ ing with Rus@@ sia , and countries in A@@ sia , the Mid@@ d@@ le East , as well as L@@ ati@@ n and North Americ@@ a .
Si@@ x years ago , leaders of our people came together in a G@@ row@@ th and Development Summit and re@@ ached agreement on the t@@ as@@ ks all of us should under@@ take to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to hal@@ ve un@@ employment and poverty by 2@@ 0@@ 14 .
We can do all this ;
We are of course Ru@@ g@@ by World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons ;
and we do hope that the sp@@ iri@@ t which informed that eng@@ ag@@ ement will prev@@ a@@ il as we fin@@ alise the multi@@ lat@@ eral negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership Agre@@ ements with countries in our region .
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es need improv@@ ement .
V@@ ir@@ tually all the projects and plans are completed or near@@ ing comple@@ tion â from stadi@@ a , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommod@@ ation , to health and im@@ mig@@ ration plans â confir@@ ming the confi@@ dence of the global s@@ occ@@ er fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ity that ours will be a tr@@ uly successful t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent .
I should also take this opportunity to indic@@ ate that I will in the next few days conclud@@ e consult@@ ations with the Elec@@ tor@@ al Commission and the Provincial Premi@@ ers and ann@@ oun@@ ce the date of the elec@@ tions .
This is reflec@@ ted , among others , in legislation , rules and regul@@ ations govern@@ ing public serv@@ ants and political offic@@ e-@@ be@@ ar@@ ers ali@@ ke , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-@@ cor@@ ruption ho@@ tl@@ ines .
Spec@@ ial ac@@ col@@ ad@@ es are due to our c@@ ric@@ ket team which has cli@@ m@@ bed to the ape@@ x of global ran@@ k@@ ings .
As part of the many deta@@ iled projects contain@@ ed in the governments Program@@ me of Ac@@ tion , we will pay particular atten@@ tion to :
We can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of manag@@ ers of bi@@ g corpor@@ ations which pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the cri@@ sis .
O@@ f course , the overall crime rate , having peak@@ ed in 200@@ 2 , has consist@@ ently dec@@ lin@@ ed .
We still have a long way to go .
Min@@ e is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in comple@@ ting the man@@ date accor@@ ded the African National Cong@@ res@@ s in the 200@@ 4 elec@@ tions , and in la@@ ying the found@@ ation for the po@@ st-@@ election administration to h@@ it the ground running .
Fir@@ stly , mone@@ y-@@ met@@ ric poverty dec@@ lin@@ ed substan@@ ti@@ ally since the turn of the cent@@ ury .
We will inten@@ si@@ fy our efforts in@@ sp@@ ired by the en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m , the hope and the res@@ ili@@ ence of the South African people in pursu@@ it of that which is good for all of us .
Al@@ ong with other countries of the South we will continue to pursu@@ e the cause of the re@@ struc@@ turing of the United Nations , the International Mon@@ et@@ ary Fun@@ d and other multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions so they reflec@@ t the chang@@ ed and chang@@ ing global re@@ ality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transpar@@ ent manner .
Th@@ rou@@ gh that si@@ mp@@ le but prof@@ ound act of casting a bal@@ lot for a government of all the people of our country , we tur@@ ned our bac@@ ks on a past that de@@ human@@ ised us all .
This has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibility mas@@ sively to exp@@ and this programme and improve its quality .
Y@@ et , in being br@@ ut@@ ally self-@@ critical , we should not lo@@ se si@@ ght of the fact that what we are asses@@ sing is a system that enjo@@ ys , by far , better leg@@ iti@@ mac@@ y than ever experi@@ enced in our country .

We exten@@ d a special welcome to the Mandela famil@@ y. 
Com@@ pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts and friend@@ s, 
We are celeb@@ r@@ ating this day with former political prison@@ ers who we have speci@@ ally invited to jo@@ in us. 
President Bo@@ tha worked with the former Minister of J@@ us@@ tic@@ e, Mr Ko@@ bi@@ e Co@@ et@@ z@@ e@@ e, who was in turn assisted by Dr N@@ ei@@ l Bar@@ n@@ ard and Mr M@@ i@@ ke L@@ ou@@ w@@ . 
We welcome in particular those who have travel@@ led from ab@@ road to be her@@ e, Hel@@ ene P@@ ast@@ o@@ or@@ s, Mic@@ ha@@ el D@@ ing@@ ake from Bo@@ ts@@ wana, Mr An@@ di@@ m@@ ba To@@ i@@ v@@ o ya To@@ i@@ v@@ o of S@@ w@@ apo in Namib@@ ia. 
respon@@ ded with determination to the call to make the country un@@ govern@@ able and apartheid un@@ work@@ able. 
You will off course rec@@ all that the mas@@ ses of this country, in their different forma@@ tions, 
We are ple@@ ased to be jo@@ ined by members of the legal team in the Ri@@ v@@ on@@ ia T@@ reason tri@@ al â L@@ or@@ d Jo@@ el J@@ off@@ e, who is now based in Lond@@ on and J@@ ud@@ ge Ar@@ thu@@ r Cha@@ sk@@ al@@ s@@ on. 
They became a sym@@ bo@@ l of the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of many who b@@ ore the br@@ un@@ t of aparthe@@ id. 
It was he who initi@@ ated the discus@@ sion about the pos@@ sibility of the release of political prison@@ ers. 
These words in@@ sp@@ ire us not to rest until we achieve the ide@@ als of a society free of poverty and de@@ priv@@ ation. 
In th@@ is, President de K@@ ler@@ k demonstr@@ ated great cour@@ age and deci@@ sive lead@@ er@@ ship. 
His w@@ is@@ do@@ m was also dis@@ played in the Har@@ are Dec@@ lar@@ ation, which he w@@ ro@@ te and cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ed. 
During the course of this year@@ , we will mar@@ k the cent@@ en@@ ary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa, which was established in 19@@ 10@@ . 
who also called for Ma@@ di@@ ba@@ 's rele@@ a@@ se, as well as that of other political prison@@ ers and the return of ex@@ ile@@ s. 
Hon@@ our@@ able memb@@ ers, 
who la@@ id the found@@ ation for this country to become a sh@@ ining example of freedom and democrac@@ y. 
"@@ I stand before you, not as a prop@@ he@@ t but as a hum@@ ble serv@@ ant of you, the people. 
On this great day, let me also ac@@ knowledge the role played by the l@@ ate Ms Hel@@ en Su@@ z@@ man@@ . 
President Mandela un@@ ited this country behind the go@@ al of a non-@@ sex@@ ist@@ , non-@@ rac@@ i@@ al, democratic and pro@@ sp@@ erous South Africa. 
South Africa is yet to ac@@ knowledge in ful@@ l, the critical role played by the former President of the AN@@ C, Com@@ ra@@ de O@@ li@@ ver T@@ am@@ bo, 
I therefore place the re@@ ma@@ ining years of my life in your hand@@ s@@ .@@ " 
These mom@@ ents in our history demonstr@@ ate our ability to come toge@@ ther@@ , even under the most difficult of circum@@ stan@@ ces, and to put the countr@@ y's interests first above all other inter@@ est@@ s. 
It was his outstanding lead@@ er@@ ship, for@@ es@@ ight and cl@@ ar@@ ity of vision that led the ANC to inten@@ si@@ fy the pursu@@ it of a negoti@@ ated settle@@ ment. 
In the two dec@@ ad@@ es since the release of Ma@@ di@@ ba, our country has chang@@ ed fundament@@ ally. 
Your tir@@ el@@ ess and her@@ o@@ ic s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es have made it possible for me to be here today. 
This cre@@ ated a un@@ itary stat@@ e. 
As we mar@@ k this cent@@ en@@ ary later in the year@@ , we should reflec@@ t on how far we have travel@@ led as a country. 
S@@ ign@@ ific@@ an@@ tly, the exclu@@ sion of black people from this Union was one of the ch@@ ie@@ f reasons for the formation of the African National Cong@@ res@@ s in 19@@ 12@@ . 
De@@ ur sa@@ am te wer@@ k, k@@ an ons me@@ er ber@@ e@@ ik@@ . 
As we celeb@@ rate Ma@@ di@@ ba@@ 's release to@@ day, let us rec@@ omm@@ it our@@ selves to building a better future for all South African@@ s, black and wh@@ it@@ e. 
She was for a long time, a l@@ one vo@@ ice in Parliam@@ ent, calling for chang@@ e. 
We rec@@ all the words of Ma@@ di@@ ba on his rele@@ a@@ se, when he said and I qu@@ o@@ te@@ : 
It was this that la@@ id the gr@@ ound@@ work for the histor@@ ic announc@@ ements by President F@@ W de K@@ ler@@ k, 2@@ 0 years ago. 
We also recogn@@ ise the role of the leader of the In@@ ka@@ tha Fre@@ edom Par@@ ty, In@@ ko@@ si Man@@ go@@ su@@ th@@ u Bu@@ th@@ ele@@ z@@ i, 
We re@@ iter@@ ate our hear@@ t@@ fel@@ t gr@@ ati@@ t@@ ude to the international community for its un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ing support to our strugg@@ le. 
We congrat@@ ul@@ ate the overall win@@ ner@@ , Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te Le F@@ le@@ ur of Wor@@ c@@ est@@ er Sec@@ ond@@ ary School@@ , and all the particip@@ ants for the hard work. 
Two hund@@ red and si@@ x@@ ty six children from all provinces particip@@ ated in the pre-@@ State of the N@@ ation deb@@ ate on the role of the youth in the fight against pover@@ ty. 
In F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary last year@@ , government, busines@@ s, labour and community representatives agreed on a pack@@ age of measures to reduce the scale and impact of the cri@@ si@@ s. 
We called a jo@@ int sit@@ ting in the ev@@ ening so that the majority in our country, workers and school@@ children@@ , can be part of the occa@@ sion. 
Many of those who lo@@ st their job@@ s were the bre@@ ad@@ win@@ ners in poor fam@@ ili@@ es. 
L@@ ast year@@ , we experi@@ enced our first rec@@ es@@ sion in 1@@ 7 years. 
We are meeting against the back@@ dro@@ p of a global economic cri@@ si@@ s. 
The cri@@ sis cost our economy about 9@@ 00 00@@ 0 job@@ s. 
We have put many of these measures in plac@@ e. 
We have implemented deci@@ sive anti-@@ rec@@ es@@ sion sp@@ ending by government, especially on infra@@ structure. 
in which all persons live together in har@@ mon@@ y and with equ@@ al opportun@@ ities. 
Let us pursu@@ e the ide@@ al for which Ma@@ di@@ ba has f@@ ou@@ ght his entire life â the ide@@ al of a democratic and free societ@@ y, 
To ensure a safety cu@@ shi@@ on for the po@@ or, we brought social grant incre@@ ases for@@ war@@ d, and ext@@ ended the Chil@@ d-@@ Sup@@ port G@@ r@@ ant to children over 14 years of age. 
We are im@@ pres@@ sed by the en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m of the youth about the occa@@ sion. 
Un@@ employment rates for young people are substan@@ ti@@ ally higher than the a@@ ver@@ age. 
Government will therefore not with@@ dra@@ w its support measu@@ res. 
It is too so@@ on, thou@@ gh@@ , to be certain of the p@@ ace of recover@@ y. 
Es@@ ko@@ m will continue to build additional gener@@ ation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power st@@ ations. 
These are job opportunities cre@@ ated to provide un@@ employed people with an in@@ com@@ e, work experience and training opportun@@ ities. 
We have identified some areas of improv@@ ement, which we will effect going for@@ war@@ d, including ensuring more lab@@ our@@ -@@ inten@@ sive projec@@ ts. 
Our rural development programme will improve rural produc@@ tiv@@ ity, and the lives of people living in rural areas. 
To ensure the promotion of an inclu@@ sive econom@@ y, to a@@ id growth and development, we have established the 
O@@ ver the next three year@@ s, government will sp@@ end R@@ 8@@ 4@@ 6 bil@@ li@@ on on public infra@@ structure. 
The job@@ s are in areas like construc@@ tion, home and commun@@ ity-@@ based car@@ e, and environmental projec@@ ts. 
In the next three year@@ s, an additional two milli@@ on children from poor famil@@ ies and house@@ hol@@ ds, aged 1@@ 5 to 1@@ 8 year@@ s, 
A further expan@@ sion of public employment programmes is also under@@ way. 
The most urg@@ ent focus of policy change must be interven@@ tions to create job@@ s for young people. 
The n@@ ation will rec@@ all that during the 200@@ 9 State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s, I announc@@ ed that the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me would create 5@@ 00 00@@ 0 work opportunities by Dec@@ ember 200@@ 9@@ . 
We are grat@@ eful for the sp@@ iri@@ t of famil@@ y, community and volun@@ t@@ ary work that in@@ sp@@ i@@ res many people to help those most affected by the cri@@ si@@ s, through these difficult tim@@ es. 
Our Indu@@ stri@@ al Polic@@ y Ac@@ tion Pl@@ an and our new focus on gre@@ en job@@ s, will build str@@ ong@@ er and more lab@@ our@@ -@@ ab@@ sor@@ bing industri@@ es. 
On transpor@@ t, we will maintain and exp@@ and our road net@@ work. 
E@@ con@@ om@@ ic indic@@ ators sugg@@ est that we are now tur@@ ning the cor@@ ner. 
A@@ mong other th@@ ing@@ s, this will look at the participation of independent power produc@@ ers, and protec@@ ting the poor from ri@@ sing electricity pric@@ es. 
We will establish an independent system oper@@ ator@@ , separate from Es@@ ko@@ m Hol@@ ding@@ s.

We are ple@@ ased to ann@@ oun@@ ce that by the end of Dec@@ emb@@ er, we had cre@@ ated more than 4@@ 8@@ 0 00@@ 0 public works job opportun@@ ities, which is 9@@ 7@@ % of the targ@@ et we had se@@ t. 
Pr@@ opo@@ s@@ als will be tab@@ led to subsi@@ di@@ se the cost of h@@ iring youn@@ g@@ er work@@ ers, to encourage fir@@ ms to take on in@@ experi@@ enced staf@@ f@@ . 
Government introduc@@ ed a â@@ @@ training la@@ y-@@ off sch@@ eme@@ â@@  to allow workers the op@@ tion of a period of training in@@ ste@@ ad of re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment. 
Our long-term infrastructure programme will help us g@@ row fa@@ ster@@ . 
Now is the time to la@@ y the gr@@ ound@@ work for str@@ ong@@ er growth going for@@ war@@ d, and for growth that gives ri@@ se to more job@@ s. 
We will ensure that our ra@@ il net@@ work is reli@@ able, competi@@ tive and better integrated with our sea por@@ ts. 
Our education and skills programmes will increase our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and competi@@ ti@@ ven@@ es@@ s. 
These efforts were enh@@ anced by our Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me. 
Un@@ der@@ p@@ in@@ ning our strategy for economic rec@@ o@@ very and grow@@ th, is our capital investment programme. 
E@@ con@@ om@@ ic activity is ri@@ sing in South Africa, and we exp@@ ect growth going for@@ war@@ d. 
We know that these and other measures cannot fully m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate the effec@@ ts of the rec@@ es@@ sion. 
will benefit from the Chil@@ d-@@ Sup@@ port G@@ ran@@ t. 
The labour statistics rele@@ ased on Tu@@ es@@ day, sho@@ w that the economy is now cre@@ ating job@@ s rather than she@@ d@@ ding them. 
To ensure reli@@ able power sup@@ pl@@ y, we have established an Inter@@ -@@ Minist@@ erial Committee on E@@ ner@@ g@@ y, to develop a 2@@ 0@@ -@@ year integrated resource plan@@ . 
hom@@ e-@@ based car@@ e, school maintenance and early child@@ ho@@ od development initiativ@@ es. 
This year@@ , 2@@ 0@@ 10@@ , shall be a year of ac@@ tion. 
We are building a performan@@ c@@ e-@@ ori@@ ented stat@@ e, by improv@@ ing planning as well as performance monitoring and evalu@@ ation. 
When this administration came into office last year@@ , we under@@ took to work har@@ der to build a strong develop@@ mental stat@@ e. 
This includes local infrastructure and ter@@ ti@@ ary projects and liter@@ acy projec@@ ts, 
We said it would be a state that respon@@ ds to the needs and asp@@ ir@@ ations of the peop@@ le, and which per@@ forms better and fa@@ ster@@ . 
L@@ ast year we launched the National Y@@ ou@@ th Development Ag@@ ency. 
The defin@@ ing feat@@ ure of this administration will be that it know@@ s where people li@@ ve, under@@ stand@@ s their needs and respon@@ ds fa@@ ster@@ . 
We will exp@@ ect the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this vi@@ sion. 
We have direc@@ ted the ag@@ ency to work fa@@ ster to establish its structu@@ res, throughout the country, so that it can assist us to main@@ stre@@ am youth development programmes within government. 
Government must work fa@@ ster@@ , har@@ der and s@@ mar@@ ter. 
We are therefore making interven@@ tions to lower mat@@ er@@ n@@ al mor@@ t@@ ality rat@@ es, to reduce new HIV infec@@ tions and to effec@@ tively tre@@ at HIV and tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ o@@ si@@ s. 
Our education targ@@ ets are si@@ mp@@ le but cri@@ tic@@ al. 
re@@ affir@@ ming their commitment to the Qu@@ ality Le@@ ar@@ ning and Te@@ aching Cam@@ pa@@ ign from the beg@@ in@@ ning of 2@@ 0@@ 10@@ . 
We welcome last month@@ 's statement by the three teach@@ er uni@@ on@@ s, N@@ AP@@ T@@ O@@ SA@@ , SAD@@ T@@ U and SA@@ O@@ U@@ , 
We will assist teach@@ ers by providing deta@@ iled da@@ ily les@@ son plan@@ s. 
We will continue to improve our health@@ care system. 
We will take further our work to reduce serious and viol@@ ent cri@@ m@@ es, and ensure that the justice system works effici@@ en@@ tly. 
We will under@@ take a number of key activities towards the achiev@@ ement of these out@@ com@@ es. 
Un@@ less we do th@@ is, we will not improve the quality of educ@@ ation. 
We must con@@ front the fact that life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ancy at bir@@ th, has dr@@ op@@ ped from 6@@ 0 years in 199@@ 4 to just below 50 years today. 
As you are awar@@ e, we are committed to five prior@@ iti@@ es@@ : 
We are working hard to ensure that every@@ one in South Africa fe@@ els safe and is saf@@ e. 
The work of departments will be measu@@ red by out@@ com@@ es, developed through our performance monitoring and evaluation system. 
From this year on@@ war@@ ds, all gra@@ de 3@@ , 6 and 9 
We must also increase the number of youth who enter learner@@ ships in the private and public sector@@ s.

This will be recor@@ ded in an au@@ dit@@ able written re@@ port@@ . 
The minist@@ ers who are responsible for a particular out@@ com@@ e, will sign a deta@@ iled delivery agreement with the Presid@@ ent. 
We have placed education and skills development at the centre of this govern@@ ment's polic@@ ies.

We are working with higher education institutions to ensure that el@@ ig@@ ib@@ le students obtain financial assi@@ st@@ ance, through the National St@@ ud@@ ent Fin@@ ancial A@@ id Sch@@ em@@ e. 
We are ple@@ ased to ann@@ oun@@ ce a new way of doing th@@ ings in government. 
A@@ no@@ ther key out@@ come is to ensure a long and health@@ y life for all South African@@ s.

We are also collabor@@ ating with the D@@ B@@ SA and the Indu@@ stri@@ al Development Cor@@ por@@ ation, in a public@@ -@@ private partnership programme to improve hospit@@ als and provide fin@@ ance for projec@@ ts. 
It will ou@@ tl@@ ine what is to be don@@ e, ho@@ w@@ , by wh@@ om@@ , within what time period and using what measu@@ re@@ ments and resourc@@ es. 
In@@ ten@@ sive work is under@@ way to ensure that this work is on sche@@ du@@ le. 
We ur@@ ge parents to co@@ operate with us in making this a succes@@ s. 
We have also set am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous targ@@ ets for skills development, to produce additional engine@@ ers and techn@@ ici@@ an@@ s, and to increase the number of quali@@ fied Ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and Sci@@ ence teach@@ ers. 
In addi@@ tion, we will work to improve the effec@@ tiveness of local government, infrastructure development and human settle@@ ments. 
In our 2@@ 0@@ 10 program@@ me, we want to improve the ability of our children to read@@ , wr@@ ite and coun@@ t in the found@@ ation years. 
To stud@@ ents, we will provide eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use work@@ book@@ s in all 1@@ 1 langu@@ ag@@ es. 
This includes building and upgra@@ ding hospit@@ als and clin@@ ic@@ s, and further improv@@ ing the working conditions of health@@ care work@@ ers. 
We therefore plan to increase the training of 1@@ 6@@ -@@ 2@@ 5 year ol@@ ds in further education and training facil@@ ities. 
We will also continue prepar@@ ations for the establishment of a national health in@@ sur@@ ance system. 
We aim to increase the number of mat@@ ric students who are el@@ ig@@ ib@@ le for uni@@ versity ad@@ mission to 1@@ 7@@ 5 00@@ 0 a year by 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 4@@ . 
This will enable us to provide a second ch@@ ance at educ@@ ation, for those who do not quali@@ fy for uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y. 
students will wr@@ ite liter@@ acy and num@@ er@@ acy te@@ sts that are in@@ depend@@ ently moder@@ ated. 
We want learners and teach@@ ers to be in school@@ , in clas@@ s, on time, learning and teach@@ ing for seven h@@ ours a day.

A number of issues have already received atten@@ tion. 
We re@@ iter@@ ate that there are no gri@@ ev@@ ances that can jus@@ tify violence and the de@@ struc@@ tion of proper@@ ty. 
Let us participate in community safety for@@ um@@ s. 
We are working to upgra@@ de well-@@ located informal settle@@ ments and provide proper service and land ten@@ ure to at least 5@@ 00 00@@ 0 house@@ holds by 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 4@@ . 
This provided valu@@ able in@@ si@@ ght into the challenges in local government. 
During this year of ac@@ tion, let us work together to make local government every@@ bo@@ d@@ y's busines@@ s. 
After the Bal@@ four vis@@ it, we sent a n@@ in@@ e-@@ member minist@@ erial team to visit the area to address the issues that had been raised by the community. 
Let us always be ready to provide the police with information about criminal activ@@ ity.

We must today rene@@ w our ple@@ dge , to spe@@ ak together of freedom , to act in partnership to re@@ alise the happ@@ iness for all that should come with liber@@ ty , 
We have gather@@ ed here today , on Fre@@ edom D@@ ay , because in time , our people , together with the bil@@ li@@ ons of human be@@ ings across the glo@@ be , 
For too long our country contain@@ ed within it and represented much that is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society 
Fi@@ f@@ ty years before , as they prepared to con@@ v@@ ene the Cong@@ res@@ s of the Pe@@ op@@ le , which adopted the Fre@@ edom Char@@ ter , 
conven@@ ed at our se@@ at of government the Union Bu@@ il@@ dings in Tsh@@ wane on Fre@@ edom D@@ ay

The work to create that South Africa has be@@ gu@@ n .

We must continue to respon@@ d to the per@@ spec@@ tive we spok@@ e of as the present government beg@@ an its term of office , 
was to enjo@@ y safety and security because to be safe was to be protec@@ ted by high wal@@ ls , 
We are gre@@ at@@ ly encouraged that our General Elec@@ tions of a for@@ t@@ night ago confir@@ med the determination of all our people , 
reflec@@ ted on the fact that its meeting mar@@ ked the mid@@ -@@ term of the life of the government born of our last , 200@@ 4 , elec@@ tions . 
who are our com@@ ra@@ des@@ -@@ in-@@ arms and whom our distin@@ gu@@ ished gu@@ ests re@@ present , dec@@ ided to say â an end to all that ! 
to promote the growth of the small and medi@@ um business sector ; 
the pat@@ ri@@ o@@ ts of the day had said , Let us spe@@ ak together , all of us together â 
N@@ one of the great social problems we have to sol@@ ve is cap@@ able of resolution outside the contex@@ t of the cre@@ ation of job@@ s and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of poverty . 
With your indu@@ l@@ g@@ ence , I would like to ste@@ p further back , and rec@@ all what we said , in 200@@ 4 
and the alle@@ vi@@ ation and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effor@@ t to build the new South Africa . 
and woo@@ ded l@@ an@@ es , and flow@@ ers b@@ los@@ s@@ om@@ s off@@ setting the gre@@ en and sing@@ ing gr@@ as@@ s , 
elec@@ tri@@ fied f@@ ences , gu@@ ard do@@ g@@ s , police pat@@ rol@@ s and military regi@@ ments ready to def@@ end those who were our ma@@ sters , 
This rel@@ ates to every@@ thing , from the improv@@ ement of the health of our people , to reducing the levels of crime , 
And of the happ@@ iness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
That work will continue during our Sec@@ ond Dec@@ ad@@ e of Fre@@ edom . 
fully con@@ sci@@ ous that n@@ one of the great social problems we have to sol@@ ve is cap@@ able of resolution outside the contex@@ t of the cre@@ ation of job@@ s 
H@@ av@@ ing under@@ st@@ ood this , it was natural that we should put the question to our@@ selves â 
, as I have been pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed to do in previous years , was formed in 200@@ 4 , after the General Elec@@ tions of that year . 
to increase sp@@ ending on scientific research and development ; 
At an a@@ ver@@ age of over 4@@ ,@@ 5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its high@@ est since we at@@ tained our democracy in 199@@ 4 . 
I am happ@@ y to report that with regard to each of these commit@@ ments , government remains hard at work to ensure that the n@@ ations objectives are me@@ t . 
Inv@@ est@@ ment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 1@@ 1 
Y@@ et we must remain concerned that these fi@@ gu@@ res are still wo@@ eful@@ ly low . 
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation ; 
The mas@@ sive and susta@@ ined increase in consu@@ mer dem@@ and reflec@@ ts a health@@ y growth in levels of pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity across the population ; 
To@@ day , fi@@ xed investment as a per@@ cent@@ age of G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Pro@@ duc@@ t â at about 1@@ 8@@ ,@@ 4 â is at its high@@ est since 199@@ 1 . 
increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peop@@ les of the world . 
to improve our export performance , foc@@ us@@ sing on services and manufac@@ tu@@ red goods ; 
and the prop@@ or@@ tion of B@@ l@@ ac@@ ks in top management has grow@@ n from 2@@ 4 of the total to 2@@ 7 . 
to improve the health prof@@ ile of the n@@ ation as a whole ; 
From own@@ ing just over 3 of the market capit@@ alisation of the J@@ S@@ E in 200@@ 4 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; 
to inten@@ si@@ fy the housing programme ; 
The adv@@ ances in the economy have th@@ row@@ n up major challenges for all of us . 
to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the process of renew@@ al of the African continent ; 
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person ; 
, with overall public sector infrastructure sp@@ ending increasing by an ann@@ ual a@@ ver@@ age of 1@@ 5@@ ,@@ 8 . 
But our international trade bal@@ ance show@@ s that we have not suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in building the capacity to produce the consu@@ mer and capital goods that our country needs . 
We have seen ste@@ ad@@ y progress in the adv@@ anc@@ ement of Black people in the economy . 
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ; 
to imple@@ ment additional measures to open wid@@ er the do@@ ors of learning and of cul@@ ture ; 
to ensure that the public sector dis@@ charges its responsib@@ ilities as a critical play@@ er in the growth , re@@ construction and development of our country ; 
to imple@@ ment programmes to ensure broad@@ -based black economic em@@ power@@ ment ; 
to imple@@ ment deta@@ iled programmes to respon@@ d to the challenges of the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y ; 
The number of employed people has been increasing at about hal@@ f@@ -@@ a-@@ milli@@ on a year in the past three years . 
and the major infrastructure projects that we are emb@@ ar@@ king on dem@@ and mas@@ sive in@@ put of sup@@ pl@@ ies and machin@@ ery . 
to exp@@ and access to such services as water , electricity and san@@ itation ; 
to provide economic services to create more job@@ s and business opportunities . 
around which fe@@ a@@ sibility work has started , the K@@ lip@@ fontein Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or in Cape Town and the Gaut@@ ra@@ in project with its lin@@ k@@ ages to the rest of the public transport system . 
The housing programme has seen close to 3@@ 00 00@@ 0 new subsi@@ dies allocated in the past two years . 
It is encour@@ aging that the rates of increase in up@@ take have , in the recent period , been within manag@@ e@@ able rang@@ es , as the programmes re@@ ach mat@@ urity . 
as the National Y@@ ou@@ th Service and the development of young entreprene@@ ur@@ s . 
in respect of basic water supply , with improv@@ ement of access from 5@@ 9 in 199@@ 4 to 8@@ 3 in 200@@ 6 . 
These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passeng@@ er transport strategy , comb@@ ining both road and ra@@ il . 
It is a matter of pri@@ de that , in line with our commitment to build a car@@ ing society , we have since 200@@ 4 
This will ensure sustain@@ ability , and employment of more government resources 
While benef@@ ici@@ aries of social gr@@ ants number@@ ed about 8 milli@@ on in 200@@ 4 , 
Accor@@ ding to the United Nations Development Program@@ me , South Africa is one of the few countries that sp@@ end less on military budget@@ s than on water and san@@ itation . 
O@@ ver the past three years , the economy has cre@@ ated some one-@@ and-@@ half milli@@ on job@@ s . 
While household deb@@ t has increased broad@@ ly at the same rate as growth in income , 
It is encour@@ aging that in the year Mar@@ ch 200@@ 5 to Mar@@ ch 200@@ 6 al@@ one , 
The continu@@ ing occa@@ sional vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity of our curr@@ ency has also not bo@@ ded well for our export industri@@ es . 
We must act to change this situation . 
And given that a large majority of the un@@ employed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interven@@ tions 
These include the taxi rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the M@@ olo@@ to Ra@@ il Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or in Mpumal@@ anga 
Ac@@ cess to electricity , water and san@@ itation has improved . 
We will attend to the urg@@ ent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
3@@ 00 00@@ 0 of the job@@ s cre@@ ated were in the formal sector outside of agricul@@ ture , re@@ presenting a growth rate of about 4 . 
But there is no question that this programme can and must be rat@@ ch@@ et@@ ed up@@ wards quite signific@@ an@@ tly . 
by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the p@@ ace of roll@@ -@@ out has been much s@@ lower than we expected . 
As Hon@@ our@@ able members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implemen@@ ting various programmes aimed at improv@@ ing passeng@@ er transport . 
the fact that South Africans are sa@@ ving less means that we have to dep@@ end on sa@@ v@@ ings from other n@@ ations . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , as we sou@@ ght to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being mis@@ sed 
improved service provision and other as@@ pec@@ ts of the social w@@ age . 
today 1@@ 1 milli@@ on poor South Africans have access to these gr@@ ants . 
B@@ y 200@@ 5 , South Africa had already achiev@@ ed the Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ al 
In the words of the UN@@ DP Human Development Re@@ port of 200@@ 6 : 
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities cre@@ ated through the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me . 
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-@@ employment through small and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses . 
De@@ velop a proper data@@ base of house@@ holds living in poverty ; 
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African W@@ om@@ en in Di@@ alogu@@ e working with various government departments , 
We also continue to sho@@ w we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in implemen@@ ting the A@@ dul@@ t Ba@@ sic Education programme . 
including a visit to countries such as T@@ uni@@ sia and Ch@@ ile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , 
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other th@@ ings : 
The flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating Mat@@ ric pas@@ s rates do indic@@ ate that much more needs to be done 
Many more are without electricity and san@@ itation . 
Mon@@ it@@ or progress in these house@@ holds as the programmes take effect in gra@@ du@@ ating them out of poverty ; 
We will continue to con@@ front these challenges so as to er@@ ase in our country 
We are on course to put an end to this de@@ human@@ ising system in these areas by the end of this year . 
At the same time , the number of Mat@@ ric students who pas@@ s Ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics at the higher gra@@ de is only s@@ ligh@@ tly better than in 199@@ 5 . 
A critical le@@ g of these social interven@@ tions should be the inten@@ si@@ fication of jo@@ int efforts among all South Africans to improve social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on . 
We should inde@@ ed celeb@@ rate this great achiev@@ ement . 
While the land re@@ stitution programme has resul@@ ted in more settle@@ ments in the recent period , 
In the mean@@ time , we will continue to expl@@ ore new initiatives which will progres@@ sively improve the social w@@ age . 
Def@@ ine clear@@ ly the poverty mat@@ ri@@ x of our country ; 
An exam@@ ination of education and skills acqu@@ isi@@ tion show@@ s improv@@ ement of quite a high base by 200@@ 4 , though at a s@@ low p@@ ace . 
This applies to liter@@ acy levels , g@@ ross school en@@ rol@@ ment and ter@@ ti@@ ary participation rates . 
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strateg@@ ies to reduce and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the poverty that continues to af@@ f@@ lic@@ t many of our people . 
On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land re@@ distribution . 
Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the training of F@@ am@@ ily Social Wor@@ k@@ ers at professional and au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary levels to ensure that identified house@@ holds are proper@@ ly suppor@@ ted and monit@@ or@@ ed . 
that which is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive so that together we can spe@@ ak of freedom and the happ@@ iness that comes with liber@@ ty . 
This will ensure the syst@@ ema@@ tic lin@@ k@@ age of benef@@ ici@@ aries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities 
does point to some de@@ fec@@ ts in our systems in this regard . 
C@@ o-@@ ordin@@ ate and al@@ ign all anti-@@ poverty programmes to maxim@@ ise impact and avo@@ id wast@@ age and du@@ plic@@ ation ; 
In this contex@@ t , address all indig@@ ence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
But it is a fact that 8 milli@@ on people are still without pot@@ able water . 
Identi@@ fy and imple@@ ment specific interven@@ tions relevant to these house@@ holds ; 
we still need to put in ex@@ tr@@ a effor@@ t in dealing with re@@ ma@@ ining cases , many of which are much more comple@@ x . 
to stab@@ ili@@ se the system and ensure ste@@ ad@@ y improv@@ ement . 
We are pr@@ ou@@ d that within one year , we have been able to reduce the back@@ lo@@ g in the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of the bu@@ c@@ ket system in established settle@@ ments by almost half . 
, continu@@ ously foc@@ used on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible gra@@ du@@ ate out of depend@@ ence on social gr@@ ants and enter the labour market . 
We will under@@ take a car@@ eful review of the in@@ hib@@ iting fac@@ tors so that this programme is urg@@ ently spe@@ ed@@ ed up . 
Qu@@ ite clear@@ ly the regul@@ atory system that we have in place is in@@ adequ@@ ate . 
Ob@@ vi@@ ously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correc@@ t ob@@ servation that audi@@ ting requirements at national and provincial levels have become more str@@ ing@@ ent . 
We will also continue to put more effor@@ t into improv@@ ing the function@@ ing of our courts , to increase the rate of reduc@@ tion in case back@@ log@@ s . 
and while we have improved the training programme , we recogn@@ ise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high en@@ ough for every@@ body to fe@@ el a better sen@@ se of safety and security . 
While we have already sur@@ passed that target@@ ed fi@@ g@@ ure of 1@@ 5@@ 2 00@@ 0 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , 
and the over@@ ar@@ ching sen@@ se of bel@@ ong@@ ing to South Africa needs to be better can@@ v@@ as@@ sed across society , in a manner that strength@@ ens our unity as a n@@ ation . 
And we will ensure that decisions to exp@@ and the Cor@@ rec@@ tional Services infrastructure , 
and the role of the SA Management Development In@@ stitute which in ac@@ tual fact should be the major service provi@@ der including in the mas@@ s in@@ duc@@ tion of public serv@@ ants . 
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , we must continue and further inten@@ si@@ fy the struggle against crime . 
with special atten@@ tion to the various forms of violence to which women are subjec@@ ted 
in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Provin@@ ce , the vac@@ ancy rate at senior management level was over 50 ; 
In this year of the 6@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the Doc@@ tors P@@ act of leaders of African and Indi@@ an communities , the 3@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the murder of Ste@@ ve B@@ ik@@ o 
clo@@ se@@ ted behind wal@@ ls and bar@@ bed w@@ ire , ever an@@ x@@ ious in their hou@@ ses , on the stre@@ ets and on our roads , un@@ able fre@@ ely to enjo@@ y our public spac@@ es . 
improve the management of Bor@@ der Cont@@ rol as well as the im@@ mig@@ ration and docu@@ mentation services , among others , are implemented . 
Im@@ medi@@ ately after the Mar@@ ch 200@@ 6 local government elec@@ tions , in@@ duc@@ tion programmes were conducted , taking into account that 6@@ 2 of the ma@@ y@@ ors are new . 
Many of the we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in improv@@ ing services to the population der@@ i@@ ve in part from in@@ adequ@@ ate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
And the abuse of women and children continues at an un@@ accep@@ table level . 
F@@ ur@@ ther , on this the 3@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the ban@@ ning of The World and The W@@ e@@ ek@@ end World new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , we are du@@ t@@ y-@@ b@@ ound to ask the question - 
and work to at@@ tain the happ@@ iness that comes with it . 
This applies to such issues as w@@ age levels , personnel v@@ et@@ ting systems , enforc@@ ement of guidel@@ ines on cas@@ h@@ -@@ delivery vehicles , and so on . 
have we all fully intern@@ alised our responsibility in building social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on and promo@@ ting a common sen@@ se of bel@@ ong@@ ing , 
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is cru@@ cial . 
Program@@ mes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue ap@@ ace . 
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vac@@ an@@ cies remain or have emerg@@ ed in senior management and the profes@@ sions . 
In other words , measures required to improve social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on cannot be under@@ taken by government al@@ one . 
and the 2@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the visit to D@@ ak@@ ar by Afri@@ kan@@ er intellec@@ tu@@ als to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of identi@@ ties 
While we have reduc@@ ed the incid@@ ence of most contact cri@@ mes , 
Dec@@ i@@ sive action will be taken to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate law@@ les@@ s@@ ness , drug tra@@ ffic@@ king , gu@@ n running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
The increase in the incid@@ ence of particular cri@@ mes during the security workers stri@@ ke should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be hand@@ led sim@@ ply as a private af@@ fair of the private sector . 
In the 199@@ 4 R@@ DP Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er we said : 
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improv@@ ing the work of the police , 
What has emerg@@ ed , among others , as a critical area for strategic inter@@ vention is the content of training that public serv@@ ants receive in various institutions 
we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the public , in which hu@@ ge resources are exp@@ ended , are actually me@@ t . 
and in Mpumal@@ anga only 1 of senior manag@@ ers had conclud@@ ed Ke@@ y Per@@ forman@@ ce Agre@@ ements . 
For inst@@ ance , in Sep@@ t@@ ember last year , 2@@ 7 of municipalities did not have municipal manag@@ ers ; 
Pe@@ ace and political st@@ ability are also central to the governments efforts to create an en@@ abl@@ ing environment to encourage investment 
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , we cannot er@@ ase that which is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive and cla@@ im the happ@@ iness that comes with freedom if communities live in fe@@ ar , 
rein@@ forc@@ ing the g@@ lu@@ e that holds our n@@ ation together ! 
the ann@@ ual reduc@@ tion rate with regard to such categories as robber@@ y , assaul@@ t and murder is still below the 7@@ -@@ 10 that we had target@@ ed . 
It will build on and exp@@ and the national dri@@ ve for peace and com@@ bat the end@@ em@@ ic violence fac@@ ed by communities 
We must together as South Africans spe@@ ak of freedom from want and from mor@@ al dec@@ ay , 
P@@ rom@@ o@@ ting peace and security will invol@@ ve all people . 
I am certain that we shall all ag@@ ree that working together to achieve the happ@@ iness that comes with freedom applies equ@@ ally to the challenge of dealing with crime . 
As such , in the period leading up to 200@@ 9 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our ag@@ end@@ a . 
Com@@ pli@@ ance levels within departments , in rel@@ ation to public service and fin@@ ance management legislation , have been some@@ what mi@@ xed . 
These p@@ il@@ ot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
The programme to al@@ ign planning instru@@ ments across the s@@ pher@@ es of government is continu@@ ing , 
informed by our Fi@@ ve Y@@ e@@ ar Local Government Str@@ ateg@@ ic Ag@@ end@@ a , which includes hand@@ s-@@ on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures , 
I would like to take advant@@ age of this occa@@ sion to expres@@ s my gr@@ ati@@ t@@ ude to Deputy President Ph@@ um@@ z@@ ile M@@ lam@@ bo@@ -@@ Ng@@ cu@@ ka 
We highly appreci@@ ate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service manag@@ ers , across the three s@@ pher@@ es of government , in leading this process and in implemen@@ ting the government programme as a whole . 
working with the Ministers and Premi@@ ers who con@@ stitute the T@@ ask Te@@ am , 
This is central to our efforts to er@@ ase that which is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in our society so that we can spe@@ ak of freedom and the happ@@ iness that comes with liber@@ ty . 
for the in@@ sp@@ iring lead@@ ership she has given to the implementation of the Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and S@@ har@@ ed G@@ row@@ th In@@ iti@@ ative , 
We continue to respon@@ d to these challenges and will under@@ take all necessary t@@ as@@ ks ,

This will la@@ y the basis for co@@ operation among all social partners in spe@@ eding up local economic development .

It is a matter of pr@@ ou@@ d record that over half of the di@@ stric@@ ts and met@@ ro@@ s have held their G@@ row@@ th and Development Sum@@ mits , 
as well as matters per@@ taining to skills development and the effici@@ ency of the state system . 
St@@ ar@@ ting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to tra@@ ine@@ es in need , who enter these institutions . 
which produce tra@@ d@@ ables for both the dom@@ estic and export market@@ s , 
in line with the National Indu@@ stri@@ al Polic@@ y Fr@@ ame@@ work which has now been completed , we will :

As the Hon@@ our@@ able Members know , we have also signific@@ an@@ tly increased the number of non-@@ fee pa@@ ying schools . 
In addition , Tel@@ ko@@ m will apply a special low rate for international b@@ and@@ wid@@ th to 10 development call centres 
With regard to communic@@ ations , I am ple@@ ased to ann@@ oun@@ ce that the Department of Comm@@ unic@@ ations together with the mo@@ bile tele@@ phone companies 
At the same time , we shall urg@@ ently resol@@ ve the issue of responsib@@ ilities between the national and provincial s@@ pher@@ es in the management of the F@@ ET system .

Qu@@ ite clear@@ ly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjo@@ y the happ@@ iness that comes with a growing economy , 
having sur@@ passed the 10 00@@ 0 targ@@ et we set our@@ selves , we will increase the number of young people eng@@ aged in the National Y@@ ou@@ th Service by at least 2@@ 0 00@@ 0 through 1@@ 8 of our departments 
process the Com@@ pan@@ ies Bill , adopted for public com@@ ment by Cabinet last W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , 
The progress we have made with regard to the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of F@@ ur@@ ther Education and Tra@@ ining Col@@ leg@@ es has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibility for us signific@@ an@@ tly to exp@@ and the number of available ar@@ tis@@ ans . 
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help sen@@ d the mess@@ age especially to our young people , that ar@@ tis@@ an skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of quali@@ fication . 
The special rate will be directly compar@@ able to those for the same service and capacity per month offer@@ ed in any of the compar@@ able countries .

In this regard , we wish to commen@@ d the role played by the Jo@@ int In@@ iti@@ ative on S@@ k@@ ills Ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion , which br@@ ings together government , business , labour , training in@@ stit@@ utes and others . 
with employment opportunities â and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , bi@@ g and small , which have respon@@ ded in a s@@ pl@@ en@@ did and practic@@ al manner to this initi@@ ative ; 
and have the potential to ab@@ sor@@ b large po@@ ol@@ s of se@@ mi@@ -@@ sk@@ illed workers ; 
In this regard , in order further to spe@@ ed up the implementation of As@@ gi@@ SA , over and above the multi-@@ year programmes announc@@ ed in the recent past , government will this year : 
complete the process of re@@ view@@ ing the countr@@ ys experience in the ar@@ ticul@@ ation among such mac@@ ro-@@ economic indic@@ ators as the Ex@@ change R@@ ate , 
After int@@ ense inter@@ action between government and leaders of our uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , agreement has been re@@ ached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . 
This must include a determined dri@@ ve to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
B@@ ec@@ ause of this , during the course of this year , we will among other th@@ ings : 
that will purcha@@ se 10 of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds from local produc@@ ers and sel@@ l them to local cut@@ ters and produc@@ ers . 
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concer@@ ted dri@@ ve in which all of South Africa should eng@@ age in order to reduce the levels of poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality in our society . 
developing high-@@ spe@@ ed national and international broad@@ band capacity , fin@@ alising the plan to improve the capacity of the ra@@ il and port oper@@ ators , and strength@@ ening the effec@@ tiveness of our competi@@ tion authorities . 
In car@@ r@@ ying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA World C@@ up is the best ever . 
With regard to min@@ eral benef@@ ici@@ ation for inst@@ ance , we will set up a State Di@@ am@@ ond Tra@@ der 
We wish in this regard to congrat@@ ul@@ ate our Local Organ@@ ising Committee and other partners for the ster@@ ling work they are doing .

spe@@ eding up the implementation of the taxi rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation project , implemen@@ ting deta@@ iled plans for passeng@@ er ra@@ il and road transport including the 
This year we shall complete con@@ cre@@ te plans on implementation of the final st@@ ages of our programmes to meet the targ@@ ets for uni@@ vers@@ al access to water in 200@@ 8 , san@@ itation in 2@@ 0@@ 10 and electricity in 2@@ 0@@ 12 . 
Ra@@ ther , what is required is effective organisation , mobil@@ isation and lead@@ ership of the mas@@ s of law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement , intelligence and correc@@ tions officers , and function@@ aries of the justice system . 
spe@@ eding up of the construction of low@@ -@@ cost housing which will require the urg@@ ent establishment of a Spec@@ ial P@@ ur@@ pose V@@ e@@ hic@@ le to hand@@ le fin@@ ances , 
This is that the contribut@@ ory ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related p@@ il@@ la@@ r of our social security system is mis@@ sing or un@@ reli@@ able for large numbers of working people . 
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strength@@ ening our fight against crime are effec@@ tively implemented . 
A critical part of this re@@ form will be the task of repa@@ iring a de@@ fect identified in the 200@@ 2 Re@@ port of the Committee of In@@ qu@@ iry into a Com@@ prehensive Sy@@ st@@ em of Social Security in South Africa . 
expan@@ ding access to E@@ arly Child@@ ho@@ od Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me ; 
In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years , 
We shall also fin@@ alise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on , including the comprehensive 
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
p@@ il@@ o@@ ting of the Land U@@ se Management Bill and ensuring that the re@@ ma@@ ining el@@ ements of the mu@@ ch@@ -@@ del@@ a@@ yed agreement with the private sector on low@@ -@@ cost housing are fin@@ alised ; 
will not be bul@@ li@@ ed into ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing the taxi rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation project , 
continu@@ ing work to address especially the various non-@@ natural cau@@ ses of death in our society as well as li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le disea@@ ses , mal@@ ari@@ a , the various stra@@ ins of TB , road ac@@ cid@@ ents and viol@@ ent crime . 
continu@@ ation of the minim@@ um benefits contain@@ ed in our social gr@@ ants system with the benefits paid through a moder@@ n administrative system ; 
we need to expl@@ ore the introduc@@ tion of an ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-@@ related contribut@@ ory social security system that is informed by the princip@@ le of social solid@@ ar@@ ity . 
The princip@@ le gu@@ i@@ ding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government bud@@ get , 
expan@@ ding training and employment of nur@@ ses and social workers as well as au@@ x@@ ili@@ aries , increasing the number of training institutions , improv@@ ing the quality of training , and institu@@ ting a bur@@ s@@ ary system ; 
continu@@ ing with the implementation of the re@@ mun@@ eration disp@@ ens@@ ation for medical profession@@ als , and providing additional resources further to improve the re@@ mun@@ eration levels of teach@@ ers ; 
In addition , we have also started exam@@ ining measures to re@@ ach vulner@@ able children over the age of 14 years . 
and in this regard , let me take this opportunity to empha@@ si@@ se that government and our partners in SAN@@ T@@ AC@@ O 
For us it is not a m@@ ere c@@ lic@@ h@@ Ã@@ © to as@@ ser@@ t that the success of our democracy should 
ensuring the implementation , without further del@@ ay , of measures to reduce the cost of medic@@ ines ; 
In this regard , government comm@@ its itself to inten@@ si@@ fy the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all el@@ ements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , hom@@ e-@@ based care and treatment . 
The Minister of Fin@@ ance will further el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on these issues in the B@@ ud@@ get S@@ pe@@ ec@@ h . 
B@@ us R@@ ap@@ id Tran@@ sit Sy@@ st@@ em in the Met@@ ro@@ s and rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation of Met@@ ror@@ a@@ il : 
What we should under@@ line though is that in fin@@ ishing the new social security disp@@ ens@@ ation , 
government will under@@ take a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individu@@ ally and through NE@@ D@@ L@@ A@@ C . 
The challenge that we face in addres@@ sing this issue has little to do with policies . 
This will mean that all South Africans will enjo@@ y memb@@ ership of a common , administr@@ atively efficient social in@@ sur@@ ance system , 
We shall ensure that the partnerships buil@@ t over the years are strength@@ ened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions is fin@@ alised as soon as possible . 
we aim this year to complete the work already started to re@@ form our system of social security so that pha@@ sed implementation can start as early as possible . 
All these efforts , Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person , must go hand in hand with a susta@@ ined dri@@ ve to improve community safety and security . 
and any attemp@@ ts to under@@ min@@ e public order in pursu@@ it of self@@ ish interests will be deal@@ t with accor@@ ding@@ ly ; 
while those ear@@ ning higher in@@ comes will be able to continue contri@@ bu@@ ting to private reti@@ rement and in@@ sur@@ ance sch@@ em@@ es . 
In the discussions thu@@ s far conducted within government , con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is emerg@@ ing that el@@ ements of this system would need to include : 
and will be measu@@ red by the con@@ cre@@ te step@@ s we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulner@@ able in our society . 
a w@@ age sub@@ sid@@ y for low@@ -@@ w@@ age employees , possib@@ ly direc@@ ted at first ent@@ ran@@ ts into the job market , especially young people ; 
improve our anal@@ ysis of crime tr@@ ends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime com@@ ba@@ ting . 
But the mess@@ age that our collec@@ tive experience communic@@ ates to all of us is that , working together , 
We h@@ ere@@ by wish to ple@@ dge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most est@@ e@@ emed of multi@@ lat@@ eral bodi@@ es , 
In this regard , two major surve@@ ys will be under@@ taken in 200@@ 7 . 
cho@@ sen to participate in a Community S@@ ur@@ ve@@ y , which will give government as ac@@ cur@@ ate as possible a s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . 
complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effec@@ tiveness of our an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption strateg@@ ies for all s@@ pher@@ es of government ; 
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , 
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Chair@@ person : 
J@@ ust over a month ago , South Africa started its t@@ our of duty as a non-@@ permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . 
utili@@ se to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and gener@@ ally improve management of the courts and the pro@@ sec@@ ution service , in order mas@@ sively to reduce case back@@ log@@ s ; 
bring to full capacity the for@@ en@@ sic labor@@ ator@@ ies which have been equip@@ ped with the latest technology , and ensure the op@@ tim@@ um uti@@ l@@ isation of the f@@ inger@@ prin@@ t data@@ base 
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : 
and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challeng@@ ing as it was uni@@ que for our young democracy . 
we cannot under@@ play the challenges that we face in dealing with the re@@ ma@@ ining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sud@@ an , including the situation in Dar@@ fu@@ r , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire and Som@@ ali@@ a . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , while we are fully jus@@ tified in celeb@@ r@@ ating the achiev@@ ements that Africa has made in her en@@ de@@ av@@ our to achieve peace and development , 
conduct capacity assess@@ ments and imple@@ ment interven@@ tions in Provincial Depart@@ ments responsible for local government , as well as the Offic@@ es of the Premi@@ ers , while continu@@ ing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to co@@ operate fully in these important under@@ tak@@ ings . 
continue to improve the re@@ mun@@ eration and working conditions of the police , and start the process of further expan@@ ding the personnel of the South African Police Service 
We will continue to work with the si@@ ster people of the D@@ RC , as well as Bur@@ un@@ di , the Com@@ oro@@ s and Sud@@ an in particular 
imple@@ ment the programmes dec@@ ided upon to build more correc@@ tions facilities and re@@ alise the objectives of the Wh@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on Cor@@ rec@@ tions ; 
and implemen@@ ting other recommend@@ ations of the T@@ ask Te@@ am that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this v@@ ital institution ; 
ac@@ tual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the crimin@@ als . 
We will also take the necessary step@@ s to imple@@ ment the required programme of action that will em@@ er@@ ge as a result of the pe@@ er review process . 
We should today , even more confi@@ den@@ tly , spe@@ ak together of freedom . 
further capac@@ it@@ ate and provide more support to the institution of traditional lead@@ ership . 
These 30 00@@ 0 individu@@ als will be trac@@ ked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such 
against the person oc@@ cu@@ r in the most socio-@@ econom@@ ically de@@ pri@@ ved areas of our country and require strong and susta@@ ined community interven@@ tions foc@@ used on crime prevention . 
F@@ ur@@ ther to improve its service to the people , government should op@@ ti@@ mi@@ se its capacity and organis@@ ational effici@@ ency . 
We should d@@ are to act in concer@@ t to pursu@@ e the happ@@ iness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
especially in respect of bor@@ der control , and improve the work of the inter@@ depart@@ mental coordin@@ ating structures in this regard ; 
inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach and awareness on issues of national spati@@ al development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the har@@ mon@@ isation of planning instru@@ ments across the three s@@ pher@@ es ; 
to ensure that the condi@@ tion of peace and st@@ ability thu@@ s far at@@ tained trans@@ lat@@ es without p@@ ause into concer@@ ted action for economic re@@ construction and social development . 
â inde@@ ed , many of the recent succes@@ ses in sol@@ ving serious crime incidents have been facilit@@ ated by these systems ; 
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to dis@@ charge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
we can and shall suc@@ ce@@ ed in meeting the common objective we have set our@@ selves as a n@@ ation - 
to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and re@@ present much that is u@@ g@@ ly and re@@ pul@@ sive in human society . 
Sim@@ il@@ arly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to spe@@ ed up the implementation of the NEPA@@ D programmes . 
As of two days ago 6 00@@ 0 field workers from St@@ atisti@@ cs South Africa have gone out across our country to collec@@ t information on 2@@ 8@@ 0 00@@ 0 house@@ holds 
We should not and do not under@@ play the many difficul@@ ties we still con@@ front . 
Im@@ prov@@ ing govern@@ ance also means having a sound statistical data@@ base about social dy@@ nam@@ ics within our n@@ ation . 
Community Cent@@ res be@@ y@@ ond the 9@@ 0 currently oper@@ ational ; 
start the process of further moder@@ n@@ ising the systems of the South African Revenue Services , 
as mig@@ ration , labour market tran@@ si@@ tions , inter-@@ gener@@ ational mob@@ ility and household formation and dis@@ sol@@ ution . 
As we have already said , these and other measures will suc@@ ce@@ ed only if we build an end@@ uring partnership in 
in ac@@ tual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ e even the little quality time they could have with their famil@@ ies , in defence of our freedom and our security . 
We are con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that solu@@ tions to the log@@ j@@ am@@ s currently being experi@@ enced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries ali@@ ke that these tal@@ ks should re@@ ach fru@@ ition .

In this regard , we are hear@@ ten@@ ed by the resol@@ ve sh@@ own by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . 
do every@@ thing necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . 
Our government will respon@@ d appropri@@ ately and as our capacity per@@ mits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Som@@ ali@@ a . 
One of the critical questions that we shall pursu@@ e in this regard is the spe@@ ed@@ y re@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of the Do@@ ha Development R@@ ound of W@@ T@@ O negoti@@ ations . 
I should men@@ tion in this regard that the Min@@ istr@@ y of S@@ af@@ ety and Security and the Police Service are working on propos@@ als further to improve the function@@ ing and effec@@ tiveness of the v@@ it@@ ally important Community Police For@@ ums . 
fin@@ alise re@@ ma@@ ining el@@ ements of measures to trans@@ form the judi@@ ci@@ ary and improve its function@@ ing , in consultation with this em@@ in@@ ent institution of our democracy ; 
We are not there yet . 
A@@ mong the gre@@ at@@ est achiev@@ ements of the peop@@ les of Africa in the past tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ half years has been the rest@@ or@@ ation of peace in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es Regi@@ on . 
National Def@@ ence For@@ ce to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dre@@ am fin@@ ds practic@@ al re@@ alisation in the hom@@ el@@ and of P@@ at@@ ric@@ e L@@ um@@ um@@ ba . 
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of these public serv@@ ants have prov@@ en over and over again 
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by f@@ illing vac@@ ant posts , improv@@ ing systems 
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislat@@ ors , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations 
complete , within the next 1@@ 8 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant nor@@ ms and standards , re@@ mun@@ eration policy and matters per@@ taining to medical a@@ id and pen@@ sions ; 
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the s@@ pher@@ es , including training of manag@@ ers responsible for the implementation of this system ; 
continue with the processes further to capac@@ it@@ ate our intelligence ag@@ encies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ; 
rol@@ l out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , inten@@ si@@ fy ou@@ tre@@ ach activities including iz@@ im@@ bi@@ z@@ o and set up more multi@@ purpose 
inter@@ act with one another to find a sol@@ ution that is inclu@@ sive and practic@@ able , based on the need to achieve national recon@@ cili@@ ation . 
In addition to the many on@@ going programmes that we have been implemen@@ ting , government will this year : 
imple@@ ment the recommend@@ ations of the Kha@@ m@@ pe@@ pe Commission on the man@@ date and operations of the Director@@ ate of Spec@@ ial Oper@@ ations ; 
S@@ ince the popul@@ ar man@@ date of 200@@ 4 , we have made welcome progress in further chang@@ ing South Africa for the better . 
In this regard we will also continue to eng@@ age the leaders of the peop@@ les of Palestin@@ e , Isra@@ el , Ira@@ q , Iran and other countries in the Mid@@ d@@ le East and the Per@@ si@@ an G@@ ul@@ f . 
a social security tax to fin@@ ance basic reti@@ rement sa@@ v@@ ings , death , dis@@ ability and un@@ employment benefits . 
In O@@ c@@ to@@ ber another 30 00@@ 0 individu@@ als in 8 00@@ 0 house@@ holds will be selected to participate in South Afric@@ as first national p@@ anel stud@@ y , the National In@@ come D@@ y@@ nam@@ ics St@@ ud@@ y . 
And so , let us rol@@ l up our s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we year@@ n is a common responsibility we all share . 
We are pr@@ ou@@ d , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in hel@@ ping to bring this about â from the young men and women in our 
But no one , except our@@ selves , shall ensure that this dre@@ am is re@@ alised . 
ï»¿@@ It was the best of times , it was the wor@@ st of times , it was the age of w@@ is@@ do@@ m , it was the age of f@@ ool@@ ish@@ ness , it was the e@@ po@@ ch of belie@@ f , 
O@@ f course , I have ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no doub@@ t that we will hon@@ our our under@@ taking to FIFA and the world community of s@@ occ@@ er players

Chair@@ person of SA@@ L@@ G@@ A , ma@@ y@@ ors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
Accor@@ ding@@ ly , we will this year complete the lic@@ ens@@ ing and oper@@ ation@@ alisation of In@@ f@@ rac@@ o . 
We are also pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed to have among us Ms J@@ an@@ n T@@ ur@@ ner , the da@@ ugh@@ ter of Ric@@ k T@@ ur@@ ner who was mur@@ der@@ ed by apartheid ag@@ ents 30 years ago . 
we were all going direct to He@@ av@@ en , we were all going direct the other way - 
The details of other volun@@ t@@ ary and man@@ d@@ atory actions in the P@@ ow@@ er Con@@ servation Program@@ me have been set out by the Ministers and these will be re@@ fin@@ ed through consultation with the various stakehol@@ ders and then published . 
I would also like to take this opportunity to sal@@ ute President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , one of the pre-@@ em@@ in@@ ent foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers of our democracy , who will mar@@ k his 9@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day on 1@@ 8 J@@ uly this year . 
Government will start implemen@@ ting a campaign to ensure efficient ligh@@ ting , sol@@ ar water he@@ ating and ge@@ y@@ ser load management in house@@ holds , including housing standards for all new hou@@ ses and develop@@ ments . 
and the projects that the jo@@ int team of government , labour , business and academ@@ ic institutions organised under the Jo@@ int In@@ iti@@ ative on Pri@@ ority S@@ k@@ ills Ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion will be inten@@ si@@ fied . 
In eight days time , on F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 1@@ 6 , she will be 9@@ 2 years old . 
This is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same approach we must adop@@ t as we continue to pre@@ p@@ are to host the FIFA Con@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ations C@@ up in 200@@ 9 
I particularly want to pay tri@@ bute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resol@@ ve a re@@ al cri@@ sis that h@@ it us on the 2@@ 4@@ th of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary . 
Al@@ low me on this occa@@ sion of the pen@@ ul@@ tim@@ ate Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of the thir@@ d Parliament 
I am ple@@ ased to say that we have inde@@ ed done much to imple@@ ment the commit@@ ments we made to the people in 200@@ 4 . 
Wor@@ king together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urg@@ ently as possible , 
I would also like to thank all citizens for their res@@ ili@@ ence and for@@ be@@ aring in the face of the current difficul@@ ties . 
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordin@@ ate this activity suppor@@ ted by the line Depart@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses . 
As we act together every@@ where in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is â Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al ! 
who will assist government with the energy effici@@ ency campaign and inform invest@@ ors and communities on the ac@@ tual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges . 
I will con@@ v@@ ene a meeting of the Jo@@ int Presid@@ ential Wor@@ king Grou@@ ps to coordin@@ ate our overall actions . 
, to do all the th@@ ings that have to be done , understanding that in a very re@@ al sen@@ se , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hand@@ s ! 
All these actions , taken together with the electricity sa@@ ving measures , will improve cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y and ra@@ ise the re@@ serve marg@@ in . 
Let me now turn to the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities I mentioned . 
In@@ de@@ ed , they re@@ present a celeb@@ ration of the in@@ dom@@ itable sp@@ iri@@ t of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not bet@@ ra@@ y or dis@@ appoint the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of the people . 
You will ask whether I ag@@ ree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of con@@ fu@@ sion 
it was the e@@ po@@ ch of incre@@ dul@@ ity , it was the seas@@ on of L@@ ight , it was the seas@@ on of Dar@@ k@@ ness , 
And South Africa is not al@@ one : there are pres@@ su@@ res on supply regarding our expan@@ sion projects in Ch@@ ile and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il . 
The re@@ al challenge is to respon@@ d to them in a manner that con@@ ve@@ ys the defin@@ ite mess@@ age to every@@ body in our country and the milli@@ ons in Africa 
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in wh@@ at@@ ever way they can . In a meeting with the Chair@@ man of General Elec@@ tri@@ c during the course of last week , G@@ E offer@@ ed to assist by pro@@ cur@@ ing sc@@ ar@@ ce tur@@ b@@ ine equipment on our behalf . 
As I was prepar@@ ing this Ad@@ dres@@ s , one among us sugg@@ ested to me that our country was being bu@@ f@@ fet@@ ed by strong cros@@ sw@@ in@@ ds 
They are concerned about the national emerg@@ ency into which the country has been th@@ row@@ n by the un@@ expected dis@@ rup@@ tions in the supply of electricity . 
The mas@@ sive Es@@ ko@@ m build programme in new gener@@ ation , trans@@ mission and distribution capacity will continue ; 
spe@@ eding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social go@@ als 
I spe@@ ak here today in the presence of my mother , E@@ pain@@ et@@ te Mbe@@ ki , Ma@@ M@@ of@@ okeng , 
An instruc@@ tion has been issued for all government buil@@ dings to reduce their consu@@ mp@@ tion of electricity and please fe@@ el free to name and sha@@ me those who do not . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , like all the Hon@@ our@@ able Members , 
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether our country is threat@@ ened by the an@@ arch@@ y represented by the criminal tor@@ ching of six passeng@@ er tra@@ ins in Tsh@@ wane last month . 
And such is the in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion that history has im@@ posed on us today . 
I am aware of the fact that many in our society are tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led by a de@@ ep sen@@ se of un@@ e@@ ase about where our country will be tom@@ or@@ row . 
H@@ ap@@ p@@ ily , this State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s has given me the pos@@ sibility to report to Parliament and the N@@ ation on our 2@@ 4 A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities which 
Let us ensure that all hand@@ s are on dec@@ k to address the tur@@ bul@@ ence that has h@@ it us , in@@ sp@@ ired by the approach that our circumstances call for Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al ! 
These are being dis@@ semin@@ ated by the Department of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and we remain open to any other sugg@@ es@@ tions that you , our comp@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ ts , may give to us and share with one another . 
improv@@ ing the effec@@ tiveness of our interven@@ tions direc@@ ted at the Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y , and poverty er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation 
In South Africa our own large companies such as S@@ as@@ ol , Ang@@ lo and B@@ H@@ P B@@ ill@@ it@@ on are all in con@@ cre@@ te discussions with the Depart@@ ments of Min@@ eral and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y 
This must say to all of us that we are inde@@ ed in a period of challenges , but sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table challenges . 
the further ac@@ cel@@ eration of our economic growth and development 
They are wor@@ ri@@ ed about whether we have the capacity to def@@ end the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . 
will present later this month makes the necessary alloc@@ ations to give us the means to imple@@ ment the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities . 
Chair@@ person of the National house of traditional leaders and our hon@@ oured traditional leaders ; 
Mr Jac@@ o@@ b Z@@ uma , For@@ mer Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Cong@@ res@@ s ; 
All these hon@@ oured gu@@ ests , re@@ presenting both m@@ em@@ ory and hope , remin@@ d us by their presence that ours is a task in a rel@@ ay rac@@ e 
rev@@ amp@@ ing the criminal justice system to inten@@ si@@ fy our off@@ ensive against crime 
Wor@@ king with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the under@@ sea c@@ ables . 
As the Hon@@ our@@ able Members know , she said : I don@@ t regard the problems of energy supply here as a disa@@ ster . 
We face an emerg@@ ency but we can over@@ come the problems in a rel@@ atively short period . 
Most ob@@ vi@@ ously it would be ir@@ responsible to ign@@ ore these and other concer@@ ns or dis@@ mis@@ s them as m@@ ere j@@ er@@ em@@ i@@ ad@@ s typ@@ ical of the pr@@ oph@@ ets of d@@ oo@@ m . 
to the enti@@ re@@ ty of our n@@ ation to give con@@ cre@@ te expres@@ sion to the call we have just made for all of us to un@@ ite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . 
that made it especially difficult to fore@@ see where our country will be tom@@ or@@ row . 
I men@@ tion this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some el@@ se@@ where in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents success@@ fully . 
The sen@@ se that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further a@@ field , represented by the ac@@ tual da@@ ily progress 
it was the sp@@ ring of hope , it was the win@@ ter of des@@ pa@@ ir , we had every@@ thing before us , we had no@@ thing before us , 
What she exp@@ ec@@ ts as her bir@@ th@@ day present is the tr@@ ut@@ h . 
Al@@ ready , money has been allocated for S@@ ent@@ ec@@ h to become a w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess inter@@ net wh@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er as well as fin@@ ance its dig@@ iti@@ s@@ ation . 
for the ann@@ ual deb@@ ate on the state of our n@@ ation , to wish all the Hon@@ our@@ able Members of Parliament a happ@@ y and produc@@ tive New Y@@ e@@ ar . 
further strength@@ ening the machin@@ ery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respon@@ d to our development im@@ per@@ atives and , 
State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s of the President of South Africa , Tha@@ bo Mbe@@ ki : Jo@@ int S@@ it@@ ting of Parliament F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 200@@ 8 
and where possible , some projects will be ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated . 
We must ensure that we susta@@ in this approach . 
We are fully aware that a critical el@@ ement of our prepar@@ ations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the foot@@ b@@ all fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ity pr@@ ou@@ d . 
Once more we thank the S@@ pr@@ ing@@ bok@@ s for show@@ ing the way when they w@@ on the Ru@@ g@@ by World C@@ up last year . 
of continu@@ ous re@@ birth so that the dre@@ am of a better life becomes a re@@ ality for all South Africans . 
Li@@ ke the rest of our Government I am con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that the fundament@@ als that have informed our countr@@ ys forward mar@@ ch in the last 14 years remain in place . 
My answ@@ er to this question is a defin@@ ite No ! 
At the same time , we aim to provide dig@@ ital broad@@ casting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . 
We welcome to this occa@@ sion Mr Ar@@ thu@@ r M@@ arg@@ e@@ man , re@@ presenting the v@@ eter@@ ans of the A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra bus bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t of fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , who include N@@ el@@ son Mandela . 
The main categories of these prior@@ ities are : 
We are about to beg@@ in the last full financial year of the current and thir@@ d democratic par@@ liam@@ ent and government soon after which we will hold our f@@ our@@ th general elec@@ tions . 
The national emerg@@ ency represented by the current power out@@ ages po@@ ses the challenge and pres@@ ents the opportunity 
Government will continue our industri@@ alisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employ@@ ment@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
We ac@@ knowledge , both among the Hon@@ our@@ able Members and our gu@@ ests , the many found@@ ers of the United De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Fr@@ on@@ t , 2@@ 5 years ago . 
H@@ av@@ ing no@@ ted that the t@@ ar@@ din@@ ess with which government processes applications for investment in rel@@ ation to issues such as land acqu@@ isi@@ tion , infrastructure 
and el@@ se@@ where in the world who wat@@ ch our country with ke@@ en interest , that we remain fir@@ m in our resol@@ ve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people , but also to many others outside our bor@@ ders . 
The Government has therefore re@@ view@@ ed the di@@ stance we have travel@@ led in terms of implemen@@ ting the man@@ date given by the people in 200@@ 4 . 
I thank her for taking the tr@@ ou@@ ble to be with us today , and tr@@ ust that we will not dis@@ appoint her . 
T@@ ask team@@ s are currently working in many areas . 
I say this because , in our own esti@@ mation , it is not often that a n@@ ation is called upon to stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of its collec@@ tive body to at@@ tain a dre@@ am . 
This must in@@ sp@@ ire B@@ af@@ ana B@@ af@@ ana , as it must in@@ sp@@ ire our ath@@ let@@ es who will comp@@ ete in the Beij@@ ing Olymp@@ ic G@@ ames later this year . 
work is progres@@ sing urg@@ ently to set up a call centre through which prospec@@ tive invest@@ ors and government can trac@@ k these processes . 
S@@ ure , the problems here are serious ; over@@ coming them will require ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity , especially in energy effici@@ ency and energy sa@@ ving , as well as the development of altern@@ ative power sup@@ pl@@ ies . 
I will also shor@@ tly ann@@ oun@@ ce a team of E@@ ner@@ g@@ y Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons consi@@ sting of prom@@ in@@ ent and knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able South Africans 
F@@ ur@@ ther to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate our economic growth and development we will imple@@ ment the Indu@@ stri@@ al Polic@@ y Ac@@ tion Pl@@ an . 
I am confi@@ dent that 200@@ 8 will be one of the most re@@ mar@@ k@@ able years of our democracy , as we all work together to re@@ alise the c@@ ore asp@@ ir@@ ation of our people to at@@ tain a better life for all . 
on which it must focus in a special way , using these as cat@@ al@@ y@@ sts further to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate progress towards the achiev@@ ement of the objectives the people man@@ d@@ ated us to pursu@@ e . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver it is im@@ per@@ ative that all enterpri@@ ses become more energy efficient . 
Let me therefore make bol@@ d to say that this histor@@ ical mom@@ ent dem@@ ands that our n@@ ation should un@@ ite as never before and stra@@ in every s@@ ine@@ w of its collec@@ tive body 
This having been said , it is ho@@ we@@ ver also necessary that we take this opportunity to con@@ ve@@ y to the country the ap@@ ologi@@ es of both the 
, in which all of us cannot but lo@@ se our way , un@@ sure of our step@@ s , un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y on our fe@@ et , fe@@ ar@@ ful of the future ! 
and lo@@ vers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent . 
Once more I would like to empha@@ si@@ se that we remain determined to support the aut@@ omo@@ tive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Mo@@ tor Indu@@ stry Development Program@@ me is main@@ tained . 
On the supply side Es@@ ko@@ m is working fu@@ ri@@ ously to ensure the introduc@@ tion of co-@@ gener@@ ation projects as a matter of urg@@ ency . 
M@@ ore than at any other time , the situation that con@@ fron@@ ts our n@@ ation and country , 
They will be suppor@@ ted by technical team@@ s from E@@ D@@ I Hol@@ dings , Es@@ ko@@ m and the National E@@ ner@@ g@@ y E@@ ffici@@ ency Ag@@ ency . 
In this situation , we have to cur@@ ta@@ il the un@@ planned out@@ ages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce dem@@ and and thu@@ s ensure a better re@@ serve marg@@ in . 
A@@ mong other th@@ ings , we must use the current ad@@ versity to ensure that our hom@@ es and economy become more energy efficient . 
and the att@@ end@@ ant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
fe@@ ars about a thre@@ at to the in@@ depend@@ ence of the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the ru@@ le of law , 
N@@ ex@@ t week the Provincial Premi@@ ers will con@@ v@@ ene their for@@ a with ma@@ y@@ ors to plan and imple@@ ment the energy sa@@ ving measures in all the municipalities across the country . 
We will all work to minim@@ ise the adver@@ se impact these events had on the industry . 
At the mac@@ ro-@@ economic level , we will continue to maintain a f@@ is@@ cal post@@ ure that suppor@@ ts continued economic growth and development and reducing our ex@@ tern@@ al vulner@@ ability . 
, including fre@@ ight and other log@@ is@@ tics , energy pip@@ el@@ ines , information and communic@@ ations technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their tim@@ ing and geograph@@ ic loc@@ ation . 
whether we remain committed to the under@@ taking we have made that tom@@ or@@ row will be better than today . 
Th@@ us should we all re@@ affir@@ m that we remain on course as we continue to stri@@ ve to make ours a win@@ ning n@@ ation . 
at both executive and administrative levels , are h@@ ere@@ by making the fir@@ m under@@ taking that we will use the short period a@@ head of us 
I hope rel@@ atively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed This is not a time for f@@ ing@@ er poin@@ ting , but for working together in fin@@ ding solu@@ tions . 
The approach is one of common action rather than rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation . 
Let us therefore use this emerg@@ ency to put in place the first building bloc@@ ks of the essential energy efficient future we d@@ are not avo@@ id . 
The enti@@ re@@ ty of our system of govern@@ ance is therefore making the commitment that in the period a@@ head of us , it will do its best to live up to the im@@ per@@ ative â Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al ! 
An el@@ ement of governments A@@ pe@@ x of Pri@@ or@@ ities will be del@@ iber@@ ate focus on matters of skills development . 
The resul@@ t@@ ant ti@@ ght supply situation makes the overall system vulner@@ able to any incid@@ ent affec@@ ting the avail@@ ability of energy . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , and not un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted@@ ly , it is ob@@ vi@@ ous that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . 
Our est@@ e@@ emed Chief Justice and members of the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary ; 
C@@ ut@@ ting across these plans , and therefore a critical pri@@ ority , is information and communic@@ ations technology both as a facilit@@ ator and a sector in its own right . 
At@@ t@@ ached to this will be a manufac@@ turing strategy for the development in South Africa of Se@@ t T@@ op Bo@@ x@@ es , which should be fin@@ alised by the mid@@ d@@ le of the year . 
While they recogn@@ ise and respect the right of the r@@ ul@@ ing party to regul@@ ate its own af@@ fairs , they are concerned 
We are a miner@@ als resource economy . We must therefore continue to support the mining industry . 
who also passed away 30 years back after end@@ uring many years of im@@ prison@@ ment , ban@@ ishment and other forms of re@@ pres@@ sion . 
I should rec@@ all the well-@@ known words with which Char@@ les D@@ ick@@ ens opened his no@@ vel , A T@@ ale of Two C@@ ities . 
further to ener@@ gi@@ se our adv@@ ance towards the re@@ alisation of the all@@ -@@ important go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
who came to communic@@ ate an un@@ equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ al mess@@ age from the rural mas@@ ses of the Trans@@ ke@@ i , among whom she has li@@ ved for many dec@@ ad@@ es . 
key action plans in sectors where such plans do not ex@@ ist , such as mining and miner@@ als benef@@ ici@@ ation , consu@@ mer d@@ ur@@ ables , reta@@ il with a focus on improv@@ ing support to small enterpri@@ ses , construction , the cre@@ ative industri@@ es , agricul@@ ture and ag@@ ro-@@ processing . 
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Min@@ er@@ als and E@@ ner@@ g@@ y and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses have ou@@ tl@@ ined the nature of the emerg@@ ency we con@@ front and what each one of us can do to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation . 
We have emerg@@ ency task team@@ s dealing with the challenge of co@@ al quality and supply with the co@@ al mining industry and we are working to f@@ ast trac@@ k the approval and construction of gas tur@@ b@@ ine projects . 
I am certain that the South African Fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all Associ@@ ation , our co@@ ach@@ es led by Car@@ lo@@ s Al@@ ber@@ to Par@@ re@@ ir@@ a , 
In@@ de@@ ed , energy effici@@ ency itself provides economic opportunity . 
Some among these wor@@ ry about the possible impact on our own economy of the thre@@ at of economic rec@@ es@@ sion in the United States . 
, the H@@ on Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week . 
This is driven by such develop@@ ments as the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the National Commissioner of Police , the susp@@ en@@ sion of the National Director of Public Pro@@ secu@@ tions , 
And so I qu@@ ote these words : 
But if all of us can for@@ ge strong partnerships to t@@ ack@@ le the situation , we will all come through â 
This situation has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the in@@ ev@@ itable re@@ alisation that the era of very che@@ a@@ p and ab@@ und@@ ant electricity has come to an end . 
As government our task is to now lead and un@@ ite the country behind a campaign for energy effici@@ ency that will address this challenge . 
In essen@@ ce the significant ri@@ se in electricity dem@@ and over the last two years has out@@ stri@@ p@@ ped the new capacity we have brought on stre@@ am . 
we are making in terms of our all@@ -@@ r@@ ound prepar@@ ations , is one of - Bus@@ iness Un@@ usu@@ al : all hand@@ s on dec@@ k for 2@@ 0@@ 10 ! 
There are con@@ cre@@ te actions each individual , household and business can take . 
They are concerned about some develop@@ ments in our economy , especially the ste@@ ad@@ y increase in interest rates , food and fu@@ el pric@@ es which further im@@ pover@@ ish especially the poor . 
and the 2@@ 0@@ 10 FIFA S@@ occ@@ er World C@@ up which will k@@ ick off in our country 8@@ 5@@ 4 days from today . 
To make certain that this happen@@ s , we have taken the necessary step@@ s to ensure that the Ann@@ ual B@@ ud@@ get the Minister of Fin@@ ance 
We ur@@ ge house@@ holds that can affor@@ d to act immediately to consid@@ er implemen@@ ting these energ@@ y-@@ sa@@ ving measures . 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ; 
enh@@ ancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and Sou@@ th-@@ South relations . 
enh@@ ancing the impact of our programmes targ@@ e@@ ting the cri@@ tically important area of education and training 
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proce@@ ed as we keep our e@@ y@@ es fir@@ m@@ ly foc@@ used on the continued pursu@@ it of the go@@ al of a better life for all our people . 
ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating our adv@@ ance towards the achiev@@ ement of the go@@ al of health for all 
to address our common challenges and keep ali@@ ve the dre@@ am that has susta@@ ined all of us as we travel@@ led along the un@@ char@@ ted road towards the cre@@ ation of the South Africa vis@@ u@@ alised in our Constitution . 
She says these mas@@ ses dem@@ and of all of us who cla@@ im to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them el@@ se@@ where in our country , 
Chief Executive of Ang@@ lo Americ@@ an , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Car@@ rol@@ l , when she addres@@ sed the Min@@ ing In@@ da@@ ba here in Cape Town earli@@ er this week , on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 5 . 
It is in@@ ev@@ itable that if we are to continue on our growth pat@@ h as a manufac@@ turing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . 
and the t@@ as@@ ks we have set our@@ selves , dem@@ and that we in@@ sp@@ ire and organ@@ ise all our people to act together as one 
We are also ple@@ ased that we have among us Mr Din@@ ile@@ si@@ z@@ we So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , son of the outstanding pat@@ ri@@ ot and leader , Ro@@ ber@@ t So@@ bu@@ k@@ we , 
and Public En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses to find cost effective and sustainable solu@@ tions to the supply con@@ stra@@ int . 
efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , so@@ on@@ er rather than later . 
in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its no@@ isi@@ est authorities in@@ sist@@ ed on its being received , for good or for evi@@ l , in the super@@ l@@ ative de@@ g@@ ree of compar@@ is@@ on only . 
This ent@@ ails coordin@@ ating the programmes of the Stat@@ e-@@ owned En@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses and over@@ la@@ ying all the infrastructure plans 
that it must continue to play its role as one of the princip@@ al arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of a democratic , n@@ on@@ racial , n@@ on@@ sex@@ ist and pro@@ sp@@ erous South Africa .

In this regard , R2@@ ,@@ 3 bil@@ li@@ on has been budget@@ ed for industrial policy initiatives and a further R@@ 5 bil@@ li@@ on in tax inc@@ enti@@ ves over three years will support industrial policy .

that we should inde@@ ed , in the words of the Fre@@ edom Char@@ ter , open ever wid@@ er the do@@ ors of learning and of cul@@ ture ! 
We may even say that , in a str@@ ange qu@@ ir@@ k of f@@ ate , many as@@ pec@@ ts of our constitutional order have been te@@ sted in the recent past ; 
All this led to the negoti@@ ations process which cul@@ min@@ ated in our first democratic elec@@ tions in 199@@ 4 . 
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth should also include ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated implementation of affir@@ ma@@ tive action , including B@@ road@@ -based Black E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Em@@ power@@ ment . 
In the end , the challenge is as much about regul@@ ation ; 
While that Con@@ vention defined the ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ial integr@@ ity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial op@@ pres@@ sion and exclu@@ sion .

In@@ forming these our en@@ de@@ av@@ ours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the man@@ date accor@@ ded this government in 200@@ 4 ; 
Y@@ et our central and immedi@@ ate task is fully to appreci@@ ate the consequ@@ ences of these develop@@ ments on our own economy and our region , 
that we have for@@ g@@ ed with B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and India through I@@ B@@ SA ; 
to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular empha@@ sis on implemen@@ ting Summit resol@@ u@@ tions and c@@ em@@ en@@ ting regional strategic co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on .

In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es need improv@@ ement . 
to provide efficient , dec@@ ent and equitable health care ; 
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreci@@ ation that measures to protect the environment and m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
In our own country , we will emb@@ ar@@ k on these under@@ tak@@ ings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development pat@@ h . 
And we believe that , after five con@@ secu@@ tive win@@ s , the national s@@ occ@@ er team is now more confi@@ den@@ tly ge@@ aring itself to perform above exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations ! 
and the United States of Americ@@ a for elec@@ tions the sym@@ bol@@ ism of which trans@@ c@@ ends the n@@ ar@@ row b@@ ound@@ aries of their nation@@ -@@ st@@ ates . 
In addition , we will more wid@@ ely utili@@ se the Social Di@@ st@@ res@@ s Rel@@ ie@@ f G@@ r@@ ant

We were able in the past year to conclud@@ e further negoti@@ ations with the Europ@@ ean Union on our strategic partnership ; 
This is larg@@ ely a result of mas@@ sive expan@@ sion in access to the Chil@@ d Sup@@ port G@@ r@@ ant , 
but be@@ y@@ ond this , that str@@ ong@@ er surve@@ ill@@ ance and action on a global scale have become un@@ avo@@ id@@ able and necessary . 
S@@ har@@ ing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state 
This points to we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in our neighbour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds , especially in building the bon@@ ds of community solid@@ ar@@ ity that would assist us in pre@@ ven@@ ting and com@@ ba@@ ting crime . 
O@@ f course we do know that the dr@@ op@@ out rate particularly at secon@@ d@@ ary and ter@@ ti@@ ary levels is un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high , 
But we cannot satis@@ fy our@@ selves mer@@ ely with quanti@@ t@@ ative change . 
Ste@@ adi@@ ly but sur@@ ely , our continent is progres@@ sing towards her ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , with the interest of her people ri@@ sing to the top of their leaders ag@@ end@@ a ,

But we are not in doub@@ t that that mom@@ ent will yet come so@@ on@@ er rather than later . 
and we do hope that the sp@@ iri@@ t which informed that eng@@ ag@@ ement will prev@@ a@@ il 
But I have dis@@ covered the sec@@ re@@ t that after cli@@ m@@ bing a great h@@ ill , one only fin@@ ds that there are many more h@@ ills to cli@@ m@@ b . 
continu@@ ing research and consult@@ ations on the Com@@ prehensive Social Security Sy@@ st@@ em , including the matter of National Health In@@ sur@@ ance ; 
This also im@@ pl@@ ies a rap@@ id reduc@@ tion in government deb@@ t levels wh@@ en@@ ever conditions turn for the better . 
Al@@ tern@@ atives to la@@ y@@ off@@ s will be expl@@ or@@ ed , including longer hol@@ id@@ a@@ ys , ext@@ ended training , short time and job@@ -@@ shar@@ ing . 
We can do all this ; 
and the educ@@ ational system has yet to produce the requ@@ is@@ ite kin@@ ds of skills needed by society . 
In this regard , we wish to commen@@ d the Com@@ peti@@ tion Commission for the fir@@ m hand that they are show@@ ing to ensure that cul@@ pr@@ its are brought to book . 
E@@ vi@@ dence of the social w@@ age is also seen in mas@@ sive improv@@ ements in access to primary health facilities . 
We are of course Ru@@ g@@ by World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons ; 
and campaign@@ s ensu@@ red that con@@ cre@@ te efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with dis@@ ability and the el@@ der@@ ly . 
B@@ e it in education , health , housing , water or san@@ itation , the central question that con@@ fron@@ ts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services ! 
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l and its success@@ ors for the benefit of future gener@@ ations among our own people and peop@@ les of the world . 
and South Africa stand@@ s ready to assist wh@@ er@@ ever we can . 
In@@ de@@ ed , in a period in which others are experi@@ encing or projec@@ ting rec@@ es@@ sions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still po@@ ised for growth , even if at a s@@ lower rate . 
with sever@@ e consequ@@ ences for ac@@ tual production and trade . 
It is ste@@ adi@@ ly growing str@@ ong@@ er . 
and further a@@ field to better the human condi@@ tion . 
and the following b@@ road categories of respon@@ ses are under discus@@ sion : 
On the other , we will spe@@ ed up the introduc@@ tion of the next pha@@ se of the Ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed Public Wor@@ ks Program@@ me . 
We are also encouraged that , wh@@ at@@ ever f@@ its and star@@ ts may se@@ em to character@@ ise the progress of the people of the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Republic of Con@@ go 
our Par@@ al@@ y@@ mp@@ i@@ ans continue to do us pr@@ ou@@ d ; 
With@@ in public and private institutions , the pos@@ sibility of ne@@ f@@ ari@@ ous sch@@ em@@ es si@@ ph@@ on@@ ing off resources through cor@@ ruption is always a sour@@ ce of great concern 
The pre@@ val@@ ence of hun@@ g@@ er among children has vir@@ tually hal@@ ved over four years . 
There is no ga@@ in@@ saying that , by any meas@@ ure , the progress made since 199@@ 4 has been im@@ pres@@ sive . 
It is this , and this al@@ one , that has informed our per@@ sist@@ ence in assi@@ sting the people of Zimbabwe to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to the cri@@ sis in that country . 
The partnership buil@@ t in the recent period between the lead@@ ership of the D@@ RC and R@@ wan@@ da holds out a prom@@ ise for adv@@ ances in matters of security and in dealing with the human@@ itarian cri@@ sis ; 
It is ap@@ t therefore to remin@@ d our@@ selves of that instruc@@ tive ob@@ servation of hope and res@@ ili@@ ence , continu@@ ity and change , by former President N@@ el@@ son Mandela , in his bi@@ ograph@@ y , L@@ ong W@@ al@@ k to Fre@@ edom : 
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the targ@@ et for 1@@ -@@ milli@@ on work opportunities through the 
so Israel@@ is and Palestin@@ i@@ ans can enjo@@ y peace and security as neigh@@ b@@ ours within their so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign ter@@ rit@@ or@@ ies . 
on their mar@@ ch to st@@ ability and pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity , that progress is in@@ ex@@ or@@ able . 
The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work ; 
and the progress that government has made in ful@@ f@@ illing the man@@ date of the elec@@ tor@@ ate . 
and the im@@ per@@ ative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elec@@ tions fin@@ ds a ready plat@@ form to imple@@ ment its programmes without un@@ due del@@ a@@ ys . 
And yet human@@ ity today fac@@ es the dang@@ er that the at@@ tain@@ ment of these objectives could be post@@ pon@@ ed by many years , 
and Col@@ oured communities has dec@@ lin@@ ed , par@@ tly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social gr@@ ants . 
Now the work of re@@ construction can start in ear@@ n@@ est ; 
This has cre@@ ated the pos@@ sibility mas@@ sively to exp@@ and this programme and improve its quality . 
and , with it , the freedom to ch@@ oo@@ se their pat@@ h of development . 
We believe that the time has come to strengthen dom@@ estic regul@@ ation and super@@ vision of the financial system ; 
The ab@@ i@@ ding les@@ son from this experience is that we need str@@ ong@@ er partnerships among economic role players on a dom@@ estic 
In the coming few months pen@@ ding the national and provincial elec@@ tions , we will en@@ de@@ av@@ our to complete that popul@@ ar man@@ date . 
We have on coun@@ t@@ less occa@@ sions expres@@ sed our concern at the per@@ sist@@ ence of conflict in the Mid@@ d@@ le East in general and in Isra@@ el and Palestin@@ e in particular . 
Vi@@ ol@@ ence against women and children is much too high . 
and san@@ itation . 
and exten@@ ding the number of municipalities that have set up Child@@ ren@@ s Rights F@@ oc@@ al Po@@ in@@ ts be@@ y@@ ond the current 6@@ 0 . 
, f@@ em@@ al@@ e-@@ head@@ ed house@@ holds have received a big@@ g@@ er-@@ than@@ -@@ a@@ ver@@ age share of the social w@@ age including housing and health care ; 
we adopted have hel@@ ped us avo@@ id the wor@@ st impact of the cri@@ sis . 
Hon@@ our@@ able Members will be fam@@ ili@@ ar with most of the data on matters relating to the social w@@ age . 
but also to put in place measures that would ob@@ vi@@ ate a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence . 
to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to hal@@ ve un@@ employment and poverty by 2@@ 0@@ 14 . 
as well as partnership with the private sector and uti@@ l@@ isation of resources control@@ led by workers such as pen@@ sion funds . 
they pre@@ fer to carry forward the no@@ ble work of this great freedom figh@@ ter and other found@@ ers of our democracy . 
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , d@@ are not l@@ ing@@ er , for long wal@@ k is not yet ended . 
In addition , tr@@ ends in performance , both in terms of teach@@ ing and learning , sho@@ w a wor@@ r@@ ying per@@ sist@@ ence of the social divi@@ sions of the past . 
We wish in this regard to congrat@@ ul@@ ate all the parties in Zimbabwe for conclu@@ ding negoti@@ ations , 
and con@@ st@@ ant supply of basic services such as cle@@ an running water and electricity . 
Fir@@ stly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R@@ 6@@ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ bil@@ li@@ on for the next three years . 
and the African Union to pursu@@ e these objectives in Bur@@ un@@ di , Sud@@ an , Western Sa@@ h@@ ara , C@@ Ã@@ ´@@ te d@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , Som@@ ali@@ a and el@@ se@@ where . 
There can be no jus@@ tific@@ ation for such acts of wan@@ ton de@@ struc@@ tion and sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ery . 
and we are informed that all clin@@ ics now have access to pot@@ able water . 
We do hope though that civil society will enh@@ ance its own level of acti@@ vis@@ m to ensure , among other th@@ ings , that as in@@ put pric@@ es dec@@ line , the benefit is fel@@ t by the population . 
and reducing the age of el@@ ig@@ ib@@ ility for old age pen@@ sion to 6@@ 0 years for men . 
prepar@@ ing for the implementation of the African Y@@ ou@@ th Char@@ ter once it has been proces@@ sed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Y@@ ou@@ th Development Ag@@ ency ; 
This improv@@ ement is m@@ ir@@ ror@@ ed in access to basic services â a rap@@ id dec@@ line in as@@ set poverty even pre@@ ced@@ ed the dec@@ line in mone@@ y-@@ met@@ ric poverty . 
But ne@@ i@@ ther can there be doub@@ t that the challenges remain im@@ men@@ se . 
Both in the G@@ 2@@ 0 meetings and other inter@@ actions in multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions , our government has ar@@ gu@@ ed for appropriate 
Y@@ et access to employment we@@ igh@@ s heav@@ ily on rural women , youth and people with dis@@ ability . 
and global scale , not only to st@@ em the impact of the cri@@ sis ; 
What , on the sur@@ face , started off as a financial cri@@ sis among a few len@@ ding institutions has explo@@ ded into a global credit c@@ run@@ ch , 
I have taken a mom@@ ent here to rest , to ste@@ al a view of the g@@ lor@@ ious vi@@ st@@ a that sur@@ r@@ ounds me , to look back on the di@@ stance I have come . 
and to that we can att@@ ach no pric@@ e ! 
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , al@@ though the reduc@@ tions in poverty have been substan@@ tial , ag@@ g@@ reg@@ ate in@@ equ@@ ality increased during the 199@@ 0@@ s . 
The reduc@@ tion is to a large extent due to a dra@@ matic expan@@ sion in social gr@@ ants expen@@ dit@@ ure from 200@@ 2 on@@ wards . 
inten@@ si@@ fying the campaign to sa@@ ve energy , so as to manage the current difficul@@ ties and change our own behavi@@ our , 
and urg@@ ent interven@@ tions particularly in the developed countries wh@@ ence the cri@@ sis orig@@ inated and where it is most sever@@ e . 
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hard@@ ly dif@@ fer regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
integr@@ ating into the work of the relevant C@@ lu@@ sters the fin@@ dings of research on Sec@@ ond E@@ con@@ om@@ y interven@@ tions such as the community works programme , support for small and mic@@ ro-@@ enterpri@@ ses and rural development initiatives ; 
Our special congrat@@ ul@@ ations to the government and people of Cu@@ ba on this the 5@@ 0@@ th ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary of the at@@ tain@@ ment of their so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty 
In re@@ ality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity 
While the number of grant benef@@ ici@@ aries was 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ -@@ milli@@ on in 199@@ 9 , by 200@@ 8 this had increased to 12@@ ,@@ 4@@ -@@ milli@@ on . 
We will as always se@@ ek to strengthen co@@ operation with these and other countries in pursu@@ it of that which is good for human@@ ity . 
We are tr@@ uly hear@@ ten@@ ed that , yester@@ day , the Zimbab@@ we@@ an Parliament passed A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 1@@ 9 of the Constitution , la@@ ying the basis for the install@@ ation of an inclu@@ sive government . 
These difficul@@ ties have co@@ in@@ ci@@ ded with a period in which inf@@ l@@ ation and interest rates are still too high . 
and also encourage development fin@@ ance institutions to assist fir@@ ms in di@@ st@@ res@@ s because of the cri@@ sis . 
It is a matter of pr@@ ou@@ d record that , for inst@@ ance 
But I can rest only for a mom@@ ent , for with freedom comes responsib@@ ilities , and I d@@ are not l@@ ing@@ er , for my long wal@@ k is not yet ended . 
In this regard , Hon@@ our@@ able Members , I am happ@@ y to report that in the inter@@ actions between The Presid@@ ency and leaders of various social partners , 
In this regard , we have through legislation , international conven@@ tions , regul@@ ations 
F@@ ur@@ ther , our anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment programme is not only the larg@@ est in the world ; 
Th@@ rou@@ gh adv@@ oc@@ acy campaign@@ s and inde@@ ed as a result of the partnerships we have buil@@ t with organisations re@@ presenting these vulner@@ able groups , we have improved awareness around issues that af@@ fect them ; 
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , m@@ iti@@ g@@ ating actions can be under@@ taken within the private sector to counter@@ act an ex@@ ces@@ sive investment s@@ low@@ down and un@@ necessary clo@@ su@@ res of production lin@@ es or plants . 
Al@@ ong with other countries of the South we will continue to pursu@@ e the cause of the re@@ struc@@ turing of the United Nations , the International Mon@@ et@@ ary Fun@@ d 
and our under@@ -@@ 2@@ 0 s@@ occ@@ er team did quite well in an extre@@ mel@@ y competi@@ tive environment . 
O@@ ver these years , it has become clear@@ er than ever before that there is much mut@@ ual benefit to be ga@@ ined from our partnership . 
public works programmes , sector partnerships and strateg@@ ies , local pro@@ cu@@ rement , small enterpri@@ se promotion and support for co@@ oper@@ atives ; 
This , and this in the main , is the sour@@ ce of our confi@@ dence when we say that the n@@ ation is in a good state . 
These and other programmes , including the A@@ pe@@ x Pri@@ or@@ ities identified in the State of the N@@ ation Ad@@ dres@@ s last F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary , 
Mad@@ ame Speak@@ er and Hon@@ our@@ able Chair@@ person ; 
and cri@@ mes against women and children have not ab@@ ated in any significant meas@@ ure , is a matter of great concern . 
Govern@@ ments social programmes have also improved the as@@ set base of the poor , in the form of housing â with 2@@ ,@@ 6@@ -@@ milli@@ on subsi@@ di@@ sed hou@@ ses provided . 
lower dem@@ and has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated a sc@@ al@@ ing down of production ; 
On the one hand , plans to exp@@ and employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law@@ -@@ enforc@@ ement ag@@ encies will continue . 
These immedi@@ ate measures will be informed by the princip@@ le of a counter@@ -@@ cyc@@ lic@@ al f@@ is@@ cal policy . 
I@@ ron@@ ically , prec@@ is@@ ely where education is most needed to help bre@@ ak the cyc@@ le of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teach@@ er capacity are least im@@ pres@@ sive . 
The sc@@ our@@ ge of crime remains a major sour@@ ce of in@@ security for South Africans . 
HIV imp@@ acts most sever@@ ely on young women . 
We can dec@@ ry the gre@@ ed , the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ mis@@ m and the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of manag@@ ers of bi@@ g corpor@@ ations which pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the cri@@ sis . 
cre@@ ating more job@@ s , better job@@ s and dec@@ ent work for all through higher rates of investment , 
We also comm@@ it our@@ selves to meet the objectives of international agre@@ ements , including 
For inst@@ ance , access to pot@@ able water has improved from 6@@ 2 in 199@@ 6 to 8@@ 8 in 200@@ 8 ; 
In this regard , how we position our country to take advant@@ age of uni@@ que opportunities that have come our way , will be of par@@ amount importance . 
recogn@@ ising that in addition to the consequ@@ ences of climate change , resources such as f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els and water are dec@@ lin@@ ing in the same meas@@ ure as dem@@ and is increasing ; 
to create a un@@ ited , n@@ on@@ racial , n@@ on@@ sex@@ ist , democratic and pro@@ sp@@ erous society that pla@@ ys a positive role in building a better world . 
Fir@@ stly , mone@@ y-@@ met@@ ric poverty dec@@ lin@@ ed substan@@ ti@@ ally since the turn of the cent@@ ury . 
We still have a long way to go . 
As part of the many deta@@ iled projects contain@@ ed in the governments Program@@ me of Ac@@ tion , we will pay particular atten@@ tion to : 
In this regard , where necessary , we will find cre@@ ative ways to ra@@ ise funds . 
addres@@ sing the investment challenge by improv@@ ing sa@@ v@@ ings , appropri@@ ately de@@ plo@@ ying resources from pen@@ sion 
I have wal@@ ked that long road to freedom . 
Y@@ et many health facilities do not always have the required medic@@ ines , appropriate staf@@ f@@ ing levels , 
Y@@ et , in being br@@ ut@@ ally self-@@ critical , we should not lo@@ se si@@ ght of the fact that what we are asses@@ sing is a system that enjo@@ ys , by far , better leg@@ iti@@ mac@@ y than ever experi@@ enced in our country . 
It points to we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses in the effici@@ ency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
which increased from 3@@ 4@@ -@@ thous@@ and benef@@ ici@@ aries in 199@@ 9 to 8@@ ,@@ 1@@ -@@ milli@@ on in 200@@ 8 . 
We shall also continue to pay special atten@@ tion to the challenge of anti@@ competi@@ tive behavi@@ our on the part of some of our corpor@@ ations . 
and to inten@@ si@@ fy the fight against crime and cor@@ ruption . 
and facilit@@ ating the processes aimed at strength@@ ening the machin@@ er@@ ies dealing with matters of gender equ@@ ality such as 5@@ 0@@ /@@ 50 represent@@ ation 
This sugg@@ ests that the poverty situation has improved re@@ mar@@ k@@ ably , particularly among people experi@@ encing the gre@@ at@@ est de@@ g@@ ree of wel@@ f@@ are de@@ priv@@ ation . 
This will include support by our development fin@@ ance institutions and lo@@ an fin@@ ance from international ag@@ encies , 
These initiatives will be under@@ taken in order to exten@@ d rather than we@@ ak@@ en the de@@ ep set of relations that we enjo@@ y within the Southern African Custom@@ s Union . 
D@@ ail@@ y experience , in poor and af@@ flu@@ ent neighbour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ali@@ ke , is one of ap@@ preh@@ en@@ sion at the pos@@ sibility of viol@@ ent att@@ ack . 
As such , we have been forced to t@@ one down our for@@ ec@@ ast@@ s in terms of growth and job@@ -@@ cre@@ ation . 
form the bed@@ ro@@ ck of our efforts to conclud@@ e the popul@@ ar man@@ date and la@@ y the found@@ ation for the future . 
but in@@ equ@@ ality has not improved . 
Ho@@ we@@ ver , we will ensure that the levels of bor@@ row@@ ing by government are pr@@ ud@@ ent and sustainable . 
A@@ mong house@@ holds that include children , the number of house@@ holds repor@@ ting that a child went hun@@ gr@@ y dec@@ lin@@ ed dra@@ ma@@ tically between 200@@ 2 and 200@@ 6 . 
The fact that incidents of viol@@ ent robber@@ ies in house@@ holds and busines@@ ses have been on the increase ; 
We know too that South Africa is less sever@@ ely affected than many other countries . 
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , the dy@@ nam@@ ics under@@ lying the poverty and in@@ equ@@ ality tr@@ ends determine the b@@ road policy ou@@ tlo@@ ok poverty has dec@@ re@@ ased since the tran@@ si@@ tion , 
inten@@ si@@ fying efforts to rev@@ am@@ p the criminal justice system , including better for@@ en@@ sic capacity , 
Cri@@ tically , we should also saf@@ eg@@ u@@ ard the integr@@ ity of the world trade system , complete the current negoti@@ ations on the Do@@ ha R@@ ound of world trade negoti@@ ations , and ensure that development a@@ id is not sc@@ al@@ ed down . 
and food security measures specific@@ ally also to targ@@ et those either un@@ protec@@ ted by the Un@@ employment In@@ sur@@ ance Fun@@ d or who have ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted their benefits . 
But we do know that the reduc@@ tion has not been f@@ ast en@@ ough , not even at the 7@@ -@@ 10 rate that we set our@@ selves for various categories of contact crime . 
and the team that tir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly and pati@@ ently hel@@ ped to bring the process to a successful conclu@@ sion . 
and local action and implementation for development , including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services . 
In the same meas@@ ure , we will continue to work with other countries 
the cre@@ ation of job@@ s is neg@@ atively affected and in some sectors re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment has become a re@@ ality . 
rap@@ id increase in the number of detec@@ tives , op@@ ti@@ mal uti@@ l@@ isation of information and communic@@ ations technology , and better management of the courts ; 
We wish on this occa@@ sion to exten@@ d our congrat@@ ul@@ ations to the people and the lead@@ ership of Z@@ ambi@@ a , G@@ h@@ ana 
In education , we have seen a dro@@ p in the educ@@ ator : lear@@ ner r@@ ati@@ o ; 
All these are assign@@ ments for the coming period . 
On its part , government will ad@@ ap@@ t industrial fin@@ ancing and inc@@ en@@ tive instru@@ ments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , 
At the same time we will improve SAD@@ C@@ s inter@@ action with the Comm@@ on Mar@@ ket of East and Southern Africa and the East African Community . 
and de@@ vi@@ se respon@@ ses that will minim@@ ise their impact especially on the most vulner@@ able sectors of our society . 
in using the f@@ is@@ c@@ us as an instru@@ ment of re@@ distribution and shar@@ ing the bur@@ den of providing public goods . 
The leng@@ th of time towards at@@ taining a higher tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tor@@ y may have been stre@@ t@@ ched some@@ what . 
In@@ de@@ ed , over the past 1@@ 5 years we have spar@@ ed no effor@@ t to ensure that Africa 
G@@ ini@@ el de V@@ il@@ li@@ ers and his team have w@@ on the D@@ ak@@ ar R@@ ally ; 
In@@ de@@ ed , these ob@@ serv@@ ations are confir@@ med by our own research , which show@@ s that income poverty especially among African 
that is , a stable and leg@@ iti@@ mate government ge@@ ar@@ ed to address the challenges that the people face . 
cre@@ ating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the s@@ pher@@ es of government , including national strategic planning ; 
We are confi@@ dent that , because it car@@ es , the international community will part@@ ner the people of Zimbabwe as they b@@ la@@ ze out along a new tra@@ il . 
continu@@ ing with the W@@ ar on P@@ over@@ ty campaign and fin@@ alising the dra@@ ft of the Com@@ prehensive An@@ ti@@ -@@ poverty Str@@ ateg@@ y through the public consult@@ ations now under way ; 
as we fin@@ alise the multi@@ lat@@ eral negoti@@ ations on the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Par@@ t@@ nership Agre@@ ements with countries in our region . 
We are pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed that this year we conclud@@ e celeb@@ r@@ ations of the first dec@@ ad@@ e of our diplom@@ atic relations with the Pe@@ op@@ les Republic of China . 
Our challenge is to trans@@ l@@ ate these vi@@ sions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
These ide@@ als are shar@@ ed by vir@@ tually all of human@@ ity , as reflec@@ ted in the United Nations Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ als . 
in enterpri@@ se development and so on in part makes our country a l@@ ag@@ gar@@ d in the high growth stak@@ es . 
deliver@@ ing the ul@@ tim@@ ate pri@@ ze that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the sub@@ continent as a whole : 
is cer@@ tain@@ ly going to perform well below its ac@@ tual potential . 
I am certain that Hon@@ our@@ able Members will ag@@ ree that the human@@ ity of our democratic disp@@ ens@@ ation 
as@@ ser@@ ting her hope and her res@@ ili@@ ence on the world stage . 
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaign@@ s on child im@@ mun@@ isation and n@@ utri@@ tion . 
9@@ 5 of South Africans now live within 5 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ res of a health facility ; 
and mal@@ ari@@ a cases have mas@@ sively dec@@ lin@@ ed . 
F@@ our@@ th@@ ly , government will susta@@ in and exp@@ and social expen@@ dit@@ ure , including progres@@ sively exten@@ ding access to the child support grant to children of 1@@ 8 years of age 
All kin@@ ds of statistics can be c@@ ited to att@@ est to this . 
Spec@@ ial men@@ tion in this regard is due to SADC facilit@@ ator , former President Tha@@ bo Mbe@@ ki 
I have made mis@@ step@@ s along the way . 
I will ho@@ we@@ ver c@@ ite a few inst@@ ances again to s@@ ket@@ ch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . 
Chil@@ d im@@ mun@@ isation cover@@ age has ste@@ adi@@ ly increased to about 8@@ 5 ; 
The dep@@ th of our dis@@ appointment at the recent es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict and mas@@ sive loss of life , of especially civili@@ ans â including children , women and the el@@ der@@ ly â inde@@ ed de@@ fi@@ es des@@ cription . 
and provi@@ dent funds , housing , financial sector contri@@ bu@@ tions and black economic em@@ power@@ ment ; 
On this we still have some way to go . 
That depend@@ s on all of us ; 
Spec@@ ial ac@@ col@@ ad@@ es are due to our c@@ ric@@ ket team which has cli@@ m@@ bed to the ape@@ x of global ran@@ k@@ ings . 
But be@@ y@@ ond this , the tr@@ ue legacy of this spec@@ t@@ ac@@ le will be in our ability to show@@ case South African and African hospit@@ ality and human@@ ity â 
access to fin@@ ance and inf@@ low@@ s of capital have tur@@ ned for the wor@@ se ; 
and other multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions so they reflec@@ t the chang@@ ed and chang@@ ing global re@@ ality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transpar@@ ent manner . 
In this respect , there is urg@@ ent need to assist in dealing with the human@@ itarian cri@@ sis in that country . 
O@@ f course , the overall crime rate , having peak@@ ed in 200@@ 2 , has consist@@ ently dec@@ lin@@ ed . 
We can con@@ dem@@ n the policies of governments which took their e@@ y@@ es off the b@@ all and allowed the rap@@ ac@@ ious licence of un@@ regul@@ ated market@@ s to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on financial systems . 
sub@@ mit@@ ting the SADC Pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on G@@ ender and Development to Parliament ; 
Com@@ b@@ ined , these develop@@ ments bo@@ de ill for the re@@ ven@@ ues we need to exp@@ and the provision of services and to imple@@ ment our infrastructure projects . 
J@@ ust two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mal@@ i part of the ar@@ chi@@ ves to pre@@ serve the anci@@ ent man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts of T@@ im@@ bu@@ k@@ t@@ u . 
The fact that the private sector l@@ ag@@ s behind in chang@@ ing the de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ics of management and sk@@ illed occup@@ ations , 
This rich her@@ it@@ age points to Africa as a be@@ ac@@ on of science and liter@@ at@@ ure , ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ y and comm@@ er@@ ce , inter@@ rup@@ ted by the sla@@ ve trade and the sc@@ ram@@ ble for Afric@@ as we@@ alth . 
experi@@ ences her renew@@ al in what should in ac@@ tual practice be the African Cent@@ ury . 
But we are all too aware that , because we are str@@ ong@@ ly integrated into the world economy , dem@@ and for our expor@@ ts has dec@@ lin@@ ed ; 
These are the issues that the comprehensive rev@@ am@@ p of the criminal justice system has started to address . 
V@@ ir@@ tually all the projects and plans are completed or near@@ ing comple@@ tion â from stadi@@ a , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommod@@ ation , to health and im@@ mig@@ ration plans â 
but it is expan@@ ding all the time , with over 6@@ 9@@ 0 00@@ 0 pati@@ ents having been initi@@ ated on anti@@ ret@@ ro@@ vir@@ al treatment since the commen@@ c@@ ement of the programme . 
We also wish in this regard to congrat@@ ul@@ ate all our spor@@ ting team@@ s which have as@@ ser@@ ted South Afric@@ as pursu@@ it of excell@@ ence over the past year . 
We look forward to further strength@@ ening this partnership when we host the South Afric@@ a-@@ EU Summit later this year . 
We should of course ac@@ knowledge that the land re@@ distribution programme as well as po@@ st-@@ settle@@ ment support could have been hand@@ led fa@@ ster and better . 
These then are some of the adv@@ ances that democracy has brought ; 
adv@@ ancing equ@@ ity , developing skills , cre@@ ating economic opportunities and exten@@ ding services ; 
While our approach@@ es may dif@@ fer , the objectives that we need to aim for are clear@@ ly and un@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ously set out in our Constitution : 
I thank you . 
But let us not del@@ ude our@@ selves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its n@@ as@@ cent st@@ ages . 
if not dec@@ ad@@ es , as a consequ@@ ence of the economic cri@@ sis that has eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the global v@@ ill@@ age . 
We are also hear@@ ten@@ ed that research into HIV pre@@ val@@ ence demonstr@@ ates stabil@@ isation and a s@@ light reduc@@ tion in rates of infec@@ tion . 
This is because of the transformation these institutions have under@@ gone , in terms of their doc@@ tr@@ ines based on a human rights cul@@ ture , their de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ic com@@ position , and their systems of account@@ ability . 
At the same time , much effor@@ t has been put into improv@@ ing infrastructure in poor areas . 
but , hop@@ eful@@ ly , also with regard to political di@@ alogu@@ e . 
and an improv@@ ement in the number of p@@ up@@ ils pas@@ sing ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , to qu@@ ote a few exam@@ ples . 
And we do hope that this time r@@ ound , the renew@@ ed efforts of the international community to find a las@@ ting sol@@ ution to this conflict will be@@ ar fru@@ it , 
we agreed jo@@ in@@ tly to de@@ vi@@ se interven@@ tions that would minim@@ ise the impact of this cri@@ sis on our society .
