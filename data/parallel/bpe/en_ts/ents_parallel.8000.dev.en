we must re@@ vi@@ ve their interest in the political process . 
That has now been done . 
Companies face the threat of liqu@@ id@@ ation . 
Ladies and gentlemen , a vision without a con@@ cre@@ te Plan of Action is a de@@ ad vision . 
Thank you , Cha@@ ir . 
We have discussed the matter with the labour movement . 
Why do I ask this question ? 
Describe the meeting .

on what you have presented . 
there have been some significant changes . 
R@@ et@@ ur@@ n of income from invest@@ ments 
There are areas that are open to improvement . 
This is the initi@@ al step in a longer term review of public expenditure . 
E@@ quality of opportunity is still not a reality . 
The third point is to ask what we did . 
S@@ mal@@ l business support 
Application for motor trade permit and number
Improv@@ ing financial governance . 
The general out@@ cr@@ y is that all the initiatives do not reach the rural communities . 
Phase 4 is concerned with the nu@@ ts and b@@ ol@@ ts that will ensure that the planned activities become a reality .

Yes , I will ad@@ mit currently there are problems . 
Indeed , we think the problem lies el@@ se@@ where . 
N@@ ur@@ ses are at the heart of the country's health system and play an important role in deli@@ ver@@ ing an effective health@@ care service .

I cannot go to all of them . 
However , conditions of employment are a provincial compet@@ ence . 
We must pres@@ s ahead with a ban on these we@@ ap@@ ons .

Any particular reason why ?

As a nation , we should also now come together to fight crime . 
3 . S@@ end a copy of the import permit to the ex@@ por@@ ter / suppli@@ er .
Ref@@ er to the under@@ lin@@ ed words in paragraph 2 .

The date of the depart@@ mental tri@@ al is set for 200@@ 7@@ -@@ 0@@ 3@@ -@@ 15 .

I wish to ask a question regarding the agenda . 
Application to import animals or animal products into the RSA ( sub@@ jec@@ ted to further control ) .
And of course I want to thank all three rapporte@@ urs . 
The application is process@@ ed on the same day , but the ref@@ und is only paid out after a few days due to internal au@@ di@@ ting processes .
Sub@@ si@@ dies must however be pha@@ sed out in the long term . 
We promise that the project will proce@@ ed and will be completed as planned . 
but how we say it . 
In certain countries , the situation is ala@@ r@@ ming , however .
