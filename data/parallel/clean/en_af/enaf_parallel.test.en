Home > Directories > Projects > Health > HIV/Aids > 100 Day Deposits: A Healthy Home for All
Health was improved in the first 100 days, by
* Increasing the number of patients on anti-retroviral treatment
* Improving services at problem Community Health Centres
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT
The largest treatment site is at Tygerberg Hospital, where 464 patients are receiving treatment.
The Western Cape ARV programme aims to establish 36 accredited ARV treatment sites by March 2005 and to provide daily ARV treatment to 6,000 patients (estimated to be half of those in need of treatment) by March 2005.
Patients have to meet certain criteria - both medical and psychosocial - before they are given ARV treatment.
Medically, the criteria are:
* World Health Organisation (WHO) stage 4 disease (except for tuberculosis) OR
* WHO stage 1, 2 and 3 and tuberculosis patients with CD4 count WHO stage 1, 2 and 3 and tuberculosis patients with CD4 count < 200 cells / mmÂ³
Psychosocially, the criteria are:
* Demonstrated reliability, that is, attended three or more scheduled visits to an HIV clinic.
* No active alcohol or substance abuse.
* No untreated active depression.
* Disclosure - it is highly recommended that patients either have disclosed their status to at least one friend or family member or have joined a support group.
* Insight - patients need to have accepted their HIV positive status, and have insight into the consequences of HIV infection and the role of ARV treatment.
* Ability to attend - patients must be able to attend the anti-retroviral centre on a regular basis (transport can be arranged for patients living far from the treatment site).
Each patient is treated in line with the standard Provincial Government of the Western Cape Anti-retroviral Treatment Protocol.
The protocol includes a first line of Stavudine (d4T), Lamivudine (3TC), Efavirenz (EFZ) or Nevirapine (NVP) and a second line of Didanosine (ddI), Zidovudine (AZT), Lopinavir / Ritonivar (LPV/r) ARV treatment regimen.
The Department will evaluate the different models of community support and formalise community support in the next financial year.
There are also three contracted organisations offering ARV therapy training to public health care workers in the Western Cape.
* Foundation for Professional Development (FPD)
* Medicines Information Centre (MIC), University of Cape Town
* web-based training (Steve Andrews and Associates)
The ARV Treatment Programme forms part of the National Comprehensive HIV and AIDS plan for which the Western Cape has been allocated R23.081 million for 2004/2005.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has an allocation of R24.9 million, which will be made available for the period August 2004 to July 2005 for the ARV programme at five ARV sites in the Cape Metropole.
IMPROVEMENTS AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES
The communities of Elsies River, Delft, Hanover Park, Retreat, Bonteheuwel/Langa, Gugulethu, Mitchells Plain, Kraaifontein and Khayelitsha are benefiting from the delivery of an improved health service at their community health centres, as promised by the Premier.
Innovations, including an appointment system, a fast lane for medicine collection and a club system for chronic stable patients, have reduced the long waiting times usually experienced at these centres.
The club system for chronic stable patients involves the staff at the clinics making four- or six- monthly appointments for those patients who are on the club system.
Patients are however advised that if they feel unwell they should not wait for their club appointment, but visit the nearest Community Health Centre (CHC) immediately.
The Department of Health has committed itself to the regular supply of medication.
Patients will no longer be sent home with an IOU slip to return the next day to collect their medication.
Facility Managers have also been appointed at most clinics to ensure that that all the changes implemented will run smoothly.
The Delft Community Health Centre (now known as the CHC of Excellence) takes great pride in a shelter built especially for community members to make their visit to the CHC more pleasant and comfortable.

Successful farmers who wish to expand their operations may apply for further grants, but the total of LRAD grants to one applicant may not exceed R100 000, this is called graduation where one graduates from a small scale farming to commercial farming.
LRAD grant is not repayable, it is not a loan.
To qualify for a grant of R20 000, you have to make an input of R5 000.
The input does not have to be in the form of cash â it can also take the form of farming equipment, livestock and other agricultural assets, as well as the labour.
The following need to accompany your application:
a land use proposal or farm plan , if present and if not there, the office will assist in the development of one
an option to sell with an agreed price, if leasing with an option to buy
a list of household members or group members and their identification, if the proposal is for a group
a valuation report, if present and if not there, the office will assist in the development of one.
Provision of Land Assistance Act, 1993
Under normal circumstances the process might take a minimum of four months, and can also take longer depending on the complexity of some projects.
A minimum amount of R20 000 will require a minimum own contribution amount of R5 000.
A maximum amount of R100 000 will require a maximum own contribution amount of R400 000.
Between the minimum and maximum amounts, there is a continuum of grant amounts, depending on the participant's own contribution.
You will be given a form to complete at the provincial office of the Department of Land Affairs or at the local agricultural extension office.

HOW TO COMPLETE A TENDER OR BID
Each tender or bid advert indicates where you can collect the documents you will need to fill in to submit your tender, and where they should be submitted.
The advert also indicates a closing date.
This is a very firm deadline - no late tenders can be accepted.
Each tender has a number of associated forms, which must accompany the tender you submit.
The specific forms you require for your tender should be listed in the tender documentation.
You should consider very carefully how you fill in these forms.
Get advice if you are unsure of anything.
TENDER OR BID FORMS
1. National and Provincial Tender Forms or Bid Documents
2. Western Cape Provincial Construction Tender Forms
3. Local Government Tender Forms
1. NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL TENDER FORMS OR BID DOCUMENTS
Each tender or bid has a number of associated forms, which must accompany the tender or bid you submit.
These used to be known as 'tender forms' and are now called 'bid documents'.
These bid documents have the prefix SBD and WCBD for national and provincial bid documents respectively.
The forms usually required for national and provincial tenders (except Provincial construction tenders) are the following:
In this document you agree to be bound by the tender or bid terms and conditions.
Your taxes must be in order to be a successful with your tender or bid.
This document has an 'Application for tax clearance certificate' form attached to it.
You have to complete this form and hand it in at your nearest South Engican Revenue Services (SARS) office, to get a tax clearance certificate.
You must then attach the original tax clearance certificate that you get from SARS, to the tender or bid documents.
This certificate serves as proof that you are not in arrears with your tax payments.
Which of these documents you complete depends on the subject of the tender.
In this form, you motivate your price, by describing the product you will supply or the experience of the person who will perform the service.
This is the document in which you declare whether or not you have a relationship (friend, family, business) with anyone who works for government.
This is so that those people are not involved in awarding the tender in any way, to avoid corruption.
Any contract having an imported content equivalent to or exceeding US$ 10 million has an industrial participation (IP) obligation, which must be addressed in the tender.
You must fill in the SBD 6.1 form for provincial tenders even if you are not claiming any of the preference points.
If you are claiming preference points, you need to fill in those of 12 documents SBD /WCBD 6.1-6.12 which relate to kinds of points you are claiming (national and provincial) as explained above.
This is the contract that binds the parties should the tender be successful.
There is a different form for purchases (7.1, services 7.2 or sales 7.3)
There may be other forms to fill in for a specific tender or bid.
These should be included with the tender or bid documents that you receive.
However, a typical tender or bid package will probably have the following documents:
* SBD 1 - WCBD 1
* SBD 2 - WCBD 2 (Tax Certificate)
* SBD 3.3 - WCBD 3.3 (Pricing schedule: Professional services)
* SBD 4 - WCBD 4 (Declaration of interest)
* SBD 6.1 - WCBD 6.1 (Preferential procurement points)
* SBD 6.10 - WCBD 6.10 (Preferential points- local area)
* SBD 6.3 - WCBD 6.3 ( Preferential points - SMME)
* SBD 6.4 - WCBD 6.4 (Preferential points - local content)
* SBD 6.9 - WCBD 6.9 (Preferential points - WC Province)
* SBD 7.1 - WCBD 7.1 (Contract purchase)
* SBD 7.2 - WCBD 7.2 (Contract services)
Annexure A - GCC (General Conditions of Contract) draws special attention to certain general conditions applicable to government bids, contracts and orders; and ensures that clients are familiar with the rights and obligations of all parties involved in doing business with government.
2. WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL CONSTRUCTION TENDER FORMS
For provincial construction-related tenders the usual forms are a little different; new construction "bid" forms are also in the process of being developed in 2004:
* Tender declaration
* General conditions for construction tenders DPW6
* Additional particulars DPW.7E
* Declaration of interest DPW.57E
* Financial particulars
* Application for tax clearance certificate WCBD2.
* Preference certificate WCBD6.1.
Again, there may be additional forms to complete, which will be included with the tender documents.
3. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TENDER OR BID FORMS
At local level, each council may have its own forms, which you should enquire about directly.
HOW TENDERS OR BIDS ARE AWARDED
The document SBD / WCBD 6.1 explains how tenders or bids are decided.
WCBD says:
* The bidder obtaining the highest number of points will be awarded the contract.
* Preference points shall be calculated after prices have been brought to a comparative basis.
* Points scored will be rounded off to 2 decimal places.
For example, if you have not indicated a price, your tender will be disqualified.
Smaller mistakes or omissions may or may not disqualify you from the tender process; this is a question of interpretation of the tender rules.
For example, if the rules say "may disqualify" rather than "must disqualify" for a specific mistake, it is up to the official doing the check to decide whether the mistake is important enough to this tender to disqualify you.
The next phase looks at compliance of the product or services with the specifications, and price.
Those which do not comply with the specifications are removed from the list, while all the tenders which comply with the specifications are listed in order of price.
Those that fall in the lowest price group are then considered in a lowest price tender list.
It is in this phase that the preference points come into play.
All the preference points claimed by those on the list of lowest price tenders are first verified.
Then the formula is applied to determine who of those on the lowest price list with verifiable points come out with the best result on points, and therefore who should be awarded the contract.
In other words, preference points only come into play after the most expensive tenders have first been excluded.
This is to ensure that the most expensive options do not win solely on points, and also to speed up the process, as only those on the lowest price list have their preference points verified.
The Tender Bulletin shows who has won previous tenders, listing the price and other factors taken into account in awarding the tender.

Some useful safety tips â¦
The Bathroom
The presence of water and the contents of your bathroom cabinet pose numerous risks to all members of your household.
* Never leave the hot tap running unattended.
* Children should never be left unsupervised in the bath.
* Store razors and personal hygiene products out of reach.
Lock away medicines.
* Don't allow any electrical appliances in the bathroom.
The Living Area
The area in which the family spends most of its time holds many potential hazards, particularly for young children.
* Use safety gates on stairways.
* Keep low, unbarred windows closed and restrict access to balconies.
* Safety glass should be used for large glass panes such as doors.
* Secure large furniture that could be tipped over and soften all sharp corners.
* Tidy away loose hanging blind cords and curtain tie-backs.
The Kitchen
The kitchen is a particularly hazardous area due to the presence of hot electrical appliances, toxic substances and sharp objects.
* Always turn the stove off at the main switch.
* Try to use the back plates of the stove and keep pot handles pointing inwards.
* Keep electrical cords short and out of reach.
* Household cleaners, polishes and insecticides should all be locked away.
* Keep knives and other sharp objects away from curious fingers.
The Bedroom
The bedroom may seem a safe place but there are a number of possible dangers.
* Don't allow children to play on bedroom furniture unattended.
Safe Storage
It is vitally important that the safety precautions you take inside the home are also applied outside.
* Keep any potential hazard out of the reach of children.
* Buy products that have resealable child safe closures.
* Keep products in their original boxes so that they can easily be identified.
* Store products such as turpentine, paint, fertilisers, gas cylinders and pool chemicals away from the general living area.
* Always read the storage instructions on the packs and make sure you separate incompatible products.
* Pool chlorine should be stored away from other products to prevent contamination.
* Make sure that the storage area is cool, dry and well ventilated.
* Do not reuse or refill empty containers.
DIY Safety
Its certainly not only children who need to be protected.
Taking short cuts and ignoring basic safety rules are often responsible for adult injuries around the home.
* Always use the tool designed for the task and ensure that it is put away once the job is finished.
* Sweep the work area when finished to prevent slips and falls.
* Wear the correct safety clothing, such as goggles, face masks, protective gloves or safety boots.
* Treat electricity with the care it deserves.
Always switch off the power at the fuse box before carrying out repairs.
* A ladder should always stand away from the wall at a distance of a quarter of the ladder's height and should never lean against glass or guttering.
* Always make sure a power tool is earthed and replace worn flex.
Water Safety
With the arrival of summer your pool becomes the centre of your family's activities.
Safety and hygiene are paramount to this area of your home.
* Never, ever leave children unsupervised around swimming pools, garden ponds, buckets of water or water features.
* Restrict access to swimming pools by the use of a pool fence or a pool safety net.
* Teach children to swim from as early as 12 months.
Contact âLearn to Swimâ on 0861 100 456.
* Don't allow children to push each other into the pool, run around the pool or hold each other under the water.
* Ensure that your pool water is sparkling blue and free from harmful bacteria by using a trusted sanitiser like HTH Classic.
* Contact HTH Pool Assist customer care line for further information 08600 222 40.

How Do I Tell my Daughter of my HIV Status?
Question: My friend was diagnosed with HIV 8yrs ago and is starting to get sick now.
She's a single parent and is worried about who will take care of her 12 yr old daughter when she dies.
She has asked me to take care of her daughter, and I will do so.
The problem is that she does not know how to tell her daughter she is HIV positive.
Is there anything I can do to help her?
Answer: The important thing for your friend to know is that there is plenty of time to think about and plan what needs to be done.
One of the hardest things HIV positive parents have to do is to tell their children they have the HIV virus.
Often they may be too afraid to talk to their children.
But this silence can be bad for everyone.
Children worry when they see that something is wrong and may blame themselves for their parent's sickness or worries.
They need to make the most of their time together.
It is not an easy thing for parents to tell their children that they are HIV positive.
Children may experience the same feelings that the parents felt when they first found out that they were HIV positive.
For example, they may have felt scared, angry or sad.
It should be remembered that these feelings are normal.
She needs to be given all the correct information about HIV and AIDS. (c) Your friend needs to be sensitive to her daughter's feelings and encourage her to talk about how she feels and especially her fears about HIV and AIDS.
It would also be important for your friend to ask another family member/s (whom she had already told previously) to be present after she discloses her HIV status to her daughter, to give her daughter a sense of who she is.
Your being there to offer support at this time would be good, as this would help to establish a bond between you and her daughter.
Allowing the young girl to share her feelings about her mother's HIV status with you would help her to feel supported.
This may make it easier for her to speak to you and the other family members about her mother after she has died.
She would need a lot of support now and especially at the time of her mother's death.
Support for her daughter would also give your friend peace of mind.
It may be useful for your friend and her daughter to establish a family tradition, something that they would enjoy doing on a regular basis.
This could take place once a week perhaps.
Another way to create a record of important memories could be to for them to make a memory box.
Your friend could also write a letter to her daughter telling her how much she loves her and adding this to the memory box to be opened after her death.
The daughter would probably find much comfort in having something tangible to remind her of her mother and the love they shared for each other.
Both your friend and her daughter need a great deal of support at this time, they are fortunate that you are prepared to be there as a support base for them during this difficult period in their lives.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can I Insist That Someone Has an HIV Test before Offering Them a Job?
Can I Insist That Someone Has an HIV Test before Offering Them a Job?
Question: I am going to start work next month and have arranged for a domestic worker to do the housework and look after my children aged 2 and 4.
I want her to have a blood test before she starts work because I am worried that she might have HIV and my children could get infected.
How do I go about making sure she gets tested?
Answer: Even if a person tests HIV negative before they start work, it is possible that they might become infected sometime in the future.
In South Africa it is illegal to insist that someone have an HIV test before offering them a job.
It is also illegal to dismiss anyone just because they are HIV positive.
Even if a person who is employed decides to have an HIV test, they are not legally bound to inform their employer of the result.
Should they do so, the employer is obliged to keep this information confidential.
Anyone who decides to be tested must receive counselling both before and after the test is done.
The person must also sign an informed consent form before blood can be taken for the test.
In practical terms this means that, before the test is done, the person will receive education about HIV/AIDS, discuss the risk of testing positive and explore how they think they might cope with either a positive or negative result.
The counsellor will determine why the person needs to be tested and inform him/her of their legal rights.
Should the person test HIV positive, the counsellor will explore how they can prevent transmission or the virus to others.
Human rights abuses have happened when employees were taken for blood tests, by their employers and without informed consent having been obtained.
This constitutes an assault.
Further, any health care worker who informs an employer of the employee's HIV status, without that person's consent, would be guilty of the serious offence of breaching confidentiality.
Many people are concerned about becoming infected with HIV themselves, or about possible risks to their children.
However, it is important to remember that HIV is not spread through casual contact.
If this were the case almost all of us would be positive by now as we are constantly in contact with infected people.
HIV is spread in three ways:
* unprotected sex with an infected person
* an HIV positive mother might infect her child during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding
* exposure to blood infected with HIV.
South Africa has one of the safest blood transfusion services in the world.
Further, we seldom come into contact with other people's blood.
The best way of preventing the spread of this disease is to arm yourself with knowledge and act accordingly.
Some domestic workers who have tested HIV positive have been in the fortunate position of being able to confide in their employers and receive support.
These employers recognise that people with HIV are also breadwinners and that it is the quality of their work, rather than their HIV status that is important.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Do I Come To Terms with an AIDS Death?
How Do I Come To Terms with an AIDS Death?
I feel so badly about it all.
Why did she not tell me?
What can I do?
Answer: Your sadness at the death of your best friend is evident.
One of the hardest things in life is to lose a dear friend, especially when there is unfinished business between you.
HIV Infection has created a situation of distrust, sometimes even in the closest relationships.
One of the reasons for this has been the terrible stigma associated with this illness.
It is this stigma that has caused people with HIV and AIDS not to share the knowledge of their status with others, even those nearest and dearest.
Receiving an HIV positive result inevitably causes a crisis for the person being told such news.
Regardless of how good the counselling is that one receives, we should never underestimate the severity of the shock a person feels upon being told that the HIV test result is positive.
The Counsellor herself or himself is not unaffected by the result s/he has to give.
The Counsellors one meets at the Community Health Centres have received very intensive and specific counselling training which enables them to do the work that they do.
Many of them have been counselling for a long time and are very experienced.
They are able to provide the necessary compassionate support and accurate information in order to obtain informed consent from their clients prior to the test being done, and to contain the person's emotions once the result is known.
It is of the utmost importance that people should never agree to an HIV test without first receiving the necessary Pre and Post Test Counselling from a trained counsellor.
It is by way of the above explanation that I hope to reassure you that while your friend may have chosen not to confide her HIV positive status to you, she would have received the best possible support during counselling and testing.
While I do not wish to minimise the intensity of your pain and bewilderment at the fact that your friend died of AIDS related complications without divulging her HIV status to you, I would like to explain what happens to a person when s/he receives an HIV positive result.
A positive diagnosis generates deep emotions within the person receiving the result.
The crisis generated from this experience could last for many weeks while the person concerned comes to terms with the news and works through the feelings and possible consequences of what being HIV positive means in terms of one's self, one's loved ones (family and friends) and others.
When one is given a positive result one goes into shock because it can be the most devastating experience ever.
Often the shock is so great that afterwards, all the person remembers is that s/he is HIV positive.
Another deep emotion that comes to the fore is fear.
Fear of what might happen to one, fear of the future, fear of rejection by family, friends, fear of causing hurt to one's loved ones by imparting the news to them.
Speaking from many years of experience as a Counsellor, I have yet to meet a client who at some stage does not think about the effect that breaking the news of his/her HIV positive status will have on loved ones and what the consequences might be.
Anger, disappointment and sometimes guilt often play major roles in the kind of decisions people make around informing loved ones.
These feelings are often directed at self.
Again it is important for the person to discuss these feelings in a safe and supportive environment.
The people living with HIV are vulnerable, both physically and emotionally.
They sometimes choose to share their vulnerability with a trained counsellor, rather than with close family or friends because to do so would be too overwhelming.
It is hard to be strong for loved ones when one is feeling fragile.
So people may choose to share their concerns and issues with a counsellor, where they are assured of a safe place; the space to ventilate feelings without reservation; where negative and positive feelings will be contained with respect, a non-judgmental attitude and unconditional compassion.
One of the greatest fears people have is that they will lose the necessary support base provided by family and friends.
The threat of this support being jeopard-ised, often drives people to keep silent about their HIV status.
I understand that you have questions that might never be answered.
May I suggest you give yourself permission to feel sad, angry, hurt.
It will not help to suppress your feelings.
At some point you may deem it appropriate to do something tangible, like visit her grave, or do something that you both enjoyed doing together that holds good memories.
You will find, with time that: "Grief never diminishes, it only erupts less often.".
If necessary talk to a Counsellor.

What Do I Need To Consider before Disclosing my HIV Positive Status To Close Friends and Family?
Question: What would somebody who is thinking about disclosing his/her HIV positive status to close friends and family need to consider?
Answer: Making the decision to inform close friends and family about your HIV status can be very difficult for somebody who is HIV positive.
There are many things to consider before doing so, as well as different emotions that you may need to work through.
The decision to disclose can be at times scary, exhausting and liberating, and sometimes these emotions can be experienced all at once.
Although research has shown that support from family and friends is of tremendous benefit to somebody who is HIV positive, the process of disclosure itself can be very stressful.
Somebody who is thinking about informing loved ones that he/she is HIV positive may have various questions: Who will I disclose to?
How will people react?
When is the best time to disclose?
You are the best person to answer these questions for yourself, but the following pointers may help.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Why Do You Always Have To Use Condoms while Using Antiretroviral Drugs?
Why Do You Always Have To Use Condoms while Using Antiretroviral Drugs?
Question: My sister has just started using Antiretroviral drugs and I am concerned because I think I will have to start on them soon myself.
She told me that her Counsellor said that everybody who takes these drugs always have to use condoms.
Why?
Answer: What your sister told you is true.
If you do not always use a condom correctly, you stand the chance of developing drug resistant strains of HIV.
This means that the drugs will not work anymore against the virus.
The viral load will increase and the CD4 cells (white cells) which is our immune system, will start to drop.
This situation will lead to a drug resistant strain and the virus will manage to produce more of itself.
If this happened, the drugs would be ineffective.
The resistant strain would then become stronger and multiply in the body.
Resistance to one drug (because of not using condoms) could also prevent other classes of drugs from working.
If you do not commit yourself to use condoms consistently and correctly, you could infect those people, with whom you have unprotected penetrative sex, with this drug resistant strain of the virus.
That means that those people whom you may have infected, will not be able to take those drugs at the time that they are ready to do so, even though they have not taken ARVs before, because they started out with drug resistant strains.
When someone is ready to start ARV therapy, it is necessary for that person to go to the ARV clinic to see the doctor, who after assessment will decide whether the person's health warrants Antiretroviral therapy.
The doctor will then refer the person to the Counsellor.
The Counsellor will spend time with that person in private and explain everything concerning the ARV drugs, such as, adherence, diet, living a positive lifestyle etc. The Counsellor will also answer all questions that the client may have concerning ARV therapy.
It will also be necessary, thereafter, for the person to attend groups sessions as advised by the Counsellor.
This does not mean that you will be required to discuss your personal issues in the presence of other people, but it enables you to learn about many issues around ARVs in a safe environment.
Following the group sessions, there will also be other individual (face to face) counselling opportunities with the Counsellor, where personal issues and difficulties regarding ARVs may be discussed in private.
In between these various sessions, a client is free to contact the Counsellor should problems arise, whether those problems have to do with such issues as condom use or anything else related to ARVs.
Whether you are ready to be started on ARV drugs, or not, it is necessary for you to be committed to the consistent use of condoms.
Your decision to do so will not only benefit society but equally importantly, it will protect you from getting resistant strains of the virus now and in the future.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Advice and Counselling on HIV and AIDS are Available for Small And Medium Sized Businesses?
What Advice and Counselling on HIV and AIDS are Available for Small And Medium Sized Businesses?
Question: I run a smallish business with only eighteen employees.
I keep hearing about the effect of HIV/AIDS on business but I have no idea what I should be doing about it.
In any case all my staff appear to be in good health.
What advice can you give me?
Answer: If you have eighteen employees, statistics suggest that there may be three or four infected with the HI virus.
If infected employees are in an early stage of the illness they are unlikely to be showing any signs of infection as yet.
However, if they are ignorant of their status and are therefore not acting appropriately, you may find in a year or two, that several of your key workers become ill at more or less the same time.
For this and other important reasons it is very desirable that all your staff are provided with HIV information and are given the opportunity to be voluntarily counselled and tested to establish whether they are HIV positive.
It is against the law for any company to test employees without voluntary informed consent (1) practice pre-employment testing or
(2) to test existing employees without their informed consent (voluntary agreement to be tested after appropriate pre-test counselling).
Having said that, you do need informed advice as to how to go about encouraging your staff to access voluntary counselling and testing.
To begin with it must be recognized that staff have the right to full confidentiality about their status.
In other words, even if they test positive, they are not under any obligation to disclose this to you.
Often the best way to begin is to ask a qualified person to meet with you so that you can together agree on a HIV Workplace Policy which includes an education strategy suited to the particular needs of your business.
The Workplace policy needs to be formulated by a task group which is fully representative in terms of the management, workers, shop stewards and union representatives.
The next step might be for you to access experts who could implement your HIV/AIDS information education for your workforce outlining the main issues involved in HIV counselling and testing.
The purpose of this is to inform and to correct misinformation whilst encouraging individuals to scrutinize their own attitudes and behaviour in order to make an informed decision as to whether or not they should take an HIV test.
You need to be quite clear as to what your policy is with regard to HIV positive staff who are at all stages of the infection and the implications for other staff members and the company.
The aims of an HIV/AIDS programme should include minimising the risk of infection as well as keeping already infected staff in a state of good health.
Legally, employees may not have their services terminated just because they are HIV positive.
As long as they are fit enough to carry out their duties they are entitled to remain in employment.
Only if they are in an advanced stage of illness which is affecting them severely may it be justified to board them on grounds of incapacity and at that stage they would be entitled to the normal agreed benefits.
Also staff may not refuse to work together with staff members who have disclosed their HIV positive status.
Space allows us to deal with only some of the issues involved.

Should I Go Alone or Should I Take My Sexual Partner with Me for an HIV Test?
Question: I am planning to have an HIV test.
Should I go alone or should I take my sexual partner with me.
If my partner accompanies me, will I have to reveal details of my sexual history in his presence.
Are there circumstances in which it might be advisable to go alone?
Answer: If your sexual partner agrees to accompany you and also agrees to be tested, this is usually the best scenario.
One of the major goals of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is the prevention of HIV infection through behaviour change.
Worldwide research has shown that when both partners are tested at the same time, the likelihood of maintaining an HIV negative status is greatly increased.
One of the reasons for this is that by testing together you are demonstrating to each other your commitment to each other's well-being.
Essentially you are bringing into the open the issue of trust and of being able to rely on each other not to jeopardize the health of the relationship.
This does not mean however, that the partners are counselled together.
On the contrary it is important that people be counselled separately before taking the test to enable a comprehensive assessment to be made of the unique risk factors applicable to each individual.
This discussion is kept totally confidential .
Results are also given individually to enable people who are found to be HIV positive to decide how best to handle this knowledge.
At ATICC people are given the opportunity, should they so wish, to discuss their results mutually in the presence of their counsellor(s).
This enables partners to explore future prevention strategies and other important issues such as trust.
Sometimes only one partner tests positive.
Such relationships are referred to as HIV- discordant.
In such cases additional tests might be necessary to ascertain whether the partner testing negative is in the period during which the infection cannot yet be detected (ie. the "window period").
On-going couple counselling is helpful during this time of uncertainty.
Clearly when both partners test positive, on-going couple counselling is also beneficial in assisting the them to come to terms with their situation.
There are a number of possible situations however, in which it might be advisable to come for VCT by yourself.
These usually arise from relationships in which there is a measure of mistrust, poor communication and/or potential for abuse or violence.
Of course there is also the situation where a relationship has just ended, but it should be remembered that it is necessary to wait for three months after the active sexual relationship has ended before presenting for a test.
Another one of the advantages of both partners presenting simultaneously is that if they have had a monogamous relationship with each other for a minimum of three months the "window period" problem falls away if they both test negative.
ATICC provides VCT as well as Couple Counselling by Psychologists experienced in the field of HIV/AIDS.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Will the Government's ARV Programme Work and Where Can I Get These Drugs?
How Will the Government's ARV Programme Work and Where Can I Get These Drugs?
Question: I have heard that government will be providing HIV positive people with antiretrovirals (ARV's) in the near future.
I would like to know about how the ARV programme will work so that I can also get these drugs.
Answer: You are right in saying that ARV's will be publicly available, however not all HIV positive people will need to be on ARV treatment.
ARV therapy helps people living with HIV to live a longer and healthier life by lowering the amount of virus in the body (viral load) thereby enabling the immune system to get strong again.
In South Africa about 5 million people have already been infected with the HI virus (1 in every 9 people) but only about 500 000 people need to take ARV's because the rest are still healthy.
The only time HIV positive people will need to go onto ARV's is if they have a CD4 count below 200 (CD4 count is the test that shows how strong the immune system is) or an AIDS defining illness (e.g. extreme weight loss, meningitis, pneumonia, dementia, extrapulmony TB, cancers, fungal and parasitic infections).
Therefore you would need to have met one of these two criteria before you would qualify for ARV therapy.
The Western Cape planned to have 19 sites for the ARV roll out by April 2004 and a further 14 sites starting later in the year, which gives a total of 33 sites where one could become part of the ARV programme.
The ARV programme will work as follows:
Clients will be referred to the programme when their CD4 counts are below 200 or if they are diagnosed with an AIDS defining illness.
Further criteria to be met include:
The client must be committed to taking ARV triple therapy (combination of 3 drugs taken) for life.
Disclosing to someone who will be a treatment "buddy' or assistant for the client to ensure adherence.
This is important, as having to take many drugs at the same time of day, every day of for the rest of your life is not easy to accomplish without help.
The client needs to be adherent to ensure that they have enough of the drug in their body to make sure they do not become drug resistant.
Making sure that the client does not abuse substances, especially alcohol.
The reason for this is to ensure that the person does not suffer from liver toxicity.
In addition to which it will be very difficult to be compliant to treatment when under the influence of a substance.
The client is also encouraged to follow a healthy lifestyle and is made aware of the dangers of drug interactions.
ensuring that the person will be able to attend 3 information sessions and 2 individual counselling sessions.
This process will take about 6 to 8 weeks to complete.
The purpose of this will be to educate the client on various things including, information on what ARVs are, how they work, the side effects, the importance of adherence and drug resistance.
The counsellors would also need to do a social and psychological assessment of the client in order for the medical team to decide if the client will qualify for ARV treatment.
If the client does qualify then ongoing counselling and clinic visits will be needed.
If the client does not yet qualify then the cousellor and the client will work together on the problem so that the client will be able to qualify.
The client has to agree to take responsibility for their own health and treatment.
This means taking ownership around pill taking, attending all sessions and ensuring that they comply with the conditions of the programme.
In conclusion, HIV positive people will be able to receive free ARV therapy when their immune system is weak and needs to be strengthened (CD4 below 200) and when they have been able to show that they are ready for a life-long commitment to the therapy.
Therefore you will need to go to your nearest clinic to be assessed as to whether you qualify for the programme.
Question: Hooray!!!
Answer: I'm glad to hear you are excited about the ARV's being made freely available.
It is difficult for me to say you will qualify to be on ARV's.
The best thing for you to do is to go to your nearest clinic or doctor and request that they refer you to an HIV clinic.
At the clinic they are going to take bloods from you to test your CD4 count, which helps the doctors to determine how strong your immune system is or how high your viral load is.
Remember, to qualify to be on ARV's you have to have a CD4 count of less than 200 or an AIDS defining illness.
Our immune system is like our body's army.
It's job is to keep us healthy by fighting any germs or diseases that attack us.
The immune system is made up of special cells called CD4 cells.
When a person has a strong immune system they have lots of CD4 cells.
If we want to know how strong a person's immune system is, we do a CD4 count.
To go back to how HIV attacks the immune system: When a person is infected with HIV, it takes over the CD4 cells.
The virus stops the CD4 cells from fighting off diseases and forces them to make more viruses instead.
After many years the person has a lot of virus in their blood and very few CD4 cells.
When the immune system is low opportunistic infections may set in such as TB, which will lower the immune system even more, but as you know TB can be treated even if a person is HIV positive.
A reminder, there is no cure for HIV.
Antiretroviral drugs are medication that could help you to live a longer and healthier life, by slowing down the effects of the virus on your body.
Act now so that you benefit from the available ARV program.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Do I Talk To My Children about HIV and AIDS?
How Do I Talk To My Children about HIV and AIDS?
Question: I have two children under the age of 10 years and they often ask questions about very complex issues.
Recently, their questions about HIV and AIDS have become challenging to answer and I feel like I am not always sure of what to say or how I should approach the topic.
I am aware however that they need to have some information.
What do I do?
Answer: Talking to children about difficult things could often leave parents wondering whether they have handled the questions adequately and appropriately.
HIV and AIDS are such complex issues to talk about because they present a challenge to all of us.
Also when we start talking about HIV and AIDS we realize that we might also have to talk about relating issues such as sex and sexuality.
Your sense is absolutely spot-on that children need to have information regarding HIV and AIDS.
Just as we would teach our children the rules of crossing the street in order to be safe and have a way of dealing with a potentially dangerous situation so we need to teach our children about other potentially risky situations.
We are trying to raise children in an environment where violence is common, HIV infection is growing, drugs are widely spread and easily available, and high-risk sexual activity is the norm.
This all means that if we are to address and talk about any of these issues, we need to firstly be encouraging open and effective communication.
This would consist of both answering questions as well as listening carefully even when the topic(s) of discussion is not easy to deal with.
Why is it important for parents to communicate with their children about HIV and AIDS?
* Children need to be able to protect themselves
* They should be equipped to take control over their bodies
* To be able to cope with their feelings regarding some of the issues that the topic might raise
* They also need to be prepared for challenges that might face them as teenagers or later as young adults
When children ask you questions it is because they trust that you are able to give them some information.
Sometimes they will also ask so as to confirm or verify other sources of information that might not necessarily be accurate!
Either way, it provides a good opportunity to start communicating about difficult things.
Here are some tips to help you get started:
* Don't Panic!
Your children will probably ask some things that you are not prepared for and that could make you feel awkward.
Panic, which could result in no response or a dismissal of the question, will not help.
Good information can help them stay safe and make wise decisions
* Encourage Talk - Be open to talking with your children about all sorts of things.
Chat, share, laugh, communicate!
* Start Young - The earlier you begin, the easier it is.
By the time your children are teenagers they will be prepared, and less likely to make unwise choices.
* Be Sensitive - Respect the stage and age that your children are at.
Don't give more information than they want or need. (E.g. a 6-year-old and a 9-year-old will have different questions and concerns).
If you are not sure ask for advice.
Don't carry on talking when they have stopped listening.
* Start Conversations - Create an environment of trust and communication.
Find ways to gently start talking about difficult things NOW!
* Talk Often - A once-in-a-lifetime sex talk will not give your children all the information they need.
Repeat yourself.
Make sure you have been understood.
Children need to hear things over and over again to learn.
* Be Honest - If you do not know an answer, say so.
But try and say it in a way that does not stop communication.
Perhaps you could suggest that the child talks to a relative or health worker.
Better still, offer to go together!
Try and learn with your children.
* Make sure that YOU are equipped!
You cannot always predict when a difficult topic is going to be raised.
You do however need to be clued up on the facts regarding HIV/AIDS and you need to feel comfortable talking about difficult things.

Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Is Counselling Necessary before Having an Aids Test?
Is Counselling Necessary before Having an Aids Test?
Question: I want to have an AIDS test but I'm told I have to be counselled before I can be tested.
Is this necessary?
Answer: The law doesn't allow HIV testing to take place unless you are fully informed beforehand.
The counselling is to provide you with adequate information so that you can decide whether you are ready for the test and its possible consequences.
This enables you to give what is known as "informed consent."
Pre-test counselling is also necessary to make sure that the timing of the test is right in order to make certain you receive a reliable result.
If a test is conducted too soon after risk behaviour has taken place, the test may not give an accurate result.
For example, if you had had unprotected sex within the previous thirteen weeks and were infected, with HIV on one of those occasions, testing now would be too soon to be sure of the test indicating that you have been infected.
This is known as "being in the Window Period."
The object of the test is to find out whether "antibodies" to HIV are present in the blood.
If the body has produced cells (known as antibodies) to fight the virus then this shows that the virus has entered the body.
However, it takes up to thirteen weeks from the infection date for these antibodies to be detectable and so it is necessary to wait for this period to elapse in order to make sure that the test result is reliable.
In order for you to determine when you have been at risk, you first of all need to know what are the various ways in which you could become infected and what are the relevant degrees of risk.
For example, some people think that 'dry' kissing is a risk, whereas it is not.
By explaining what is and what is not risk behaviour we enable you to judge when you were last at risk and what is your overall degree of risk.
In some cases it turns out that testing is probably not necessary.
In other cases testing should be delayed, e.g. if you are in the Window Period.
We also make use of the counselling session to provide information about effective preventative measures.
The tests themselves are very reliable.
However, it is essential that they are conducted at the right time, so a great deal depends on whether the information you provide about the timing and nature of your risk behaviour is accurate.
Holding back information can only undermine the reliability of the test.
If you are not in the Window Period and you test "Negative", the result is reliable and you are NOT infected with HIV.
If, however, your test shows that you have been infected with HIV, a second, confirmatory test will be conducted to eliminate any possible error, even though our experience to date is that the second test invariably confirms the first test.
Testing positive for the HIV does not necessarily mean that you have AIDS but it does mean that you can infect others.
Obviously, many issues will be raised by receiving a Positive result.
At ATICC we are able to offer up to six post-test sessions to support those who test positive and their partners.
These sessions are provided by registered psychologists with considerable experience in this field.
There is no charge and all counselling is conducted in the strictest confidence.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can My Children Contract HIV through Casual Means?
Can My Children Contract HIV through Casual Means?
Question: My husband recently tested HIV positive.
We have been seeing a counsellor but I am still nervous about some of the things I was told.
We were told that you can't get infected with HIV by sharing cups and spoons and towels, but I have three children aged 12, 10 and 7 and my nervousness stems from the fact that I worry that we might get it through casual means anyway.
Answer: To be able to prevent HIV infection it is important that one understands the modes of transmission of the virus in order to prevent getting infected.
Your counsellor was quite correct in saying that you cannot contract HIV from casual contact such as hugging, sharing food, sharing eating utensils, shaking hands, using the same toilet as someone with HIV, or by any other contact where blood is not transferred from the open wound of an infected person to the open wound of another person.
Insects such as mosquitoes also do not spread HIV from person to person.
There are four ways in which one can become infected with HIV.
1. Unprotected Sexual Intercourse.
Most people become infected through having unprotected sex (not using a condom).
2. Mother to Child Transmission
Women who are infected with HIV can pass the virus to their unborn babies during pregnancy, during labour and delivery, or through breast feeding.
3. Receiving Infected Blood into One's Bloodstream.
One could become infected if HIV infected blood comes into direct contact with that person's blood.
This could happen through an open sore, sharing razor blades or needles that were used by someone already infected with HIV, from receiving infected blood during a blood transfusion.
However, in South Africa all donated blood is tested for HIV before it is used in blood transfusions to ensure that the blood supply is as safe as possible.
How can HIV be prevented?
Parents should discuss sexuality with their children from an early age.
People, especially young people, should be encouraged not to have sex until they are ready and then they need to agree with their partners to be faithful to each other in a stable relationship.
Condoms should always be used during sexual contact outside of a stable, monogamous relationship.
When using skin piercing instruments such as razor blades, needles or syringes, these should be new or otherwise properly sterilised.
These instruments should not be shared with other people casually.
Recreational drug use lowers the immune system and makes the body more susceptible to infections.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Are the Chances of my Child Contracting HIV/AIDS at Play School?
What Are the Chances of my Child Contracting HIV/AIDS at Play School?
Question: My child, age five years, has recently started attending a local play school.
I have heard so much about HIV and AIDS, the latest being that more and more children are being infected.
What are the chances of my child contracting HIV/AIDS at play school?
Answer: Often HIV/AIDS is associated with and thought of as an adult concern and issue.
Over the past decade, children have however received attention with regard to HIV/AIDS, not only however as those seen as affected but also as those who at risk of infection.
To allay your fears, it is necessary to state that the highest risk of transmission of HIV in children is through vertical infection.
Other sources of HIV infection in children are through child sexual abuse and caring for those infected (this is usually the case in older children).
Increased research in the area of HIV/AIDS and children show that children who have been infected vertically often live to puberty and that these children have become more visible in certain settings.
What you could possibly have come across regarding the increase in the number of infected children is what is referred to as long-term progressors.
These are children who have been vertically infected, and have lived with the virus for many years before becoming ill and succumbing to the disease.
These are children infected with HIV who remain relatively healthy and who manage to live through childhood.
They therefore are able to do most things that "normal" children do, for example, going to school, having friends, playing games/sport, etc.
There are also those referred to as short-term progressors.
These are HIV positive children who also through vertical transmission have become infected, but because of severely compromised immune systems, become ill soon after birth.
Within the first year they have usually experienced many illnesses and often only live until approximately age 5.
During these few years, because of compromised health and functioning, they often require much more attention, and are often not as able to develop with the same freedom as other children of similar age.
Often it is unlikely that "slow-progressors" would be going to play school.
This said, it is important to state that while children engage in rough-and -tumble games sometimes, the likelihood of being infected at play school is very minimal.
HIV is transmitted via bodily fluids, mainly blood.
HIV can be passed on through:
* Unprotected sexual intercourse
* Intravenous drug use, using infected needles
* Vertical transmission (as discussed previously)
The above seem to be activities to which adults are exposed and or experience.
The main factor however is exposure to blood, as this bodily fluid is the most "concentrated" with HIV.
Children, while curious, might be concerned about their friend or someone who has hurt themselves and are bleeding, but are not that curious to handle blood.
The sight of blood is enough for children naturally to be cautious.
However, like we teach our children other important things, like their address, telephone numbers, how to cross the street, so as to be safe, we should also teach our children how to protect themselves in terms of HIV.
Of course, this like all complex things we teach our children needs to be age-specific.
It would therefore at "play school" age be useful to teach children what to do when there is exposure to blood.
What is useful and in many schools this is what is being taught, is the following:
* Do not touch the blood
* Call a teacher or another adult immediately
* Try to remain calm and not to crowd the injured person
It is ironic however that it is the infected child, rather than the uninfected child who is more at risk of becoming ill from shared contact.
Playschools are often places where there are numerous bugs afloat.
The infected child's compromised immunity places him/her in a vulnerable position to become very ill from picking up a bug that the uninfected child's immune system would be able to fight with relative ease.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can I Breastfeed my Baby if I'm HIV Positive?
Can I Breastfeed my Baby if I'm HIV Positive?
Question: I am pregnant and HIV positive.
Is is okay for me to breastfeed my baby?
I have been counselled at the MOU and heard about the MTCT program, but I'm still confused.
Answer: It is understandable that you feel worried about breastfeeding your baby as you are HIV positive.
It is important that you focus on what is best for your baby and to ensure that the chances of your baby being infected are limited.
Sharing the fact of your HIV status with others is your choice entirely.
As you were informed by the Counsellor at the MOU concerning the Mother to Child Transmission Programme, it is important that you consider all the feeding options and choose what is best suited to your baby, according to your circumstances.
I don't know how much you remember from your first counselling session, but you need to choose to either exclusively breastfeed or to formula feed your baby.
Exclusive breastfeeding means only breastmilk and nothing else but breastmilk (except perhaps for prescribed medicine from the clinic).
No water, formula, juices, gripe water or even a dummy.
All these things together with breastmilk constitutes MIXED FEEDING and this can be harmful to the baby
Once you have changed from breastfeeding to formula feeding, you should NEVER put the baby back onto the breast.
This would be mixed feeding and could cause the baby to become HIV positive.
The important thing about breast milk is the first milk the mother produces, called Colostrum.
This lines the baby's stomach and gut, and this protects the baby from infections.
Breast milk also contains all the nutrients the baby needs.
It is always at the right temperature, is easily available (the more you breastfeed the more milk you produce), and it also saves time.
You need to remember the basic hygiene principles of cleaning your nipples before you breastfeed to prevent infections.
You have to make sure that baby latches correctly onto the nipple so that you can avoid having cracked nipples, which apart from being painful, could expose the baby to HIV infection.
If you develop a cracked nipple stop feeding from that breast.
Rather use the other breast and seek medical treatment immediately.
For all advice, please contact your MOU or baby clinic immediately.
As far as the baby is concerned, should the baby have an infection (oral thrush, gastro-enteritis etc), you need to take baby to the clinic immediately since the baby is at risk of becoming infected with HIV.
From six months of age the baby can be started on certain solid foods as advised by the clinic.
This brings me to the second feeding option, Formula Feeding.
If you choose to formula feed your baby, then he/she needs to be exclusively formula fed for 6 months.
You will need to connect with your MOU so that it can be arranged for you to leave the MOU after delivery with sufficient formula to last until your first visit to the baby clinic.
At the baby clinic you will be supplied regularly with formula for six month.
The most important thing to remember about formula is to prepare it exactly as instructed according to the weight and age of your baby.
Any deviation could cause your baby to become ill.
If you formula-feed your baby, the recommended way to do this is by cup feeding.
At the clinic you will be shown how this is done.
Thoroughly cleaning the cup and spoon you use is absolutely necessary in order to prevent infections to the baby.
You will need to decide which option is best for you.
The risk of HIV transmission will be lessened if you exclusively breastfeed your baby for not longer than four months.
Formula feeding means the baby will not be at risk of getting infected with HIV, but could be at risk for other infections like gastro enteritis, pneumonia, etc.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Is it Possible To Become Infected with HIV through Oral Sex?
Is it Possible To Become Infected with HIV through Oral Sex?
Question: Is it possible to become infected with HIV through Oral Sex?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to become infected with HIV through Oral Sex.
In terms of risk, as far as it is known, there has been no research conducted to establish exactly what the rate of transmission is, through oral sex.
Some opinions are that oral sex is Low to Medium Risk, while other opinions have rated it as Medium to High Risk.
It should be remembered that it is by being exposed to the high risk body fluids of a person infected with HIV and by getting these body fluids into one's bloodstream, that one could become infected with HIV also.
The mucus membrane starts at the mouth and lines all our internal organs.
Infection can occur when there is injury to the mucus membrane.
If the mucus membrane lining is intact i.e., undamaged, HIV cannot be transmitted.
This lining is very delicate and can be easily injured.
A practical example of how fragile this mucus membrane is: If one were to take a mouthful of hot coffee, the mucus membrane in the mouth would be scalded, become tender and inflamed.
This injury could be a place of entry for HIV into the bloodstream, if the person were to engage in unprotected oral sex with an HIV infected partner.
It is a known fact that at least 68% of people in any given population has oral disease of one kind or another.
Oral disease, such as decayed teeth, mouth ulcers, gingivitis etc causes injury to the mucus membrane in the mouth.
Therefore, anyone who has damage to the lining within their mouths could be at risk of contracting HIV infection, were they to be exposed to the high risk body fluids of an infected person during oral sex.
For the purpose of oral sex, the high risk fluids are: Blood, Semen and Vaginal fluids.
BLOOD: Due to the fact that some of the injuries to one's genitals are often unseen with the naked eye (tiny cuts or hidden sores) one cannot always tell whether the genitals of one's sexual partner is healthy.
Therefore one could be taking small amounts of blood into one's mouth without realising it.
If one's partner has a sexually transmitted infection on the genitals where there is either a discharge or a sore, one would be exposed to blood, pus etc, which could contain HIV.
Other Sexually Transmitted Infections could also be transmitted to the mouth in this way e.g. Blisters (Herpes) or Syphillis or Warts.
Fever blisters on the mouth could also be transmitted to the partner's genitals during unprotected oral sex.
SEMEN: Since HIV is found in the semen of an HIV infected man, if he were to ejaculate into his partner's mouth, the HIV contained in the ejaculatory semen could infect the partner.
From our counselling we have concluded that the number of people who practise oral sex is increasing.

Can One Prevent Infection with HIV through Oral Sex?
Question: Can one prevent infection with HIV through oral sex?
Answer: Yes.
If one were to practise oral sex, it would be important to ensure that:
1. a condom is used for every episode of oral sex;
2. at no time during oral sex on a man should ejaculation take place into the partner's mouth.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Is Antiretroviral Therapy?
What Is Antiretroviral Therapy?
Question: What is antiretroviral therapy?
How does it work?
Answer: Currently there is no cure for AIDS.
However, there are drugs that can slow down the progress of HIV and thus slow down the damage to your immune system.
These drugs are called antiretrovirals (ARV's).
ARV's slow down the reproduction rate of HIV.
Once the virus is reproducing at a slower rate, it is less able to harm your immune system.
If your immune system is functioning properly, your body is less likely to become sick.
Your immune system is your body's defense system against infection.
Since ARV's slow down the damage to your immune system, if they are used properly, they allow you to live a longer, healthier life.
The goals for ARV treatment are:
1. to ensure maximum and lasting control of the amount HIV in your body;
2. to restore and protect the immune functioning of the body by allowing the CD4 cells to replenish their numbers;
3. to reduce HIV-related illnesses and deaths and
4. in the long run to improve the quality of life for people living with AIDS.
In order to understand how ARV's work we need to know about the lifecycle of the HI Virus.
HIV infects cells of the immune system and turns the cells into virus factories: one virus can create millions more of itself, using our own cells for this purpose.
The cells that HIV targets are called CD4 cells, which form an important part of the immune system.
Once HIV enters these cells it goes through several steps before new HI viruses are produced.
Each type of ARV works at a different step of the HIV lifecycle.
You medical doctor or health care worker can explain to you in more detail how this works.
In order for ARV treatment to be effective for a long time there is a need to take more than one ARV at a time.
This is known as combination therapy and refers to the use of a combination of ARV drugs in treating HIV infection.
For ARV's to be effective, they need to be taken strictly according to your medical doctor's instructions.
ARV's can cause side effects such as diarrhoea, tiredness and headaches etc., even if they are taken correctly.
This does not mean that the drugs are not working.
If you happen to experience some of these side effects, you will need to discuss it with your doctor who will help to manage the side-effects.
Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your treatment.
You will not start ARV treatment immediately once you have been diagnosed HIV positive.
ARV treatment will start once your CD4 count is below 200 and/or once you have an AIDS defining illness.
In addition you will need to receive special counselling to prepare you for the ARV treatment before you start taking the drugs.
ARV's will not get the HI virus out of your body.
However, the benefits of taking ARV's include the fact that the functioning of your immune system will be restored and protected; the production of the virus will be able to be controlled; your health will improve and ultimately your life will be prolonged.
ARV treatment is a complex process and it is advised that you discuss all your options with your doctor and counsellor who will be able to help you and support you during your treatment.
Unlike most medications ARV's need to be taken strictly as prescribed, under medical supervision, for the rest of your life.
Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Why Do Black Women in South Africa Seem To Be More Vulnerable To HIV Infection Than Anyone Else?
Why Do Black Women in South Africa Seem To Be More Vulnerable To HIV Infection Than Anyone Else?
Question: Why do black women in South Africa seem to be more vulnerable to HIV infection than anyone else?
Answer: Statistics show that black people have a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.
Sub - Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence in the world.
People most infected and at risk are those within the economically active population.
It would also seem that black women between the ages of 15-49 years who are of child bearing age, are at the highest risk of infection.
This poses the question as to why it is that black people are the most affected and as the statistics show, the most infected of all population groups?
The history of unequal distribution of wealth in South Africa, during the times of apartheid which deprived black people of basic human rights i.e.. education, housing, jobs and access to health, may be associated with the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
The socio-economic status of black people makes them vulnerable to infections like TB, sexually transmitted infections (STI's), and HIV/AIDS.
Especially vulnerable are those who live in informal settlements as they are most likely to be poor and unemployed.
They live in conditions characterised by poor infrastructure, i.e.. with no sanitation, no clean running water, or electricity in place.
Overcrowding and in some areas, no ventilation promotes disease.
Within the black communities the status of women is low, which makes them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, as they often feel the loss of power to negotiate safer sex (the use of condoms) with their partners, due to a strong cultural belief that a man is the initiator around sexual matters.
Furthermore, their financial dependency on their partners makes them vulnerable.
Women living in rural areas and those working on the farms are even more vulnerable to sexually transmissible infections including HIV/AIDS, as access to health care facilities is difficult because services are minimal.
In some situations such resources are non-existent.
Added to these circumstances, women are deprived of finances.
In other situations the fear of stigma may result in women not disclosing the fact that they are HIV positive.
In addition, biological factors increase a woman's vulnerability due to undetected STI's and the fact that sexual fluid remains within her body for two or three days and can enter the blood stream if there are any lesions due to STI's or forceful intercourse.
Movement of people seeking a better life, from one area to another, (migrant labour) makes them vulnerable to HIV as they are away from their families for long periods of time.
In the case of men who, through their working situations, stay away from their wives/ families for prolonged periods of time, they may start other relationships where they often fail to practice safer sex.
This further exposes both men and women to HIV/AIDS.

Can One Get Infected with HIV From Social Contact?
Question: Can one get infected with HIV from hugging a person with HIV/AIDS, sharing eating utensils, sharing bath towels, using public toilets, a dog bite, a mosquito bite or working with a person with HIV/AIDS?
Answer: No.
Any social contact with an HIV infected person holds no risk of infection with HIV/AIDS for uninfected persons.
Although HIV has been identified in body fluids eg: saliva and urine, no scientific evidence exists to show that these fluids cause transmission of HIV.
There is no known risk of transmission from sweat, tears, respiratory droplets, swimming pool water, communal bath water, food or drinking water.
Data has been collected from over 16 000 people with HIV/AIDS over 4 years with family members and health care workers who cared for them.
To date, none have been infected with HIV from this daily social contact.
It usually requires unprotected, penetrative sexual contact or broken skin for this to happen.
Intact skin remains the best defense against the virus.
Casual contact:
HIV is not spread by casual contact
HIV cannot live in the air, water or food
HIV is weak - it only lives in body fluids
HIV only spreads if the body fluid of a person with HIV gets into the blood stream of another person
This is why shaking hands with people with HIV does not spread the virus.
If this was not true many more people would have HIV.
Doctors, nurses, teachers, classmates, co-workers, friends and family all touch people with HIV and do not get the virus unless they have unprotected sex or share needles with them.
People with HIV can cook food for others without any risk of passing the infection.
The virus is not spread by doorknobs, typewriters, telephones or anything else that can be touched by someone with HIV or eating food prepared by someone with HIV.
No one has ever been infected by sharing cigarettes, being sneezed on or spat on by someone with HIV.
Measles and chicken pox is spread through the air but HIV is not air or vector borne (carried by insects such as mosquitoes or fleas).
Colds or flu can be serious for someone with HIV/AIDS.
Never allow anyone with chicken pox or measles to enter the room where one living with HIV/AIDS is being nursed when ill .
HIV and Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Alcohol or drug abuse influences one's decision making ability and makes it more likely that a person will not think clearly and will be more likely to do things that put them at risk of getting HIV, such as sharing needles or practicing unprotected sex.

What Evidence Is there that Good Nutrition Consistently Improves The Immune Response?
Question: I wish to enquire about the diet "prescribed or recommended" by the health minister which has made media headlines recently.
I am confused by the conflicting reports about the effects and the lasting benefits of this diet on people living with HIV and AIDS that have been circulated.
We have been told through the media that this should be our "informed choice" of treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS, as opposed to antiretrovirals.
What evidence is there that any of these foods consistently improve the immune response?
Were human studies carried out?
How effective is a diet of blended or grated lemon, mixed with extra virgin olive oil and water, crushed garlic and ginger, spinach, beetroot and vitamin supplements?
Answer: Where human studies have been carried out, the results around dietary programmes as medicinal alternatives are still contradictory and inconclusive.Â¹ The scientific community advocates good nutrition and ARVs.
What does the literature say about these foods?
Fresh garlic has excellent anti-fungal, antiviral and anti-bacterial properties; it also purportedly balances blood pressure and lowers cholesterol.
Although some literature states that garlic is safe if taken in large quantities.Â²
Scientific sources advise that garlic powder can damage the gastric mucosa and that garlic supplements, taken for over 2 months, may lengthen bleeding time (interfere with clotting) and interact with ARVs.Â³
Like garlic, onions also help to fight infection.
In one study however, onions and olive oil also failed to show any improvement to the immune system of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHAs), and in fact seemed hasten the onset to AIDS.
The literature states that large amounts of ingested onions may cause chronic diarrhoea and intestinal distension.Â³ Onions as well as the African Potato previously advocated for, appear to have been omitted from the diet listed in your question.
The African Potato (Hypoxis) had mixed success.
Initial studies undertaken showed promising results with PLWHAs not progressing to AIDS.
In a study on the safety and efficacy of Hypoxis, the majority of patients developed serious bone marrow suppression and the study had to be stopped after 8 weeks. Â³
Drinking lemon juice (2Tsp) and olive oil (1Tsp) mixed with water, once a day, reportedly increases appetite and energy levels and reduces swollen lymph glands. Â²
Most sources recommend a good multivitamin especially if you cannot eat enough food for your body's needs, due to nausea or diarrhoea.
A balanced diet - fruit and vegetables (including beetroot, spinach and ginger), nuts and seeds, grains, seafoods, meat, poultry and dairy products - is still the best source of vitamins and minerals, however.
Please ensure that meat and fish are thoroughly cooked before being eaten by PLWHAs.
Most foods have beneficial properties, but immune-boosting foodstuffs, vitamins and supplements, if taken in large quantities, may have an adverse effect even in a completely healthy person.
The immune system of a person with HIV is running amok, and the effects may be even more unexpected.
Some nutrients boost the immune system as well as enhance the replication of HIV in the body.
Supplements can also interfere with ARVs and it is absolutely imperative to inform your health care team of any medication, herbal medicines, homeopathic remedies, or other substances you are taking.
While the CD4 cell count is only an indication of the body's immune system, the report of the CD4 cell counts improving in 2 subjects on the above diet may have given a false impression.
The CD4 cell count may fluctuate by up to 80 points on either side of the count due to influences like the time of day, the previous meal, an infection or a mood shift.
In both of the subjects the new CD4 cell count had improved by less than 80 points.
It is perhaps best to exercise caution, and try to find the most balanced way, and one that suits your needs, to deal with this disease.
It is important to ensure that all food prepared for PLWHAs is hygienically handled to prevent infections.

Application for a permit to import animal vaccines into South Africa
Vaccines for use in animals may be imported and distributed or sold in South Africa only once they have been registered in terms of the Fertilizers, Farms Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 1947 .
To import a registered vaccine for use in animals, you must obtain an import permit from the Directorate Animal Health.
This import permit is valid for a limited period and for one consignment only.
If you want to import an unregistered vaccine for a trial in South Africa, you need two permits.
One permit is from the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 and the other from the Directorate Animal Health.
The application for the permit from the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 must be accompanied by the complete proposed trial protocol.
The Directorate Animal Health issues an import permit only once they receive a copy of the permit issued by the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947.
A vaccine imported for a trial may not be sold.
In an emergency situation where an outbreak of a disease occurs and no registered vaccine is available in the country, it may be a necessary to use an unregistered vaccine.
Then you, as a prospective importer, must apply to the Medicines Control Council for a Section 21 exemption in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act .
You also need, from the Directorate Animal Health, an import permit for the vaccine to enter the country.
They issue this import permit only once you have obtained approval from the Medicines Control Council and submitted proof to them.
In this case, the unregistered vaccine may be sold for a limited period until registration has been obtained.
If the vaccine is not registered and is to be used in a trial, send a signed covering letter on your company letterhead paper to the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 requesting an import permit.
Your letter must have details on the following:
quantities
name of the product

Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child
Every child has the right to basic necessities such as:
1. food
2. shelter
3. clothing
4. medical care
5. schooling
Children should get these basic needs from their parents or relatives.
Parents or relatives maintain children directly, when the child lives with them.
Parents or relatives maintain children indirectly, when the child lives with someone else, by paying maintenance, or money to support the child and provide his or her basic needs.
CONTENTS: You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child
Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Who Has a Duty to Maintain?
Who Has a Duty to Maintain?
The law requires a child to be supported or maintained by:
1. his or her parents, whether married, living together, separated or divorced, including parents who have adopted the child; and
2. his or her grandparents, if the child's parents were married to each other.
3. This legal duty is called "the duty to maintain" or "the duty to support".
Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What Is the Maintenance System?
What Is the Maintenance System?
Where parents separate, many parents voluntary pay maintenance to the parent living with the child.
Other parents fail to honour their legal duty to maintain their child.
The maintenance system is the system of courts which ensures that parents honour their duty to maintain their children.
A maintenance court can order a parent who does not live with his or her child to pay maintenance for the support of his or her child.
The maintenance system therefore ensures that parents not living with their children make a fair financial contribution towards the support of their children.
Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Must I Still Pay Maintenance if ... ?
Must I Still Pay Maintenance if ... ?
Must I still pay maintenance if the other parent:
* remarries?
* is involved in another relationship?
* does not let me see the children?
Your children's right to their basic needs has nothing to do with your view of the other parent's behaviour.
Your children still need maintenance, and you must still pay maintenance, even if the other parent remarries or gets involved in another relationship.
Again, your children are still entitled to maintenance even if you cannot see them.

How Is the Amount of Maintenance Calculated?
The maintenance court or the maintenance officer at court will help in working out how much money should be paid as maintenance.
Usually, the court first works out how much the children need for their maintenance (ie., to provide them with food, shelter, clothes, and so on).
The court will then see that each parent makes a fair contribution to those needs, usually by requiring them to contribute in proportion to their respective incomes.

Return for payment of provisional tax â first payment
Where an individual earns taxable income that is not subject to SITE or PAYE deductions , he or she has to pay provisional tax on this income.
Provisional tax payments are made on a six-monthly basis.
Provisional tax is intended to help taxpayers meet their tax liabilities on an on-going basis as opposed to paying a big amount once a year on assessment.
The provisional tax paid will be offset against the final tax liability that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assessment.
A person who becomes liable for the payment of provisional tax must, within 30 days of becoming liable, apply in writing for registration at the local branch office of the South African Revenue Service .
Failure to do so will result in interest and penalties being levied on late payments and additional tax for the late submission of returns.
The due date for the payment of provisional tax for the first period is within six months from the start of the year of assessment.
The first provisional tax payment must represent half of the tax liability for the full tax year.
Calculate provisional tax as follows for the first period:
half of the total tax for the full year
less the employees tax deducted for this period
less any allowable foreign tax credits for this period .
Make payments on the prescribed IRP6 return's payment advice, on or before the due dates for payment.
SARS will send registered provisional taxpayers the appropriate forms.
The following methods to effect payments to SARS are available:
provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidays
where payments are made by mail, via the bank or ATM, sufficient time for mailing or processing must be taken into account
where payments are done electronically, provision must be made for your bank's cut-off times and for a clearance period that could take between two and five days.
Banking details:
Clients paying over the counter at any ABSA, FNB, or Nedbank branch will no longer need to supply a bank account number and bank code when making payments.
This applies equally to all ABSA, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank internet banking clients.
All that will be required is:
the client's 19-digit payment reference number; and
the beneficiary ID / account number which is linked to a specific type of tax to make payments.
These details are reflected on the payment advice of the IRP 6 return.
Payments that do not comply with both the above-mentioned payment reference number and the beneficiary ID will not be accepted.
If the last day for payment falls on a public holiday or weekend, the payment must be made on the last working day prior to the public holiday or weekend.
For more details refer to the SARS website www.sars.gov.za
If the first provisional tax payment is based on an estimated taxable income that is less than the basic amount, a request and motivation should be included.
The IRP 6 return for the first period now includes a space where you must motivate such a request.
If SARS is not satisfied, a revised estimate may be requested.
To avoid penalties and interest, make sure that IRP 6 returns are submitted to the relevant SARS branch office well before the due date for payment.
This will ensure that your request is received and processed in time.
The payment advice portion of the IRP 6 return is now on a separate page.
Your return can therefore be submitted separately from your payment.
Consult the IRP 12 Guidelines if you require assistance in the completion of your IRP 6 return.
Income Tax Act, 1962 â Fourth Schedule
When you submit your returns SARS aims to:
process and assess 80% of correctly completed and signed income tax returns within 90 working days from date of receipt during peak periods and within 34 working days of receipt in off-peak periods
process VAT and PAYE returns within 20 working days of receipt
process 90% of all electronically submitted export and import returns within 4 hours of receipt and within 24 hours of receipt of manual submissions.
Note: If a representative is dealing with your tax affairs, ensure that SARS is informed of the fact.
This is to protect you and to ensure that SARS does not compromise your privacy and confidentiality.
Return for the first provisional tax payment Individual
Return for the first provisional tax payment Trust
Return for the first provisional tax payment Company or close corporation
SARS will send the forms to registered provisional taxpayers.
The payment advice is in each case attached to the IRP 6 return.
Return for the second provisional tax payment
A person who becomes liable for the payment of provisional tax must, within 30 days of becoming liable, apply in writing for registration at the local branch office of the South African Receiver of Revenue .
The due date for payment of the second provisional tax period is not later than the last day of the year of assessment or approved financial year-end date.
Note:
Where a February financial year-end creates financial hardship and approval has been obtained from SARS to submit financial statements to a date other than the end of February, such persons may also request approval to submit provisional tax returns in line with the approved financial year-end.
All other income however remains in the year of assessment ending 28/29 February.
Calculate provisional tax as follows as follows for the second period:
the total estimated tax for the full year
less the employees tax paid for the full year
less the any allowable foreign tax credits for the full year
less the amount paid for the first period.
the beneficiary ID / account number which is linked to a specific type of tax to make payments
these details are reflected on the payment advice of the IRP 6 return
payments that do not comply with both the above-mentioned payment reference number and the beneficiary ID will not be accepted.
IRP 6 returns for second period must be submitted even if, according to your calculation, no provisional tax is payable.
The second provisional tax payment should be based on an estimated taxable income which is equal to the basic amount or an amount based on your actual taxable income for that year.
This will ensure that your request is received and processed in time and you will not have to pay penalties and interest.
The payment advice portion of the IRP6 return is now on a separate page.
You can therefore submit your return separately from your payment.
Consult the IRP 12 Guidelines if you require assistance in the completion of your IRP6 return.
Income Tax Act, 1962 â Fourth Schedule
If a representative is dealing with your tax affairs, it is vital that you ensure that SARS is informed thereof.
Return for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: Individual
Return for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: Trust
Return for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: Company or close corporation
The payment advice is attached to the IRP 6 return.
ï»¿People's Housing Process Description
The process allows beneficiaries to establish a housing support organisation that will provide them with organisational, technical and administrative assistance.
The assistance includes training and guidance to the beneficiaries to build their own homes.
This option is available on a project basis to beneficiaries, via consolidation, institutional and project-linked subsidies.
In addition, it is available in rural areas where people only have functional tenure rights to the land that they occupy.
How does the People's Housing Process work?
The process allows you to use a subsidy to build your own house.
Since technical assistance and support in this process are critical, everyone participating in the process needs to have a support organisation.
This organisation provides the technical support to ensure that the house is built properly.
People who build their own houses themselves or who organise the building of their houses can build bigger houses for less money.
The People's Housing Process allows you to:
save on labour costs by doing some of the building work yourself or by getting assistance from your family, neighbours, friends and others to help you
avoid having to pay a profit element to developers, and
optimise your decisions.
To qualify for this process, you must:
Be a lawful resident in South Africa
Have a gross monthly household income of less than R3 500
Not have received a subsidy from the Government to buy a house previously.
BeÂ a first-time property owner.
Note that you have to enter into a contract with a support organisation which is a legal entity.
The support organisation will provide you with technical and administrative assistance.
contact the Provincial Department of Housing
supply identity documents of yourself, spouse and children
supply a copy of your salary advice or proof of earnings.
The applications are processed by the Provincial Departments of Housing.
The time frame to deliver this service varies from one case to the next.
There is no application form.

Government has a preferential procurement policy.
This means government takes into account factors other than price when awarding a tender.
These factors are calculated according to a points formula.
If you want to take advantage of preferential points, you must fill in the relevant forms.
The National Preferential Procurement Policy Act sets out the general framework to be followed in creating a preferential policy.
In the Western Cape, Provincial government bodies who have not developed a preferential procurement policy specific to their department, follow the Western Cape Preferential Procurement Policy.
The Public Financial Management Act sets out the other general rules which government must follow in issuing tenders, and should be read in conjunction with the regulations.
NATIONAL
At national level, preferential factors include:
* local manufacture of goods
* equity ownership by previously disadvantaged individuals
* equity ownership by women.
PROVINCIAL
The points formula used is described in WCBD 6.1, which must be completed. (See how tenders are awarded.)
For tenders under R500 000, an "80/20" points system is used. (That means that tenders are evaluated 80% on price and 20% on points for factors such as historically disadvantaged individual status, ownership by women, etc.) For tenders over R500 000, a "90/10" system is used.
Not all the preferential factors will apply for every tender.
The tender documents should indicate which preferential factors apply to your tender.
These factors, and their "WCBD" forms, are:
* Equity ownership by historically disadvantaged individuals, women and the disabled: WCBD 6.1 (all bids) or WCBD 6.2 (sales and letting of assets).
* Small business: WCBD 6.3
* Active involvement in community: WCBD 6.7
* Locally manufactured products: WCBD 6.4
* Use of measures to standardise skills of your workers: WCBD 6.5
* Development of human resources of your staff: WCBD 6.6
* Enterprise is located in the Western Cape, for work in the that province: WCBD 6.9
* Enterprises located in a region for work to be done in that region: WCBD 6.10
* Enterprises located in a municipality for work to be done in that municipality: WCBD 6.11
Recently Introduced Factors:
* Export-oriented production to create jobs: WCBD 6.8
* Enterprises located in rural areas: WCBD 6.12
