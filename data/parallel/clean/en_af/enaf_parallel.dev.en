What is a school governing body (SGB)?
An SGB is a structure that governs the school.
It stands in a position of trust towards the school.
It is made up of the principal, elected representatives of educators, non-educator staff, parents and learners, in the case of secondary schools.
The SGB can also select persons in the community who have special skills to be non-voting members of the SGB.
How do I get elected to represent other parents on the governing body?
You can represent other parents on a governing body if you are nominated and voted for by parents.
The SGB is elected for a three-year period.
You can stand at the next election.
As soon as your last child leaves the school, you must resign your seat, as you no longer have any rights on the SGB.
Parents can be re-elected as long as they have children in the school.
How do I get to know about the election process?
The principal/SGB of the school is required by law to provide all parents with information about the election of parents onto the governing body.
You should vote in each SGB election.
What happens if I'm not elected onto the school governing body?
Even if you are not elected onto the school governing body, you should support the school's SGB in its work and you must respond to written notices calling for a response.
You have the RIGHT to be involved in the affairs of the school through attending meetings of parents or other meetings organised by the school, including the SGB's Annual General Meeting.
The school must give you at least 30 days notice before this meeting is to be held.
At this meeting the SGB must present its budget and annual financial report.
The school must present a report concerning its activities at least once a year.
You also have the RIGHT to be consulted by the educators or the principal about the schooling activities of our child.
The principal and the educators at the school must notify you in good time and regularly about the well-being, behaviour, attendance and learning progress of you child.
You must also be informed and represent your child at any disciplinary proceedings against your child in terms of the school's Code of Conduct.
Who makes the decision about school matters?
The Head of the Provincial Education Department, through the principal, takes all decisions about education in the school.
You should be informed about these decisions and have the right to information concerning the school and your child's education.
Your school must also have a Code of Conduct.
You have the right to be consulted regarding the preparation and amendment of the Code of Conduct.
Where can I lodge an objection against a decision or action?
You can lodge an objection against a decision or action of:
* an educator, with the principal;
* a principal, with the Head of the Education Department in the province;
* a representative council of learners member, with the school governing body; and,

Language of Learning and Teaching
* What does the Language-in-Education Policy say?
* Will my child not be disadvantaged by being taught in a language other than English?
* Who decides on the language of learning and teaching?
* Does my child have options regarding the language of learning and teaching in a school?
What does the Language-in-Education Policy say?
The Department's Language-in-Education Policy encourages learners to learn more that one language.
It also encourages them to use the language that they best understand as the language of learning and teaching.
They can learn other languages as subjects or add other languages as languages of instruction.
Will my child not be disadvantaged by being taught in a language other than English?
Learning through the home language during the first years of formal schooling ensures a solid foundation for future learning, as well as the acquisition of new/other languages.
Who decides on the language of learning and teaching?
The SGB must decide on the language of learning and teaching used in a school.
The language used will depend on the preference of the majority of learners in the school and the ability of the school to teach in the preferred language.
In addition, the SGB needs to indicate how it will promote multilingualism in the school.
Does my child have options regarding the language of learning and teaching in a school?
Each learner must, upon registration at a school, indicate the preferred language of learning and teaching.
Any of our 11 languages may be indicated as the language of learning and teaching in a public school.
Where there are more than 30 children requesting a particular language, the school must make an effort to offer tuition in that language.

* Code of Conduct
* Corporal Punishment and Alternative Punishments
* Suspension & Expulsion
CODE OF CONDUCT
The governing body at each school must consult with educators, parents and learners to draft a code of conduct for learners.
This code of conduct must include:
* the types of misbehaviour that will be punished.
* the types of punishment that will be given for different forms of misbehaviour.
* procedure that the school will follow in disciplining a learner.
* grievance procedures for parents and learners if they want to take up a matter against another learner or the school.
A guide on how to establish a code of conduct is contained in the document Alternatives to Corporal Punishment
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND ALTERNATIVE PUNISHMENTS
Corporal punishment, e.g. caning, is prohibited in schools, and anyone found using it can be charged with assault.
To assist teachers find alternative means of disciplining children, the national Department of Education has released a document on alternative means of disciplining learners.
Parents who become aware of corporal punishment in a school should approach the principal and thereafter the school's Circuit Manager, who can be contacted via the nearest EMDC.
Learners who want to report corporal punishment anonymously can contact the Safe Schools Call Centre toll-free on 0800 45 46 47.
SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT
The regulations governing cases of serious misconduct are set out in Provincial Gazette Extraordinary 5190 of 31 October 1997.
These regulations specify the kinds of misconduct defined as serious (e.g. possession or use of liquor or drugs, assault, theft, immorality, absenteeism and disgraceful conduct).
A list of forms of serious misconduct is given in the Department of Education document Alternatives to Corporal Punishment .
A governing body can suspend a learner from school for up to a week for serious misconduct.
If the governing body finds the offence serious enough, it can recommend to the provincial Head of Education that he or she should expel the learner.
The Head of Education must decide on the matter within 14 days, during which time the learner may not attend school.
If a learner is expelled, he or she (and/or parents) can appeal to the provincial Minister of Education.
If an expelled learner is of compulsory school-going age, the Head of Education has to make arrangements to place him or her in another public school.

Questions and Answers about Measles & Polio Immunisation
This publication provides information for parents around measles and polio vaccinations.
Stop Polio!
Stop Measles!
Immunise!
MEASLES
What is Measles?
Measles is the most dangerous of all childhood diseases.
The first sign is a high fever followed by a blotchy red rash all over the body.
It is also accompanied by cough, a runny nose and red eyes.
Measles can cause dangerous complications, such as infection of the lungs, blindness and death.
What causes measles?
Measles is caused by a very small germ called the measles virus.
It cannot by seen with the naked eye.
It is spread when a child with measles coughs or sneezes.
Children who suffered from measles cannot get it a second time.
Most children who have been immunised against measles at the right age will not get measles.
Why is measles a dangerous disease?
Young children, who survive measles are weakened by the disease and may later die from malnutrition or other illnesses.
Measles is also an important cause of mental retardation and blindness.
A quarter of all deaths from measles occur before the age of one year.
Measles in older children usually occur as outbreaks, when large groups of children get measles at the same time.
The risk of a measles outbreak is higher when groups of children gather together for example in crèches day care centres and at schools.
Is it important to immunise children during the measles campaign?
Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the EXTRA measles injection during the campaign.
Children who miss the immunisation campaign might not be fully protected against the measles virus.
I heard that the parents or guardians of children must sign a consent form before a child can receive the extra measles immunisation.
Is it true?
If a child is to be immunised at a school or crèche where the parent is not present when the immunisation is given, a consent form will be given to parents or guardians of children in crèches, day care centres and at schools in advance.
It provides and opportunity to inform parents or guardians about the extra measles injection.
In this case, if you agree to this immunisation, please complete and sign the form and send it back to the school or crèche.
Your child will then receive the immunisation if consent forms are signed and returned on time!
If you bring the child to an immunisation centre during the campaign, it is not necessary for you to fill in a consent form.
POLIO
What is Polio?
Polio is a crippling disease.
It is caused by a very small germ called the polio virus.
Polio can lead to permanent lameness, deformity and even death.
Due to routine immunisations in childhood, polio has not been seen in South Africa since 1989.
However, there have been outbreaks of polio in neighbouring countries.
How will I recognize polio in a child?
Polio can be suspected when there is sudden weakness of the leg or arm or both or other parts of the body.
This weakness should not have been present at birth.
If the person was injured just before the weakness of the person has a history of being mentally retarded, then polio is not likely to be the cause of the weakness.
Please report any sudden weakness/paralysis in a child under 15 years (not caused by injury), to the nearest clinic, hospital or doctor for investigation.
It could be polio!
Why do we have special campaigns to immunise against polio?
To give TWO extra polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.
This prevents the polio virus from circulating among children.
South Africa is taking part in an effort to eradicate polio worldwide.
It means that the virus will be wiped out completely from the face of the earth,.
Once the polio virus does not exist any more, children will no longer need to receive polio immunisation.
Is it important to immunise children during the first and second round of the polio campaign?
Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the first AND the second round of the polio campaign - even if the child is up to date with the routine immunisations.
To protect children against the polio virus, polio drops need to be given TWICE.
Children who miss the second round will not be fully protected against the polio virus.
Nationwide, starting dates for the campaigns in 2004 will be 26 July (measles and polio); and 30 August (polio only).
The duration of the campaigns will differ from province to province.
Why do we have Measles and Polio Immunisation campaigns?
To give extra measles and polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.
This prevents the measles and polio virus from circulating among children.
Why is the extra measles and polio immunisation for certain age groups only?
The children aged under 5 years are the group of children who most often become ill with measles and polio and spread the virus.
Is the extra measles and polio immunisation only for children who missed their routine immunisations?
No!
All children aged between 0 months to under 5 years must receive the EXTRA campaign immunisations.
Where must I go to make sure that my child does not miss the extra immunisations?
Talk to your clinic nurse, community leaders and employers about the campaign.
Look out for immunisation posters and radio announcements that will indicate the way to the nearest immunisation post.
Special efforts will be made to bring immunisation posts as close to your home as possible during the campaign.
You can also go to your nearest clinic.
Immunisation teams will visit day care centres, crèches and schools during the campaign.
Must I bring my child's immunisation card?
Yes, please bring it along.
It is always important to take the child's and your own immunisation card with you when you go to a clinic or doctor.
Cards may be checked during one of the rounds to see if a child needs routine immunisations.
But even if your child has lost his/her card or has never had a card, please still bring your child to be immunised.
What will I find at the immunisation post?
You will be asked if the child is in the age group.
While holding your child, 2 drops will be given to the child and it will be given again if your child spits it out.
The extra measles injection will be given to children from 9 months to under 5 years of age, on the same day with the polio drops.
Can a sick child get immunisations?
Yes, all children can be given the immunisations even if they have fever, cough, diarrhoea, malnutrition or any other illness.
If you would like to help eliminate measles and eradicate polio out of South Africa, here is how you can assist or become involved.
* Contact your nearest clinic and speak to them.
A clinic nurse will be in charge at the immunisation post during the campaign.
Tasks will be delegated to VOLUNTEERS.
* Tell everybody about the campaign and to bring all the children.
The measles and polio immunisation campaigns are opportunities to contribute to the well being of your children and their future!

Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is Credit?
What Is Credit?
Credit refers to an arrangement where you buy goods and pay for them after you have taken possession of them.
Often you pay off the item in instalments over a period of time.
Examples of credit include:
* accounts at shops (for example, an account at a clothing store)
* accounts at professional service providers (for example, an account at the doctor)
* lease agreements or instalment sale agreements (for example, where you agree to pay for an item over a period of time, like at a furniture store – these used to be called hire-purchase agreements).
You can also get credit from a bank or a micro-lender.
In this case, you are given a cash loan.
You are required to pay back the loan over an agreed period of time.
You are also required to pay interest on the loan.
It is important to note that, when you buy on credit, you are likely to pay more than if you paid for the goods in cash.
To make sure that you know how much you will actually pay if you buy on credit find out:
* the cash price and the extra costs
* what the total amount will be
* how much the deposit is
* what the monthly payments will be
* how long you can take to pay off the amount.
CONTENTS: Credit and Loans
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Agreement?
What Is a Credit Agreement?
When you buy something on credit, you will have to sign a credit agreement.
This is a legal contract and must include the following information:
* The names and addresses of the buyer and seller.
* A description of the goods.
* The cash price and the other charges (finance charges, insurance and so on) that make up the total price the buyer must pay.
The rate of interest applicable must also be included.
* The deposit that must be paid (a deposit must be paid).
* The amount of each instalment, including the last instalment, and the day of the week or month by which it must be paid.
* A note informing the buyer that the seller continues to own the goods until the full price has been paid.
You must be given a copy of the credit agreement.
You should keep this document in a safe place.
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What is Micro-Finance?
What is Micro-Finance?
Micro finance is a broad term used to describe money lending on a small scale.
Registered Lenders
Micro-lenders are encouraged to register with the Micro Finance Regulatory Council (MFRC).
The MFRC is an independent, non-profit organisation that has been empowered by government to regulate the micro-lending industry and protect the interests of consumers.
All lenders registered with the MFRC should have a registration certificate displayed at their business.
Micro-lenders registered with the MFRC operate under different rules to lenders who are not registered.
Most importantly, they qualify for the exemption in terms of the Usury Act which means they may charge you any interest rate.
For services, advice and information, visit the MFRC website.
Information includes details on:
* rights
* unfair practices
* registered lenders
* complaints.
You can also contact them at
Toll-share: 0860 100 406
info@mfrc.co.za or complaints@mfrc.co.za
Unregistered Lenders
Micro-lenders who are not registered with the MFRC, are regulated by the Usury Act.
This Act prevents lenders from charging excessive interest rates.
These rates vary from time to time and the rate applicable depends on the date the loan agreement was entered into.
Currently, these lenders cannot charge interest of more than 23% per year on a loan of less than R10,000, and cannot charge interest of more than 20% per year on a loan of more than R10,000 .
Unregistered lenders are controlled by the Department of Trade and Industry and can lend you an amount of up to R50,000.
Your agreement will set out how long you have to pay back the loan.
You can only cancel a contract with an unregistered lender if you and the lender agreed to this before you signed the contract.
If you want to complain about an unregistered lender, you can contact the National Inspectorate of Consumer Affairs at 011 355 8008.
Tips
* You have three days in which to cancel a micro-loan agreement with a registered micro-lender, if you change your mind.
* Get a written contract setting out all costs and charges.
* Lenders must use legal mechanisms for collecting loans.
The lender is not allowed to:
* ask to keep your bank card
* ask for your bank card number (PIN number)
* ask you to leave your ID book with him
* ask you to leave a grant payment card
* ask you to sign blank documents or documents with blank spaces
* use violent means to collect the money owed.
* No lender should charge an up-front fee with the application, in other words, a fee when you sign the agreement.
* Do not sign a ‘Consent to judgement’ when you take a loan.
* You have a right to ask for a statement at any time showing how much you have paid and how much you still owe.
* You must also receive your copy of the contract within 14 days of signing it.
Grants and Micro-Lending
You cannot use a social grant (for example a pension or child care grant) as surety for a loan.
Lenders are not allowed to hold onto your grants payment card, as security for a loan.
If you are a recipient of a social grant, you will be required to sign a declaration saying that you will keep your grants payment card (also called an Allpay Card) safe and will not give it to a micro lender.
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Profile?
What Is a Credit Profile?
Your credit profile contains your personal details, where and how many times you've applied for credit, as well as information on your paying habits.
Whenever you apply for credit, the creditor will check your profile and decide whether to give you credit based on the information they receive from the credit bureau.
If you have a bad credit history, it impacts on your credit profile for years to come.
Different credit problems are kept on record for different lengths of time:
* liquidations & sequestrations - ten years
* court judgments against you - five years
* negative records (eg unpaid accounts) - three years
* collection records and administration orders - until the debt is settled.
When you apply for credit, the creditor will check your credit rating with the credit bureau, and if you have a bad credit history, they will refuse to give you credit.
This is referred to as "black listing".
You can get your credit profiles from the major credit bureaus for a fee (the fees depend on the information you are requesting).
The credit bureau will be able to answer your questions about your credit rating, and whether there is anything you can do to improve your rating.
There are two major credit bureaux in South Africa:

Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?
When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?
If you buy on credit, the creditor usually remains the owner of the things you have bought until you have finished paying all the instalments.
This means that if you can't pay your monthly instalments, the creditor can repossess the items in question.
Unless the creditor has a court order, they can only repossess the item if they have your permission (this is called "voluntary surrender").
If the creditor wants to force you to return the items, then they will need a court order.
Before they can get this order, the creditor must send a registered letter to you warning you that the payments are overdue and that the outstanding amount must be paid within 30 days.
If you have previously fallen behind in your payments and received a letter of demand, and you fall behind again, the creditor will send a letter of demand giving you 14 days to pay the outstanding instalments.
If you still do not pay, then the seller can get a court order to repossess the goods.
If you are presented with a court summons, you will have to enter a written plea at the court, or file an opposing affidavit, explaining why you have not paid the amount (for example, the creditor may be claiming more from you than you actually owe).
Matters are usually settled without a trial, but if the matter is not settled and you want to go to court to defend yourself, you need to file a Notice of Intention to Defend.
If the matter goes to trial and you do not defend yourself or if the court thinks that you are not justified, the court can issue an order allowing the creditor to reclaim the goods.
The Sheriff of the court is responsible for repossessing the goods.
This official will show you the court order and can then take the goods away.
If the sheriff has a court order, then you (or anyone else staying in the house at the time) must allow them into the house to take the goods away.
Sometimes, the creditor will not want the goods back and will issue a summons against you to get the money back.
In this case, the creditor will have to explain why they can't reclaim the goods.
Will the instalments you have already paid be refunded if the goods are repossessed?
The value of the goods is likely to have diminished since you first bought them because they are no longer brand new.
Depending on the value of the repossessed goods, you may get a refund (if the value of the goods plus the amount you have already paid is more than what you originally owed, then you will be paid the difference).
But if the goods are worth less then the amount that you still owe, then you will still owe the creditor money.
If someone (like a debt recovery agent) has been sent to claim a debt from you and has behaved inappropriately, you can lodge a complaint with the Council for Debt Collectors (all debt collectors must be registered with the council).

Employ People with Disabilities
AUTHOR: Chief Directorate of Communications for the Directorate of Equal Opportunities
This publication provides information about employment of people with disabilities to employers and employees.
"It's time to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity"
* Aim of the Code
* Definition of "People with Disabilities"
* Reasonable Accommodate the Needs of People with Disabilities
* Recruitment and Selection of People with Disabilities
* Medical and Psychological Testing
* Training and Career Advancement
* Retaining People with Disabilities
* Compensation for with Disabilities
* Confidentiality
* Benefits for Staff Members
* Employment Equity Planning
* Education and Awareness
* Information
Many barriers such as widespread ignorance, fear and stereotypes have caused people with disabilities to be unfairly discriminated against in society and in employment.
For these reasons they are a designated group in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.
The Minister of Labour has therefore approved a Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.
AIM OF THE CODE
The Code is a guide for employers and workers to encourage equal opportunities and fair treatment of people with disabilities as required by the Act.
The Code is intended to educate and inform employers and workers to understand their rights and obligations to promote certainty and to reduce disputes so that people with disabilities can effectively enjoy and exercise their rights at work.
The Code is intended to help create awareness of the contributions people with disabilities can make and to encourage employers to fully use the skills of such people.
DEFINITION OF "PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES"
In terms of the Act the focus is on the effect of a disability on the person in relation to the working environment, and not on the diagnosis or the impairment.
People are considered as "People with Disabilities" who satisfy all the criteria in the definition:
* having a physical or mental impairment
* which is long term or recurring, and
* which substantially limits their prospects of entry into or advancement in employment.
REASONABLY ACCOMODATE THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Employers should adopt the most cost-effective mean that is consistent with effectively removing the barriers to perform the job, and to enjoy equal access to the benefits and opportunities of employment.
Reasonable accommodation applies to applicants and staff members with disabilities who are suitably qualified for the job and may be required:
* during the recruitment and selection process
* in the working environment
* in the way work is usually done, evaluated and rewarded
* in the benefits and privileges of employment.
RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Employers should make job advertisements accessible to people with disabilities by identifying the inherent requirements of the post, clearly describing the skills and capabilities required and setting reasonable criteria for selection.
MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING
Tests should comply with the requirements of the Act and must be relevant and appropriate to the work for which the person is being tested.
Employers should ensure that tests do not unfairly exclude conditions and should not be biased on how or when they are applied, assessed or interpreted.
Testing to determine the health status of a person should only be carried out after the employer has established that the person is in fact competent to perform the essential job functions or duties and after a job offer has been made.
TRAINING AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT
People with disabilities should be consulted on their career advancement and possible needs and so facilities and materials for training should be accessible to them.
Evaluation of work performance should clearly identify and fairly measure and reward performance of the essential functions of the job.
RETAINING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Workers who become disabled during employment should, where reasonably possible, be re-integrated into the work force.
IF reasonable, employers should explore the possibility of offering alternative work, reduced work or flexible work placement, so that workers are not compelled or encouraged to terminate their employment.
COMPENSATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
When workers become disabled because of work related illnesses or accidents, the employer should assist that worker to receive the relevant assistance in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injures and Diseases Act from the Compensation Fund and to receive the appropriate benefits in terms of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Employers must protect the confidentiality of information that has been disclosed by a worker or job applicant with a disability.
They must take care to keep records of private information relating to the disability confidential and separate from general personal records.
Employers may not disclose any information relating to a person's disability without the written consent of the person concerned, unless required to do so by law.
BENEFITS FOR STAFF MEMBERS
Employers who provide or arrange for occupational insurance or other benefit plans for workers must ensure that the benefits do not unfairly discriminate, either directly or indirectly against people with disabilities.
EMPLOYMENT EQUITY PLANNING
If people with disabilities are under-represented in all occupational levels and categories in the workplace, the employer should seek guidance from organisations that represent people with disabilities or relevant experts, for example in vocational rehabilitation and occupational therapy to bring those vacancies to the attention of possible work seekers with disabilities.
EDUCATION AND AWARENESS
Employers, employer organisations and trade unions should include the Code in orientation, education and training programmes of workers.
For more information consult the Employment Equity Act, 1998 and the Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities on the website of the Department of Labour at www.labour.gov.za or contact the CCMA helpline at 0861 161616 or the nearest office of the Department of Labour.

Cape Town and Surrounds
The city was once bursting with slaves - they were artisans, builders, coopers, bakers, cleaners, fruit and fish vendors, water carriers, grave-diggers, potters, wood collectors, gardeners and wetnurses.
An estimated 63 000 slaves were imported between the mid-17th century and the early 19th century from Indonesia, India, Ceylon, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Angola and Mozambique.

Van Riebeeck's Fort de Goede Hoop was situated where the Parade is today.
This is where slaves were first housed.
The Slave Lodge (49 Adderley Street) In 1679 a windowless, brick structure was built to house the slaves of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC).
The building's dilapidated and filthy state was reported throughout the 18th century.
Besides serving as a labour force for the Company, slaves also worked in the adjacent gardens, as well as in the hospital opposite the lodge.

The Slave Tree Plaque
The Slave Tree plaque (Spin Street) This commemorative plaque on the centre island marks the site where the Slave Tree - the place where slaves were auctioned - once stood.
Justitie plaats and Whipping Post The south-western corner of Darling and Buitenkant Streets was once a place of torture and execution.
There was a post to which slaves and convicted persons were tied while receiving corporal punishment.
The Company's Garden One of the many gardens worked by Company slaves is at the top of Adderley Street.
The others were at Rustenburg, Groote Schuur, Newlands, Fish Hoek and Simon's Town.
By 1782 almost two thirds of the inhabitants of the outposts (of which the gardens formed a part) were slaves.
There is a symbolic slave bell (not from this period) in the Company's Garden.
Bells like this were used on farms to call slaves to work.
The Company Gardens
Green Market Square
Slave Pricing Auction
Greenmarket Square and the Old Town House Fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables grown in the gardens of Table Valley, as well as produce brought in by farmers from the outlying districts, were sold here by slaves earning their "coolie money" (derogatory term used for slave earnings).
The slaves used a tavern next to the Old Town House for drinking and gambling.
There was also a fountain on the square from which slaves fetched water.

Platteklip Stream
Leeuwenhof (Hof Street) The official residence of the Premier of the Western Cape has an outbuilding dating back to the 18th century that was used as a slave lodge.
Other residences in upper Table Valley also had lodges to house the slaves who worked their commercial gardens, although none of these lodges have survived.
Leeuwenhof's slave lodge now houses an exhibition on the history of the estate, which is open to the public by appointment.

Platteklip stream on Table Mountain This is where household slaves came to do the laundry.
Old Slave Church, SA Mission Museum (40 Long Street) The South African Missionary Society, an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, was founded in 1799 by Reverend Vos of Tulbagh to spread Christianity to slaves.
This architecturally unique church was built in 1804.
Today it is a museum depicting the history of South African Christian mission work.
Other mission and post-emancipation sites with slave connections are St Stephen's Church in Riebeeck Square, the church in Chapel Street and the Berlin Mission in Searle Street, District Six.
Many ex-slave baptisms and marriages also took place in the Lutheran Church in Strand Street.
On 1 December 1838, the day of the emancipation, a service of thanksgiving took place at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Somerset Road).
Until the ex-slave component of the congregation moved to St Stephen's Church (then the Old Theatre) they were accommodated at St Andrew's.
Tel: 021 423 6755
St Stephen's Church (Riebeeck Square) This building dates from 1801.
It was originally a theatre open to all races but in 1829 slaves and free blacks were no longer allowed to attend.
Ironically, this theatre was later used as a mission church for freed slaves.
This caused a public outcry and the windows of the church were shattered by stone-throwing ex-theatre patrons.
Because of this, the church was named after the martyr St Stephen, who was stoned to death.
It is unusual in the Dutch Reformed Church to name a parish after a martyr.
St Andrew's Church
Old Slave Church
Auwal Mosque (39 Dorp Street) The Muslim faith was brought to South Africa by slaves imported from the East.
This mosque's history dates back to 1794.
The property was owned by a freed slave, Salie Coridon of Ceylon.
His daughter married Achmat of Bengal, who later inherited the property and subsequently made it available to the Muslim community to be used as a mosque.
It is the oldest mosque in the country.
Palm Tree Mosque (Long Street) It was built in the 1780s as a house with a prayer room upstairs and the Imam's residence downstairs.
The Muslim congregation of the Palm Tree Mosque has an oral tradition which says that the house was given as a mosque to the Imam by his son-in-law, Jan Boekies.
Unmarked graves (Somerset Road, Green Point) Slaves and paupers were buried in an unmarked burial ground at the lower end of Signal Hill (where the Green Point Traffic Department is today), as well as in the Coburn Street area.
Bo-Kaap and Tana Baru cemetery The Bo-Kaap is inhabited mainly by descendants of slaves who were brought here by the VOC in the early days of the settlement.
This area is characterised by narrow, cobblestone streets and mosques.
Many of the flat-roofed houses date back to the 18th century.
The Bo-Kaap Museum (71 Wale Street) is furnished as a 19th century Muslim home.
Many slaves were Muslim and were buried above the Bo-Kaap.
The burial ground has a magnificent view of the city.Tel: 021 481 39393
Hurling Swinging Pump (Prins Street) There was no piped water in Cape Town and slaves were sent to fetch water from public fountains or wells like this one.

Groot Constantia (Constantia Road, Constantia) The farm Constantia was granted to Governor Simon van der Stel in 1685.
In 1692 he built a U-shaped house on the property.
Constantia wines were well-known in the 18th century and competed with Madeira wine in Europe.
Lady Ann Barnard watched wine being made here in 1798 by slaves "who were dancing in the wine press and beating the drum" and the slaves danced on them softly, the wine running out from a hole at the bottom of the barrel, this was done to slow music...".
At Groot Constantia a few of the slaves were musicians.
Today the house and outbuildings function as a museum containing furniture and porcelain from the VOC period.
Slaves were housed in a building next to the Jonkershuis (a separate building near the main house).
Anna de Koning, the daughter of a freed slave, inherited Groot Constantia from her husband, Oloff Bergh.
She owned 27 slaves.
Tel: 021 795 5140
Old Residency, Simon's Town Museum (Court Road) The museum has close connections with a few of the local families in the area who have done genealogical research on their slave ancestors, many of whom were Muslims.
Some families have kitaabs or diaries going back to slave times.
In the basement of the former Residency there are cells where criminals and slaves were imprisoned.
There is also a Muslim Heritage Museum in King George Way.

Vergelegen (Lourensford Road, Somerset West) This is a working wine estate with an old house, outbuildings and a slave lodge.
In about 1700 Willem Adriaan van der Stel erected an outbuilding that resembled a 17th century European hallehuis - a large three-aisled barn-like structure with a thatched roof reaching almost to the ground.
The slave lodge housed up to 200 slaves at a time.
The slaves at Vergelegen worked as cabinet-makers, tailors, cooks, masons and labourers.
The lodge was excavated for the Anglo-American De Beers Chairman's Educational Trust in 1989.
The remains of a slave woman were discovered under the floor of the site.
She was re-buried on the farm in a marked grave, which can be visited.
There is an interpretive centre on the farm where artefacts recovered during archaeological excavation are displayed.

Slaves were the backbone of the colonial economy.
They outnumbered Europeans, yet it is all but forgotten who built and maintained public buildings and roads in the colony, who did the back-breaking work in the vineyards and orchards of Boland farms, who helped to build the imposing homesteads and who made furniture, vats, wagons, clothes and other forms of cultural material that we still see around us today.
Slave sales were held on farms and auctions took place in Stellenbosch.
Slaves were punished and executed in Stellenbosch in public, as well as in the Old Goal.
Arson, one of the most frequent transgressions, was punishable by hanging.

Rhenish Mission Church (on the Braak) The Stellenbosche Medewerkende Zendelings Genoodschap was established in 1801, and the name changed to Het Stellenbosche Zendelings Genoodschap in 1838.
The society was concerned with the spiritual and educational needs of slaves.
The first missionary and teacher was Meeuwes Janse Bakker and meetings were held at his house.
Reverend Erasmus Smit took over in 1822.
A church was built on a donated plot of ground and dedicated in 1824.
After 1829 the Rhenish missionary Luckhoff worked among slaves on neighbouring farms and started evening schools for them.
The congregation joined the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa in 1948 but kept the name of the Rhenish Dutch Reformed Mission Congregation.
Row of slave houses in Herte Street The Rhenish Mission Church provided a row of houses for freed slaves in Herte Street.
A painting of the family can still be seen hanging in Bletterman House.
The long building on the corner of Plein and Ryneveld streets was originally the slave quarters of Bletterman House.
From 1825 to 1833 it served as a school for slave children under Reverend Erasmus Smit and was equipped with 50 benches.
Since boys and girls were taught separately, a wooden partition was installed between them.
At first the school had 73 pupils, but by 1824 numbers had risen to 124 pupils.
When the school closed, the children were accommodated at the Rhenish Mission Church.
Slaves were also once housed in the western half of the cottage of Grosvenor House (today it is Collins Cottage).
Tel: 021 887 2937
Kromme Rivier (Paul Kruger Street) This estate was granted as a farm to Jan Jansz van Eeden in 1683.
Many structures were erected on this farm during its history, including a 1730's building where slaves are presumed to have been housed.
It was changed considerably over time and today it is a double-storeyed flat.
The property belongs to the Roman Catholic Church and is known as St Nicholas Roman Catholic Priory.

Elsenburg (on the R304) In 1752 Martin Melck became the owner of the farm.
He was also one of the biggest slave owners at the Cape, having 200 slaves at his command.
In his time the farmhouse, slave quarters, outbuildings and a school for slave children were erected.
On smaller farms there were no special living quarters for slaves; they slept in kitchens, attics and barns, or out of doors in summer.
A story exists about Moses of Bengal, a slave from Elsenburg who was sold to the owner of Loevenstein in Parow.
He was mistreated by his new owner and ran back to Elsenburg where he set the slave lodge alight.
His punishment was that he was burned alive.
The old house, outbuildings and slave bell have survived and form part of the Elsenburg College of Agriculture campus.
It is open to the public.

Lanzerac (Jonkershoek Road) Lanzerac, originally known as Schoongezigt, was granted partly to free blacks Manuel and Anthony of Angola, and Louis of Bengal, in 1692.
Interestingly, they also owned slaves.
Other free blacks settled in what is today known as Jonkershoek.
Thus, Oude Nektar (originally Jan Lui) was owned by the free slaves Manquard and Jan of Ceylon in 1692.
Jan of Ceylon also owned other properties in Jonkershoek.
Free blacks were people of slave descent or former slaves who had, for a variety of reasons, been freed by their owners.

Spier Wine Estate (R310 Baden Powell Drive) The historic Spier estate is a well-established part of the wine route.
The property was granted to Arnoud Jansz in 1692 although he had lived there since 1683.
Many structures were built on the property, including a slave house.
The former slave quarters now houses a restaurant.
There is a slave bell which was used to signal the start and end of the working day.

Pniel (R310) The evangelisation of slaves and "heathens" in the Groot Drakenstein valley was started by a number of local Christian farmers.
They provided land for religious activities in the area known as "Papieren Molen".
After the emancipation of slaves, the land was extended to accommodate more residents.
This mission station was founded in 1843 to look after the spiritual welfare of freed slaves.
The churchyard had a church, a parsonage and a school.
In Pniel there is an area know as Masbiekvlei or Mozambiquevlei where freed slaves originally from Mozambique lived with their descendents.
A Freedom Monument was erected in Pniel in 1992.

Goede Hoop (R310) A modern slave bell, dated 1934, marks the centenary of the abolition of slavery.
Boschendal (R310) The farm Boschendal, with its imposing buildings forming a formal werf, is a landmark of the wine route.
During the period of slavery, a long building divided into individual rooms, adjacent to the stables and kraals, was constructed to house slaves.
It is still there today.

FRANSCHHOEK
Estate inventories of this area show that slaves were often the farmers' greatest assets.
They were dependent on slaves for labour.
In 1806 the thriving wine industry in the Franschhoek Valley created a group of prosperous farmers.
Wine and brandy were exported to European countries, and access to British markets after the Second British Occupation of the Cape in 1806, contributed to the economic upswing.
Farms were modernised and farmhouses were redecorated.
The well-known Cape Dutch gable became a symbol of the new prosperity.
Slaves not only worked in the vineyards and orchards, but also as builders, carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers and painters and were responsible for making doors, window frames, shutters, nails, as well as thatching.

PAARL
Gebhart had the slave Joris flogged (139 lashes) for not working to his satisfaction.
Joris was found dead the next day.
After a protracted court case Gebhart was found guilty and sentenced to death.
He was hanged on 15 November 1822.
His gravestone is in the museum, a building which was once the Gebhart family's home.
His father was the minister at the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church).
An example of slave chains and entries into a transfer register can also be viewed in the museum.

Het Gesticht (Main Road) Mission work started early in the 19th century in Paarl.
Het Gesticht was erected in 1813 by the Friends of the Mission Movement with the aim of providing religious training to slaves and coloured people.
Before this, slaves and coloured people attended church services in the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church in Main Street) but it soon became too small to serve the community.
The Paarlse Sending Genootskap took over the building as well as the training programme in 1819.
Nuwe Plantasie (Plantasie Street, behind Grand Roche Hotel) Hermanus Bosman was the sieketrooster from 1707 to 1748 in the Drakenstein congregation.
He applied to the Council of Policy for land in 1715 which, on receiving, he called De Nieuwe Plantage.
Here he built a church for his slaves in 1737.
Kleinbosch (R303, Dal Josafat) In the cemetery on this farm slaves called Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and Clara, are buried.
They were freed slaves who settled with the Du Toit family.
Klaas worked on the farm and his wife Clara worked as a respected midwife from 1830 to 1850.
Kleinbosch belonged to DF du Toit, farmer and owner of Kleinbosch, and the father of the Reverend SJ du Toit, the well-known theologian and leader of the first Afrikaanse Taalbeweging.
Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and Clara
WELLINGTON
Wagenmakersvallei Mission Church (Bovlei) Mission work among the slaves and coloured people in Wagenmakersvallei started in 1796 under JJ van Zulk who counted at least "300 heathens" consisting of Khoekhoen and slaves.
He erected a structure (Gesticht) for this purpose which has not survived.
In 1802 Daniel le Roux was appointed as "oefenmeester".
The church was enlarged in 1868 to its current size.
Two holy communion cups that were used by the congregation are housed in the Wellington Museum
"Queen Rebecca"
The 8th Countess of Stamford
House of Martha Solomons (51 Bain Street) She was the daughter of a slave woman known as "Queen Rebecca" who owned a tavern in Cape Town after emancipation.
Martha, who lived in Wellington, met and married Englishman Harry Grey, the black sheep of an aristocratic family.
After the death of his cousin he inherited a title, and so his wife Martha, a slave descendent, became the 8th Countess of Stamford.
Not open to the public.
An interesting story is that of the Weigt slaves of Wagenmakersvallei.
Their owners, Benjamin Weigt and Anna Lategan, were childless.

Overberg
The name means "over the mountains" - the Hottentots-Holland mountains.
The area was explored by VOC traders and explorers and soon land was given out to farmers who settled there.
With an abundance of land available on the frontier no free person wanted to work for someone else.
The rapid expansion of the colony meant that slaves were also brought into the new areas.
Older male slaves were dispersed among frontier regions on loan farms (the areas of extensive farming) where they worked as herdsmen.
Slave auctions were held at Caledon and Swellendam.
From the days of the Khoekhoen herders, this area had been a stock farming region.
Many of the mission stations founded in this area exist today, for example Genadendal, Elim, Herbertsdale, Slangrivier, Suurbraak, Middleton and Teslaarsdal.

Hangklip (R44, False Bay coast) Runaway slaves from Cape Town would hide out on Table Mountain and slaves from Stellenbosch fled to Cape Town, or tried to reach a group of escapees who survived for many years at Cape Hangklip.
In 1709 a slave, Jacob Smith, organised a large-scale desertion from the Stellenbosch district.
Forty-five slaves escaped and got as far as Swellendam where they were recaptured or returned voluntarily to their owners.
A placaat of 1714 proclaimed that any slave who had been at large for three days or more and who resisted capture could be shot on sight by a colonist.
In 1715 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Stellenbosch sought permission to cut the Achilles tendon of runaways.
Hot springs at Caledon Casino, Hotel and Spa (N2) The Khoekhoen called the hot springs "dispore kamma" meaning "warm water".
In 1708 land around the springs was granted to Ferdinand Appel on condition that he provided bathing facilities for people.
Slaves worked here and rested, using their own facilties.

Teslaarsdal (R326) Johannes Jacobus Tesselaar was a wealthy landowner in the Overberg.
He left an estate in1797 of five farms, 14 male slaves, four female slaves, 125 horses, 60 head of cattle and 500 sheep.
Tesselaar left the farm Hartebeesrivier to some of his slaves.
Direct descendents still own parts of the farm today and the settlement called Teslaarsdal developed on this farm.
Remnants from that period are still visible, and in the graveyard there are graves from descendents Coert, Gertse, Huizenberg, Bredenkamp, among others.
Genealogical research has been done by the Caledon Museum.

Middleton (N2) The Middleton community was established in 1850 with the presentation of land (glebe land) by the Anglican Church to its members, some of whom were of slave descent.
Genealogical studies were undertaken by the Caledon Museum.
Moravian Church started its first mission station at Baviaanskloof, later known as Genadendal, to work among the Khoekhoen of the region.
After emancipation, slaves settled at the mission station.

Moravian Church, GenadendalElim (R317) This mission was founded in 1838 after the Moravian Missionary Society acquired the farm Vogelstruyskraal near Cape Agulhas in the Caledon district.
The newly-established mission became known as "Elim" after the fountains in the area (Exodus 15:27).
The only Slave Emancipation Monument in South Africa can be seen in Church Street near the church.

Napier (R316) Napier was founded in 1838 after the farm Klipdrift was bought from Pieter de Bruyn.
Feeshuis 150, a building next to the Dutch Reformed Church (part of the churchyard), was a wine cellar but was also used to house slaves.
It was restored for Napier's 150th anniversary festival in 1988.
A key is available at the church office.

Struisbaai (R319) In 1766 the VOC hooker (a single-masted ship) Meermin was returning to the Cape with 140 Madagascan slaves and weapons.
The slaves, who were told to clean the weapons, seized the opportunity to take over the ship.
Without navigation skills the slaves had to make use of the crew.
The crew fooled them by sailing in the direction of Madagascar by day and to the Cape by night until they dropped anchor in Struisbaai.
A few of the slaves went ashore where they were captured by local farmers.
The remaining slaves became suspicious and in the resulting skirmish with the crew, the captain ordered the anchor cables to be cut.
Three sealed bottles containing messages were thrown overboard.
The ship ran aground soon afterwards, and the rest of the slaves were captured.
One of the messages that were thrown overboard is housed in the Cape Archives Repository.

The Drostdy (Swellengrebel Street) This was built between 1746 and 1747 using slave labour.
The old wagon shed on the Drostdy museum grounds was used as slave quarters from 1814 to 1834.
The Old Goal dates from the same period as the Drostdy, and is also presumed to have been built by slaves.
The Drostdy Museum is also in possession of compensation receipts issued to slave owners.

Suurbraak (R324) This quaint village nestles in a valley at the foot of the Langeberg Mountains.
Before Suurbraak was established as a mission station in 1809, it was occupied by the indigenous Attaqua people who called the settlement "Xairu" - "a place of beauty".
The London Mission Society established a station here in 1809 and the cottages were built by those who accepted Christianity.
The first missionary was a person called Seidenfaden, invited there by Hans Moos, the leader of the local Attequas.
The church was built around 1835.
Slaves settled here after emancipation.
The first church, parsonage, school, old houses and buildings around the village square have been restored and are in use, as is the Anglican church.
All are situated on the main road through the town.

The Garden Route
Slavery was widely practised in the Southern Cape in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
The VOC outposts of which Outeniqualand and Plettenberg Bay formed a part, as well as the farms of settlers, all have a slave history.
Many villages and towns that originated as missions have a fascinating history involving both slaves and freed slaves.
Caledon Square, later Victoria Square (Courtenay Street) Originally known as the market place, Victoria Square is now a Garden of Remembrance.
It was flanked to the north by the Drostdy and to the east by the jail.
Until 1834, this is where salves were auctioned.

Dutch Reformed Church (Courtenay Street) In 1821 the Church Council decided to build a new church, and by 1830 construction was well under way.
The corner stone was laid on 14 April 1832, followed by a celebratory feast for the bricklayers and plasterers who worked on the building.
The bricklayers and assistants were all slaves.
After emancipation in 1834 they continued their work as "apprentices".
It is recorded that all manual labour was carried out by slaves and that European artisans contributed to the building through cabinet-making only.
The slave bricklayers were Alec, Mirjam, Carto, Adonis and Lasson and the other slaves working on the building were Manjean, Moost, Lange Willem, Jan Rondganger, Willem Bruintjies, Ernest Witbooi, Tune Koopman, Willem Cornelis, Jacob Platjie, Frans Abraham, Aijerdien, Vaaltijn April, Jan Modecam, Willem Hunters, Kobes Wildeman, Fontijn, Jasson, Andries Carolus and Kiewiet.
The church was consecrated in 1842.
It is open on weekdays and Sundays during services.

Pacaltsdorp (R102) This is a small mission station a few kilometers south of George founded by the London Missionary Society in 1812.
He built up a congregation of about 300 Khoekhoen, slaves and free labourers.
Dominating the village is the church built in 1825 of stone quarried from the nearby Outeniqua Mountains with the help of Khoekhoen labourers.

Watsondorp (N12, Preto, east of Blanco) The owner of this farm, a Mrs Bergh, made 30 plots available to ex-slaves.
The land was never formally transferred to the slaves or their descendants.
At a later stage a church and school were erected here to serve the community.

Breede River Valley
Founded in 1820, Worcester is the "capital of the Breede River Valley".
This area includes Ceres, Tulbagh, Montagu, Robertson and Ashton, all known for fruit and wine production.
Mission stations in this area provided a haven for freed slaves, labourers and the dispossessed Khoekhoen.

The Drostdy (High Street) This was built in 1823.
The Bokkeveld slave rebels (see Ceres for more information) were put on trial here in 1826.
Their leaders, Galant and Abel, were sentenced to death.
Rhenish Mission Church (46 Adderley Street) The headquarters of the Rhenish Mission Society in South Africa moved from Steinthal, Tulbagh, to Worcester.
A beautiful church and parsonage were built in 1852 to replace the Gesticht of the Dutch Reformed Church that was used since 1832.
Rhenish School (corner of Adderley and High streets) Missionary Ter Linden started the first school for slave children here on 18 January 1834.
Today this site is part of a cafÉ.
Slave house (R60, next to Kleinplasie Agricultural Museum) This land, originally part of the Roodewal farm, now belongs to the Agricultural Society.
Today the slave house is a bar next to the old farmstead.
Houdenbek Homestead
CERES
Houdenbek A slave uprising took place on the farm Houdenbek in the Koue Bokkeveld, Ceres district, in 1825.
The uprising was led by Galant of the Cape, a slave of WN van der Merwe, and Khoekhoen labourers who killed four people, destroyed crops and then fled.
They were caught, found guilty of high treason, murder and armed robbery, and were sentenced and executed in 1826.
TULBAGH
Also known as Land van Waveren, or Roodezand.
As in many other towns, slaves played an important role in the history of Tulbagh.
Slaves built the second parsonage for the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Land van Waveren in 1765.
The farmers Jan Theron, Pieter Theron, Isaac van der Merwe and Schalk van der Merwe were compensated for sheep, flour, wine, peas and beans supplied to the slaves working on the building.
Jacobus Theron's slaves worked as reed and stone cutters, and the slaves of Jacobus du Toit supplied firewood for use in brick-making.
Slaves also built a wine cellar (1783) and a mill (1790) for the minister.
The minister had many problems with the locals using the mill, and so the church council decided that people who wanted to grind their corn had to supply a slave to do the work, and pay eight stuiwers to the church.
Reverend Michiel Christiaan Vos gave his inaugural sermon to the Roodezand congregation on 4 May 1794, and caused great concern when he announced his intention to extend his evangelical work to workers and slaves.
The congregation's reaction was that "they could already not do much with their slaves and what would happen if they receive an education".
26 Church Street and Oefeningshuis The house was built in 1796 and in 1809 sold to the missionary Cornelis Kramer.
The need arose in the Roodezand Sendinggenootskap to appoint a full-time teacher for the work among the slaves and Khoekhoen.
With the emancipation of the slaves the number of learners rose dramatically, and this influenced the work of the Mission Society.
Gustav Adolph Zahn was the first Rhenish missionary in Tulbagh to assist Vos in his teaching duties.
They also raised funds for a mission church, which was inaugurated on 2 April 1845.
It can be seen in Van der Stel Street but is not open to the public.

40 Church Street This house belonged to Machtelt Smit, the granddaughter of a German mercenary and a freed slave woman.
The Roodezand Mission Society was established here in October 1799.
Today it is a pub and is open to the public.
Steinthal (R44, R46, 5 km outside Tulbagh) In 1843 Zahn bought land on the east side of Tulbagh to serve as an additional haven for freed slaves where they could build a house and have vegetable gardens.
A small school building was erected for the smaller children.
This settlement was called Steinthal and was taken over by the Rhenish Mission Society.
Because of the high standard of education offered here, white children also attended classes.
The table below gives a breakdown of the pupils in 1855.
Today it is part of the Steinthal Children's Home.
The school building is a heritage site and serves as a useful library and resources centre.
It is presumed that the cemetery has slave graves.

Little Karoo
This area is the fertile valley enclosed by the Swartberg, Langeberg and the Outeniqua mountains.
The area was explored by European settlers from the late 17th century, who encountered Khoisan people living here.
The semi-arid area was turned into a productive farming district.
This area boasts the most spectacular rock formations and passes.
Well-known mission stations situated here are Zoar, Amalienstein and Dysselsdorp.
Click here for a map of the Little Karoo.
ZOAR AND AMALIENSTEIN
Zoar and Amalienstein (Not far from the Hoeko turnoff, about 21 km from Ladismith) The Zoar settlement was established in 1817 by Petrus Johannes Joubert, a missionary of the South African Missionary Society.
He named the mission station after the biblical name "Zoar".
When Joubert left in 1833 the South African Missionary Society found it difficult to replace him, and called in the help of the Berlin Mission Society which bought the adjacent land and set up its own station and named it "Amalienstein", after its benefactress, Frau Amalie von Stein.
Here a church (1853), school and houses were erected.
Zoar was run by Reinhold Gregorowski of the Berlin Mission Society from 1837.
In 1838 Zoar had a church and huts forming a village which was inhabited by 300 to 400 Khoekhoen people.
The inhabitants were taught farming methods and religious instruction and received an education.
After emancipation, slaves settled at the mission stations.

In October 1808, 326 slaves from over 30 farms in this region rebelled and marched on Cape Town to demand their freedom.
They were led by Louis of Mauritius, Abraham of the Cape and an Irishman James Hooper, who promised them their freedom.
They concentrated on the slaves of Pieter Louw of the Swartland and spread the uprising towards Koeberg and Tygervalley.
In total 34 farms were plundered, the farmers bound and taken prisoner.
When the slaves began to march to Cape Town, the Govenor, the Earl of Caledon, dispatched soldiers to the troubled area and all 326 slaves were taken prisoner.
Five of the ringleaders were hanged publicly and their corpses were displayed in order to deter anyone of like mind.
Large numbers of slaves worked in the labour-intensive wheat farms and mixed farming areas found in the Swartland and West Coast.
Many mission stations in this area also testify to the missionary work done among the Khoekhoen and the slaves.
The well-known ones are Wupperthal and Mamre, but there is also Papendorp, Troe-Troe Mission station in Van Rhynsdorp and Ebenhaezer.

The missionaries Kohrhammer and Schmidt set out to work among the local Khoekhoen but the mission station also served as a haven for freed slaves.
Today the old kerkwerf (churchyard) can still be seen as well as a mill, bakery, stables and a school.

Goedverwacht, Burgershoek near Piketberg (off the R399 between Piketberg and Velddrif) This settlement was the lawful property of a group of former slaves, who inherited the farm Burgerskloof from the owner, Hendrik Schalk Burger, upon emancipation in 1838.
He left the farm to his slave Maniesa and her five children on condition that they take care of him until his death.
His own children later contested the will, but the court upheld it and the farm remained Maniesa's property up to the death of her last child Hester in 1888.
Her grave can be seen in the graveyard.
Goedverwacht, a Moravian mission station, was established here later when the slave descendants sold the land to the Moravian missionaries for £750.

Wupperthal (R364, 74 km from Clanwilliam) In 1828 two Rhenish missionaries, Johann Gottlieb Leipoldt and J von Wurm jointly bought the farm Rietmond on the Tratra River in the Cedarberg District.
A mission station was established and named Wupperthal after the missionaries' home town in Germany.
A large number of freed slaves settled here after emancipation.
The Rhenish Missionary Society started several industries, namely, masonry, millinery, leather tanning, woodwork, thatching and shoe-making, an industry that is still practised.
Today it is a Moravian mission station.

Students who need to fund their own studies have limited options, such as private loans from banks, part-time employment, assistance from family members and, for the lucky few, bursaries.
For those who are academically deserving and financially needy, there is another option: NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme) offers a unique opportunity to access a loan, part of which can be converted to a bursary.
The scheme also runs a number of loan or bursary schemes on behalf of other organisations and bodies, such as the Department of Labour.
Get more information about these options from the Financial Aid Bureau at the university or technikon where you intend studying or where you have registered.
What is NSFAS?
The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is a loan and bursary scheme operating in terms of Act 56 of 1999 and funded by the National Department of Education.
Where does TEFSA fit it?
TEFSA, established in 1991, managed and administered the National Student Financial Aid Scheme since its inception in 1996.
Act 56 of 1999 converted TEFSA into a statutory body called NSFAS in July 2000.
CONTENTS: Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS

How, What, When, Where ...
What does NSFAS Offer?
* The means to obtain a tertiary education.
* Loans at low interest rates.
* Loans without guarantees.
* A reasonable repayment plan.
What is a Loan?
* A loan is money you borrow to cover tertiary studies.
* This Loan has to be repaid.
What is a Bursary?
* A bursary is that portion of the award that does not need to be repaid.
* The size of the bursary is dependent on your academic success.
Who Qualifies for a NSFAS Loan?
To qualify for a loan you must be:
* registered at a South African university or technikon
* an undergraduate, studying for a first tertiary educational qualification, or
* studying for a second tertiary qualification, if this is necessary to practise in your chosen profession (eg LLB or HDE)
* able to demonstrate potential for academic success
* financially needy.
How Much Money do you Get?
The maximum award in 2004 was R25,000 and the minimum was R2,000.
What is the Role of the University an Technikon's Financial Aid Bureaux?
* Offer advice about loans.
* Assist with loan applications.
* Explain how you access the money and how you have to repay the money.
* Evaluate your ability to succeed in your chosen course.
* Conduct a means test that will determine whether you are really among the financially needy.
Where do you Apply for a Loan?
From Financial Aid Bureaux at the university or technikon where you are/or plan on studying.
How is the Bursary Component of your Loan Calculated?
Up to 40% of the award may be converted into a bursary, dependent on your end of year results.
* If you pass all the courses for which you have registered, you qualify for a 40% bursary.
* If you pass three quarters of the courses, you qualify for a 30% bursary.
* If you pass half of the courses, you qualify for a 20% bursary.
* If you pass one quarter of the courses, you qualify for a 10% bursary.
* If you pass none of the courses, you qualify for no bursary at all.
What Happens if You Have Money Left Over in Your Account?
* You can't receive more money from NSFAS than you require.
* If there is money left over in your fee account at the end of the year (for example, if you received a bursary or a merit award after the NSFAS award was granted), the Financial Aid Bureau has to return the money to NSFAS.
This will count as your first loan repayment.
* Money left over in your account is never paid out to you.
Furthermore, it is in your interest to ensure that the money is returned to NSFAS to avoid paying interest on it.
What about Interest?
Interest on NSFAS awards will be calculated at 7% for 2004 as of 1 April 2004.
What Is Interest and Why does NSFAS Charge It?
Interest is the cost of borrowing money.
Money, like any other commodity, has a price attached to it.
If you deposit money into a bank account, you earn interest - in other words, the bank pays you because it can make use of your money while it is deposited with them.
When you take back your money, you stop earning interest.
If you borrow money from the bank, you have to pay the bank for the use of their money.
In previous years commercial banks have charged as much as 23% interest on student loans.
If you had received one of these loans you would be required to pay back the loan within a specific period whether you are employed or not.
By comparison, NSFAS's interest rate is equal to the rate of inflation (typically in the late 1990s 9%) plus 2%.
This 2% helps sustain the loan scheme.
It contributes towards the administration costs and the shortfall resulting from death and long-term non-repayment due to unemployment.
What is Inflation?
* Each year money loses value and can buy less.
* The decline in the value of money from one year to the next is called inflation.
* An example of how inflation affects your studies is the increase in fees each year.
* In order for NSFAS to be able to assist students in future, NSFAS has to try to make sure that the value of its money is retained.
That is why its interest rate is tied to the inflation rate.
* NSFAS's interest rate is low because it is subsidised by donations from government, private sector companies and overseas donors.
Home > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt Paying Back the Loan
Paying Back the Loan
When Do You Start to Pay Back?
Once you are employed and your annual salary is R26,300 or more.
How Much Do You Pay Back?
* The repayments are worked out at a rate that will not place a great burden on you.
* Therefore, repayments are based on the salary that you earn.
* And repayments only start once your salary is R26,300 or more per year (ie R2,192 per month).
At this level your repayment is 3% of your annual salary.
The rate at which you repay your loan is reflected in the Ready Reckoner Table.
How Do You Pay Back?
* NSFAS sends quarterly statements to all students and will later send a letter information you of your settlement terms once you become eligible to pay back your loan.
This happens once you start earning over R26 300 a year.
* You are then expected to make the necessary arrangements.
These can include a debit order on your bank account, direct deposits into the NSFAS account, postal orders, cheques or employer deductions.
* While NSFAS will inform you how much you need to pay, it is your responsibility to ensure that you keep in touch with

Grants, Benefits And Compensation: An Overview
There are a number of forms of financial relief available to different people in different circumstances, including:
* The Unemployment Insurance Fund
* The Occupational Injuries and Diseases Compensation Fund
* The Road Accidents Fund
Who can claim from which fund?
Grants
There are a number of grants for poor people provided by the South African Social Security Agency.
All grants are for poor people only (a "means test" applies).
Unemployment Insurance
If you have been employed, you can get unemployment insurance benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) run by the National Department of Labour.
Compensation
If you are temporarily or permanently disabled because of an accident at work, you can get compensation from the Compensation Fund at the National Department of Labour.
If you are injured in a motor vehicle accident, you can get compensation from the Road Accident Fund for your medical expenses, disablement, and loss of income.
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Social Security Grants
Social Security Grants
The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has three types of grant for looking after children:
* Child Support Grant
* Care Dependency Grant
* Foster Child Grant.
You can get a child support grant for each child under 14, if you are the child's primary care-giver.
You can get a care dependency grant for each child under 18 who needs full-time care because of a physical or mental disability, if you are the child's parent or guardian.
Both of these grants depend on how poor you are.
You can get a foster child grant if you have been legally appointed a foster parent by a court.
Whether you get this grant depends on how poor the child is, NOT on how poor you are.
However, you CAN get a foster child grant and a care dependency grant, if you qualify for both.
For adults, SASSA has the following kinds of grants:
* Old age grant
* Disability grant
* War veteran's grant.
The old age grant is for women over 60 and men over 65.
The disability grant is for adults over 18 who are not able to work because of their disability.
If you were disabled because of an accident at work, you may be able to get compensation from the Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund .
If you were disabled because of a motor vehicle accident, you may be able to get compensation from the Road Accident Fund.
The war veterans grant is for adults over 60 or anyone who is unable to work because of a disability, and who served in the 1st or 2nd World War or the Korean War.
The provincial Department of Social Development can also provide temporary help in crisis situations with a financial award called "social relief of distress".
This is for people who cannot provide for their families' basic needs because of a crisis of a temporary nature.
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Benefits
Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Benefits
If you have been employed before, then you can collect Unemployment Insurance from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) if you have been unemployed for more than 14 days.
If you have never had a job you cannot claim from the UIF.
Everyone who works for more than 24 hours per month is supposed to be registered with the UIF and to make a contribution of 1% of their earnings (along with contributions from their employer) to the UIF.
If you have been contributing, you can claim benefits if you become unemployed (if you are fired or retrenched, but not if you quit).
You must claim your UIF benefit within 6 months of becoming unemployed.
How much you can claim and for how long you can claim depend on how long you were working and how much you were earning.
You can get one day's benefit for every 6 days you worked, up to a maximum of 238 days (which you reach after working for 4 years).
You cannot claim any benefit for any amount of time that you worked and at the same time received a Social Services grant for yourself.
If you earned more than R8099 per month before, you will get a flat benefit of R101,18 per day.
For example, if you earned R1000 per month before, you will get R17,34 per day.
UIF can also be claimed by the partner or dependants of a worker who has died.
You can also get a UIF benefit if you can't work because of ill-health (for up to 6 months, but takes into account any sick leave).
You can get a maternity benefit when you have a child, or an adoption benefit if you adopt a child younger than two years and have to take off work to look after the child.
Only one parent can get maternity or adoption benefits.
You must apply for the maternity benefit at least eight weeks before the birth of the child.
You must apply for the adoption benefit within 6 months of the adoption order.
You can apply for UIF benefits at any Labour Centre
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)
Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)
The accident must be identified by its date, time and place and must have happened as a direct result of your employment.
For temporary total disablement, you can get compensation equal to 75% of your monthly earnings, up to a maximum of R2 868,00 per week.
For permanent disablement, where the degree of disablement is 30% or less, you can get a lump sum (one payment) which is usually equal to 15 times your monthly earnings.
However, the minimum lump sum is 15 times R1359,00 = R20 385,00 (if you earn less than R1359 you will get R20 385).
The maximum lump sum 15 times R6 963,00 = R104 445,00 (if you earn more than R6963,00 you will get R104 445,00).
If the degree of permanent disablement is 31% or more, you will not get a lump sum, you will get a monthly pension instead.
The pension for total permanent disablement (degree of disablement 100%) is equal to 75% of your monthly earnings.
If the degree of disablement is less than 100%, the pension is proportionately less.
If the employee's earnings are R1 359,00 per month or less, the pension is calculated on R1 359,00.
The minimum pension in respect of 100% permanent disablement is therefore R1 019,25 per month.
Where an employee dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to
* a lump sum equal to two times the monthly pension to which the employee would have been entitled to if 100% disabled
* a pension equivalent to 40% of the pension to which the employee would have been entitled, if 100% disabled.
Where the employee dies, each child under 18 years of age is entitled to a monthly pension equal to 20% of the pension which would have been payable to the employee for 100% disablement, up to a maximum of three children.
The maximum pension payable to the spouse and children together is therefore R9 321,00 per month.
All reasonable medical and transport costs arising from the accident are also paid for by the Compensation Fund.
You can apply for compensation from the Compensation Fund at any of these labour centres.
How does this compensation affect a Social Security grant?
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)
Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)
The Road Accident Fund (RAF) was set up to pay compensation in respect of people injured or killed in road accidents through the negligent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.
The system was changed so that instead of compulsory insurance, there is now a fund, which gets its money from a levy on the sale of fuel.
People can make a claim for compensation against the RAF if they are injured in a motor vehicle accident as a result of negligent driving.
You must make your application to the RAF within 2 years of the date of the accident in which you sustained your injuries.
You can make the claim yourself by completing Form 1 and submitting all the necessary documents; or you can get an attorney to help with your claim.
The exact amount ("quantum") paid out for a claim against the RAF depends on your medical expenses, your loss of income (past and future), your disablement, and your pain and suffering.

How will compensation from the RAF affect a Social Security grant?
If, taking into account any compensation you get from the Road Accident Fund, your income is still below the means test set by SASSA, you may qualify for one of the Social Security grants.
In other words, if your income (including the compensation from the RAF) is less than R1410 per month, you may qualify also for the disability grant.

If you are a parent, make sure you contribute a fair amount towards upbringing of your children, whether you live with them or not.
If you are a relative of someone who cannot afford to contribute, such as grandparents, try your best to help the children: after all, they still need support.
You can also help the children by persuading parents who are not paying or who are not paying enough, to pay a fair amount of maintenance: their children need it.

Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Why Pay Maintenance?
Why Pay Maintenance?
If you do not live with your children, you are not there day to day to provide their basic needs such as shelter, food, clothing, medical care and schooling.
So, you must pay money as maintenance to help the parent living with the children to provide the children with these basic needs.
If you do not pay maintenance, your children:
1. may not have enough food;
2. may not be able to see a doctor if they are sick;
3. if school fees cannot be paid, may not be able to go to school.
Maintenance ensures that your children keep, as much as possible, the same standard of living as before the parents separated.
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt How Is Maintenance Paid?
How Is Maintenance Paid?
Most parents decide themselves how the parent living away from the children should support his or her children and contribute his or her share towards their upbringing.
However, the maintenance system is there if the parents cannot decide themselves how maintenance should be paid, or how much.
The parent living with the children can go to a maintenance court in order to obtain maintenance from the other parent.
The maintenance court can order the parent living away from the children to pay maintenance to the other parent, for the benefit of the children.
The maintenance court will tell the parent how much is to be paid, when it is to be paid, and where it should be paid.
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Must I Still Pay Maintenance if ... ?
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What If the Parents have other Children?
What If the Parents have other Children?
A parent's duty to maintain his or her children continues even if the parent living with the children has other children.
f the parent, living away from the children, is concerned about the welfare of the children, he or she is still required to pay maintenance, though he or she could make a complaint to the welfare authorities or apply to a court to have the children come and live with him or her.
If the parent living away from the children has other children himself or herself, he or she is still obliged to pay maintenance.
He or she must still pay maintenance if her or she now lives with a new partner and that partner's children.
However, there might be a change in how much maintenance a parent must pay if he or she has further children of his or her own.

Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What Happens if Maintenance Is not Paid?
What Happens if Maintenance Is not Paid?
If maintenance is not paid, children suffer, and they:
* may not have enough food;
* may not be able to see a doctor if they are sick;
* if school fees cannot be paid, may not be able to go to school.
Sometimes the parent living with the children may have to go out to work to get money and may not always be able to provide child care or supervision for the children.

The employee may be represented by an office-bearer or official of the employee's registered trade union.

However sometimes, when a person has been commissioned and paid to do a particular piece of work, the copyright belongs to the employer.
For most works it is not necessary to apply for copyright.
Copyright is created by putting the words "copyright" or "copyright reserved" or "copyright Smith 2002" , or the copyright symbol, name and year .
You can obtain copyright in South Africa if you are South African citizen or if your work was produced in South Africa.
If you are not South African citizen, you can obtain a copyright provided the other country is part of the Berne Convention.

Individuals who wish to practice as environmental scientists are required to register with the South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions .
The qualification must:
include at least one subject, other than environmental science, from the fields of practice listed in Schedule I of the Natural Sciences Professions Act, 2003
be based on at least two of the appropriate level-I basic natural science subjects of physics, chemistry, mathematics and/or biology.
In addition to the above a person wishing to be registered in the field of Environmental Science should be able to provide proof of training in Environmental Management .
These can either be part of the four-year degree programme or by way of accredited short courses.
You should have a clear record of environmental science related work and research.
Such Environmental Facilitators should have persons with natural science training in their teams.
Applicants will have to provide proof of their personal involvement in at least two or more projects.
Projects completed will be considered, provided that a clear substantiated indication is provided of personal contribution.
Registration by the Environmental Assessment Practitioners of South Africa will be deemed as sufficient proof of the above.
In addition, information must be provided of conferences attended, scientific papers and publications.
The council will register and issue a registration certificate if it is satisfied that you have the relevant educational requirements and experience as determined by the council.

The detective will notify the complainant when he or she must attend the court hearings.
The police officer taking your statement will fill in a form.
A deceased estate comes into existence when a person dies and leaves property and/or a document that is a will or is intended as a will.
The estate must then be administered and distributed, either in accordance with the deceased's will or, if the deceased did not leave a will, in accordance with the provisions of the law.
The Administration of Estates Act, 1965, prescribes the procedure to be followed for administering a deceased estate.
The estate of a deceased person must be reported to the Master within 14 days of the date of death.
The death can be reported by any person who has control or possession of any property belonging to the estate of the deceased, or who has control or possession of a document by the deceased that is or purports to be a will.
When must a death be reported to the Master?
if the deceased died in South Africa and left property and/or any document that is a will or is intended as a will
if the deceased died outside South Africa, but left in South Africa property and/or any document that is a will or is intended as a will.
Where must a deceased estate be reported?
Although all magistrates' offices are service points for the Master where estates of the deceased can be reported, they have limited jurisdiction and shall transfer all estates with wills, as well as estates that exceed R50 000 in value, to the provincial office of the Master.
If you wish to report such an estate, it is therefore best to do so to directly at the Master's office.
If the value of the estate is less than R50 000, report the estate to the magistrate's office.
If the value exceeds R50 000, report it directly to the Master's office.
If the deceased was living in South Africa at the time of his or her death, report the estate to the Master who has jurisdiction of the area where the deceased was living at the time of his or her death.
If the deceased was not living in South Africa at the time of his or her death, you can report the estate to any Master.
Report the estate by completing Form J294: Death Notice: Death notice and the other relevant reporting documents listed below.
You can obtain the Death notice and other reporting documents from any office of the Master of the high court or from any magistrate's office.
The value of the estate and the type of appointment required will determine which documents you have to complete and submit.
If the value of the estate is under R125 000, complete the following documents:
Form J294: Death Notice
Form J192: Affidavit particulars of next of kin next of kin – to be completed if the deceased did not leave a valid will
Form J243: Inventory
Nomination to act as executor – to be completed by the heirs to appointment a Master's representative:
if it is an intestate estate or
if the will does not nominate a specific executor or
if the nominated executor has died or has declined the appointment
Form J155: Undertaking and acceptance of Master's directions.
Append the following documents to the completed forms listed above:
the original death certificate or a certified copy thereof
an original marriage certificate or a certified copy thereof – if applicable
a list of creditors of deceased – if applicable
a declaration confirming that the estate has not already been reported to another Master's office or another service point of the Master.
If the value of the estate is under R125 000, the Master may dispense with letters of executorship, and instead issue letters of authority in terms of Section 18 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1965.
If the value of the estate exceeds R125 000, complete the following documents:
Form J192: Affidavit: particulars of next of kin – to be completed if the deceased did not leave a valid will.
This affidavit, by the next of kin of a deceased black person who did not leave a valid will, must state that the estate has not been reported to another Master or another service point .
Nomination to act as executor/Nomination form – to be completed by the heirs to appointment a Master's representative:
if the nominated executor has died or has declined the appointment.
Form J190: Acceptance of trust as Executor – to be completed in duplicate by the person nominated as executor
Form J262: Undertaking and Bond of Security – to be completed unless the nominated executor:
is the parent, spouse or child of the deceased.
Submit the completed forms listed above together with the following documents:
an original marriage certificate or a certified copy thereof – if applicable)
all original wills and codicils or documents intended as such – if any.
If the value of the estate exceeds R125 000, letters of executorship must be issued, and the full process prescribed by the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, must be followed.
The service points only have jurisdiction if the deceased did not leave a valid will and the gross value of the deceased estate is under R50 000.
A letter of authority entitles the nominated representative to administer the estate without following the full procedure prescribed in the Administration of Estates Act, 1965.

Return for payment of provisional tax – third payment
The provisional tax paid will be offset against the final income tax that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assessment.
The 'effective' date is
in the case of the year of assessment ending on 28 or 29 February, seven months thereafter
for approved financial year-ends that end on a date other than 28 or 29 February, six months thereafter.
The third payment is a voluntary payment that any provisional taxpayer may make.
Taxpayers with a taxable income of more than R50 000 or companies with a taxable income of R20 000 or more, may make a third voluntary payment to avoid interest being levied on any underpayment of tax on assessment.
The purpose of this payment is to enable taxpayers to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year, and the total tax liability for the year of assessment.
The third period represents the total tax payable for the full year, less:
the employees tax paid for the full year
any allowable foreign tax credits for the full year
the amounts paid for the first and second provisional tax periods.
It is up to each provisional taxpayer to identify when a top-up third payment is necessary.
Obtain the new payment advice from SARS or download it from this site, complete it and submit it together with payment.
Because the payment advice is generic and does not carry detail relating to a specific taxpayer, it is of the utmost importance that provisional taxpayers enter the correct account details on this advice.
If the correct details are not entered, the payment cannot be credited to the correct taxpayer.
The account details are made up as follows:
The tax reference number of the taxpayer
P0003 – indicating the payment period
2005 – indicating the year of assessment.
A typical payment reference number will thus be 1234567123P00032005.
Provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidays.
Where payments are made by mail, via the bank or ATM, sufficient time for mailing or processing must be taken into account.
Where payments are done electronically, provision must be made for your bank's cut-off times and for a clearance period that could take between two and five days.
the client's 19-digit payment reference number
The third period payment should be based on actual taxable income, as the purpose of this payment is to enable you to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year and the full tax liability for that tax year.

Advice to South African citizens in the event a South African is arrested or jailed abroad
Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations , which is the accepted standard for all member countries, persons who have been arrested outside their own country must have access to their consular representative.
South Africans in this situation must immediately request the authorities to allow them to contact the South African Representative in that country.
Alternatively, somebody can contact the South African Representative in that country or the Chief Directorate: Consular Services of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Pretoria on your behalf.
Consular Officers seek to ensure that South African citizens arrested abroad are treated humanely while incarcerated.
Issues such as torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment will be reported and taken up with the local authorities.
The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners is used as a guide.
Establish contact with the detainee as soon as possible after verifying South African citizenship. .
Provide general information about the legal system of the country of arrest.
Information may include details on legal aid and prosecution, a list of lawyers remand, bail and appeal procedures so that he/she understands his/her rights and the processes involved.
Undertake prison visits.
The frequency of prison visits depends on current policy, the location, culture and laws of the arresting State, the prevailing security situation in the country and/or the prison and subject to the Mission's operational circumstances.
Ensure that medical problems are brought to the attention of the prison authorities.
However, the operational priorities of the Embassy/High Commission/ Consulate take precedence.
Local circumstances in the country also play a role.
What Consular Officers cannot do for South Africans detained/arrested abroad:
obtain or give legal advice
organise a release from prison or bail
travel to dangerous areas or prisons for a prison visit
investigate a crime
obtain better treatment in prison than that provided for local nationals, unless the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are not applied
instruct next-of-kin or friends to transfer money
pay legal, medical or any other bills
obtain accommodation, work, visas or residence permits
undertake work done by travel agents, airlines, banks or car rental companies
formally assist dual nationals in the country of their second nationality
in the unfortunate event of death, pay for the preparation, transport, burial or cremation of the mortal remains of a South African citizen.
If a dual national is arrested/detained in another country, of which he/she is not a national, and he/she did not travel on a South African passport but on the passport of his/her second nationality, the dual national must contact the consular representative of the country on which passport he/she travelled.
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
Note: No Prisoner Transfer Agreements exist between South Africa and any other country.
The service standard is determined on an individual case basis and depends on circumstances in the country of arrest.
The Department of Foreign Affairs determines the cost where applicable, based on the services provided.
The South African representative will provide the detainee with the relevant application forms.

Testing of official seed samples
The Department of Agriculture tests official seed samples to ensure physical purity, germination and viability.
Only seed kinds that are declared in terms of the Plant Improvement Act, 1976, are officially sampled and tested to determine their quality.
Official samples are tested in an attempt to ensure that only seed lots that comply with provisions of the Plant Improvement Act, 1976, and that are correctly and truthfully labelled, are offered for sale.
Auditors in regional offices of the Department of Agriculture draw samples at random from trade control and imported seed from persons, i.e. organisations, institutes, companies, co-operatives and farmers, that sell seed.
All available seed lots, that is both commercial and certified seed, are taken into consideration.
Seed lots to be sampled are chosen as follows:
a random choice of seed lots
suspect seed lots
problematic crop types.
Samples are tested for compliance with the provisions of the Plant Improvement Act such as purity and germination or viability.
Auditors are notified of results.
When results show that the seed is not in compliance with the Act, it may be withdrawn from sale or re-labeled.
As this seed testing service is rendered in terms of national legislation, no service fee is charged.
However, if the person from whom the sample is taken requests the test result in the form of a Seed Analysis Report, a treasury approved seed testing tariff must be paid.
An invoice will be issued.
Banking details are:
Bank : Standard Bank
Branch name : Arcadia
Branch code : 01-08-45
Account number : 011244887
Account name : NDA: Seed Testing Services
Remember to include the invoice number in order that it may be reconciled with the issued invoice.
The Official Seed Testing Station uses a priority system for testing.
As the various crop types have different test conditions, the duration of a test can vary from a few days to a few weeks.
Make enquiries at the facility itself .

Free basic municipal services
Free basic municipal services are services provided at no charge by the Government to poor households.
The services include water, electricity, sanitation and waste removal.
These services are provided by municipalities and include a minimum amount of electricity, water and sanitation that is sufficient to cater for the basic needs of a poor household.
However, policies regulating the provision of basic sanitation and refuse removal are yet to be finalised by the relevant sector departments of Water Affairs and Forestry and Environmental Affairs and Tourism .
Free basic water
Free basic water consists of at least a basic amount of 6 kl of water per month per household.
This amount may differ among municipalities and you should contact your municipality directly to find out exactly what the free basic water service is that they provide.
Free basic electricity
The amount of free basic electricity is 50kWh per household per month for a grid-energy system .
This amount of electricity will be enough to provide basic lighting, basic water heating using a kettle, basic ironing and access to a small black and white TV and radio.
Users who have pre-paid electricity meters will be able see when the free electricity is used up and will be required to buy more electricity at their own expense.
Users with conventional or credit meters will not be able to see easily when they have used up their units.
Consumers who do not have access to grid energy electrification could be provided with non-grid energy by their municipalities.
You should contact your municipality to find out the type of alternative sources of energy provided.
To have electricity and water connected in your home or business premises, contact the municipality of the area in which you have a new home or business.
In certain areas, the national supplier, Eskom, supplies electricity directly.
Free basic sanitation
The government has not yet implemented the free sanitation programme.
The Department of Water Affairs is developing a framework for the provision of free basic sanitation.
When the strategy is finalised, the local authorities that provide sanitation services will implement it.
Free basic refuse removal
The government has not yet implemented the free waste removal programme.
The Department of Environmental Affairs ant Tourism is developing a framework for the provision of free basic waste removal services.
When the strategy is finalised, the local authorities that provide waste removal services will implement it.
Paying for municipal services
There are two payment options for municipal services:
Pre-paid accounts
Prepaid account means that you buy units at your own expense and may only use the number of units bought.
Once you have used up all the units, and you still need more you need to buy more.
Billed accounts
Billed accounts allow you to use any amount of electricity or water.
Your municipality will send you a monthly statement showing the amount of electricity or water consumed and the amount of money that you must pay.
Contact your local municipal offices.

NATIONAL GOVERNMENT &gt;
PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT &gt;
LOCAL GOVERNMENT &gt;
Government in South Africa is divided into three spheres: Local, Provincial and National.
Each sphere's responsibilities are outlined in the Constitution.
Provincial government can make and administer provincial laws in its areas of jurisdiction (e.g. liquor licences, provincial planning, cultural matters, recreation, roads and traffic).
It shares certain areas with national government, such as health, education and social services.
Local governments' role includes local service delivery, promoting a safe and healthy environment, and promoting development.
Governments have a political and an administrative arm.
The political arm creates the laws and policies.
Citizens elect representatives to the national parliament, the provincial parliament and the local councils.
The Administrative arm is the part of government that implements laws and provides services.
It consists of all the Departments (e.g. Health, Agriculture).
The governments that are relevant to the Western Cape are:
* The Government of South Africa
* Provincial Government of the Western Cape

﻿Gang activities outside as well as inside schools impact negatively on teaching and learning . 
The school will have to be registered as a FFZ and then officially be declared a FFZ by the Minister of Safety and Security . 
The first step would be to encourage a team spirit within the school and surrounding community and a willingness to engage in a continued process of critical assessment and change . 
Areas of responsibility of the SGB  
Recognising the impact of gang violence on schools  
Link with other FFZ schools and share experiences . 
Refer to Annexure C for a detailed list of the responsibilities of the different roleplayers in the aftermath of a crisis . 
WCED : Division Safe Schools has developed safety structures for schools to support and encourage safety at school level . 
Overseeing and monitoring of the SSC Receiving of monthly progress reports Implementation of recommendations from the SSC Evaluation and assessing of progress  
Procedure Consult with all stakeholders . 
In accordance with the following Acts of general application , the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 , the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 140 of 1992 and the Firearms Control Act of 2000 , a police official may , without a warrant , search any school premise or persons on the school premises if he or she has reasonable suspicion that illegal drugs or a dangerous object may be present on the school premises or person . 
THE NINE POINT SAFE SCHOOLS PLANNING PROCESS  
Threats , intimidation and harassment engender fear and result in the absenteeism of both educators and learners . 
The SSC is a subcommittee of the SGB . 
Invite all stakeholders to a meeting to request their support for the new firearm free zone policy . 
Nobody is allowed to bring guns or ammunition into a FFZ , or to store guns or ammunition there . 
Are parents able to make alternative arrangements for learners ? 
No firearms or ammunition can be brought onto the school premises . 
Body cavity searches and strip-searches may not be carried out on learners . 
This brings with it a terrorising fear factor which traumatises educators , learners and parents . 
The local SAPS representative will help with this process . 
What is the degree of trauma ? 
Inform the community of what it means to be a firearm free zone . 
The principal , in the absence of a police officer , upon reasonable suspicion , can conduct a search of any learner in possession of illegal drugs and dangerous objects . 
Annexure A  
Any person doing so can be charged in court with having committed a crime and can be given a heavy prison sentence . 
Activities outside the school have a disruptive influence on what happens inside the school in a variety of ways . 
Who witnessed the death , injury or trauma ? 
One of the countrys greatest challenges is the high incidence of crime and violence which is exacerbated by high unemployment , poverty and social deprivation together with the ready availability of drugs and alcohol which has lead to widespread substance abuse . 
Will it be necessary for the SAPS and will they be available to escort learners home ? 
Gun free zones  
This can negatively impact on innocent residents in certain areas . 
How many learners will be unsupervised at home in the violent areas ? 
Procedure for conducting searches and seizures Inform your Safe Schools coordinator in the EMDC or Safe Schools Call Centre . 
Official letters should be sent to parents to inform them about the procedures for searches and seizures . 
Maintain the school as a FFZ  
Do you have a mechanism in place to inform parents of early closure ? 
Dangerous object free zones  
The school-based safety officer will fulfil this mandate . 
School Governing Bodies and Safety Committees should be informed . 
This has no standing in terms of the Firearms Control Act , and can only be enforced by using common law and laws around trespassing . 
Murder , gang violence , suicide , shooting ? 
Safety Committee must implement the policy . 
Are the SAPS patrolling adequately ? 
What happened ? 
The Safety Committee must implement the FFZ at the school . 
Where did the shooting take place ? 
No firearms or ammunition can be stored on the school premises . 
Random searches and seizures are prohibited . 
In accordance with Government Notice 22754 , all schools are declared dangerous object free zones . Schools may use the following procedures in creating a firearm free or gun free zone . 
Checklist for closure of school due to Gang Violence : 
Gangs appear to deliberately choose the arrival and departure times of educators and learners to begin their shoot-outs . 
Educators are often absent because they need time off for trauma counselling and debriefing . 
In order for the school to be a firearm free zone the following must be adhered to : 
The school community should agree to making the school a firearm free zone . 
In line with the functions outlined in the South African Schools Act , the areas of responsibilities are the following : 
The school principal needs to appoint a Safety Officer in writing . 
Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 15 
The SSC should consist of SGB members and representatives of religious and sport bodies , management , local business , local SAPS , local government , parents and community organisations . 
Step 1 : Establish a Safety Committee  
Signs must be placed at the entrances of the school to say that it is a FFZ . 
In accordance with the South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 : Regulations for Safety Measures at Public Schools , Paragraph 4 , a police official or , in his absence , the principal or delegate may , without warrant - search any public school premises if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that a dangerous object or illegal drugs may be present in the public school premises in contravention of the regulations ; search any person present on the public school premises ; 
What other tragedies have impacted on this particular school recently ? 
Firearm free zones In April 2001 , the Firearms Control Act was signed into law . 
It is clear that increasing endemic gangsterism is systematically destroying the fabric of large segments of Western Cape society . 
In the absence of a police officer , the principal or delegated educator may conduct a search . 
This impacts negatively on education in general and on what happens in the school in particular . 
Perceived allegiance to a particular gang is usually determined by where one lives . 
A School Safety Committee consisting of a wide range of service providers is the most important element in developing a positive attitude towards critical analysis . 
Where did the death , injury or trauma occur ? 
Should it be decided to close the school and dismiss the learners , when would be an appropriate safe time ? 
A gun free zone is created by a voluntary declaration of a premise as a gun free area by the community or owners of a building . 
If it is felt necessary to close the school , the school principal and the schools Safety Committee must look at the checklist and make a recommendation to the EMDC director or delegated authority who may grant permission for closure of school . 
Educate newcomers about the FFZ . 
Request a police officer to do the search . 
According to the law , the Minister for Safety and Security can declare any place to be a FFZ . 
What constitutes a Safety Committee ? 
South Africa has many challenges . 
Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 19 
Searches and seizures should be included in the schools Code of Conduct and Safety Plan . 
seize any dangerous object or illegal drugs present on public school premises or on the person in contravention of these regulations . 
It can be a school , hospital , workplace or any other area . 
Section 17 of the OHSA prescribes that for every 20 - 50 employees there should be one safety representative on the school premises . 
The only difference is the penalties attached to it . 
Is the shooting likely to continue throughout the day ? 
Daily reports appear in the written and electronic media about high levels of violence , physical and sexual abuse and gang activities . 
Explore alternatives to violence . 
During a search , human dignity shall be observed and persons of their own gender shall search learners in private . 
Procedure for the closure of school due to Gang Violence  A school should preferably not be closed , but an attempt should rather be made to try to normalise and stabilise the school setting as soon as possible . 
This seriously impacts on teaching and learning . 
Procedures Procedures for declaring gun free zones are the same as for declaring firearm free zones . 
Were the SAPS informed ? 
Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 17 . Adopt the policy  
This new law makes provision for firearm free zones . 
Develop a policy  
search any public school premises if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that a dangerous object or illegal drugs may be present in the public school premises in contravention of the regulations ; search any person present on the public school premises ; 
﻿A right to benefits in terms of the Act shall lapse if the accident in question is not brought to the attention of the commissioner or of the employer or mutual association concerned , as the case may be , within 12 months after the date of such accident .

﻿The Portfolio Committee must consult the public about the Bill . 
A Deputy Speaker , also elected from amongst the Members of the Legislature assists the Speaker . 
Committee meetings are open to the public and the most important change is that everyone has the right to attend all meetings of the Portfolio Committees . 
Everything they say or do must be open so that you , the voters , can know what decisions are being made . 
If they want to make a law , they must ask the Legislature to do it . 
The Constitution says that there must be public access and involvement in all tiers of government . 
The party that has won the majority of votes is the party that will have the majority of Members in the Legislature . 
The NCOP forms part of the national legislative process where the provinces can vote as province on matters effecting provinces and as representatives of their respective political parties on matters of national interest . 
The party with the majority of votes will form the government that will rule the country for the next term of five years . 
Every year the Legislature will approve the budget of the province , which sets out the finances that the Premier and each MEC needs to spend during that year in effectively running the various departments . 
He/she is elected by the members of the Legislature . 
It is here that the Bill is discussed and changes can be made here . 
The delegates representing each delegation are from the Provincial Legislature , and reflect the strength of the different parties in the province . 
Every voice is important . 
The Presiding Officer in the Legislature is known as the Speaker of the Legislature . 
One of the rules outlined in the Constitution says that there must be public access and involvement in Parliament and the Legislature . 
You can get the addresses and telephone numbers of these Constituency offices by phoning the legislature or one of the political parties . 
Acting in accordance with the Constitution , each of the nine provinces has its own legislature consisting of between 30 and 80 members , depending on the size of the population . 
After the elections , each of the Provincial Legislatures elects a new Premier . 
The political head of the NCOP is the Chairperson , and one permanent Deputy Chairperson as well as one rotating Deputy Chairperson supports him/her . 
THE PUBLIC HAS A SAY  
The three arms are known as the Executive arm , the Legislative arm and the Judiciary arm . 
This includes Members of the Executive Committee , the Premier as well as the Heads of Department . 
Remember , it is your right and constitutional obligation to inform your representatives about your views . 
POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE  
The Legislature is the second arm of the State . 
Everybody in this country has these rights , but however , must also abide by the Constitution . 
This seperation of powers is protected by the Constitution and ensures that no one arm has all the power . 
Standing and Household Committees remain permanent . Whereas Ad-Hoc Committees are temporary , they only exist for the time that it takes them to finish a task assigned to them . 
However , a Provincial Constitution must correspond with the National Constitution and be confirmed by the Constitutional Court . 
If you want to give your input on any matter discussed on a national level , you can do it through the NCOP . 
The Leader of the House together with the Presiding Officers and Whips of parties helps with the coordination and scheduling of business before the Legislature . 
Besides being able to make provincial laws on the following matters : 
Portfolio Committees can also call MECs and other structures within the departments to reflect on the work done by them . 
New National Party 2 seats  
The responsibility of the Legislature is to oversee the work of the Executive Council , to consider and approve the bills submitted to it by the Executive Council and to propose and consider legislation submitted by their own members . 
Your voice , as well as the voice of all the other citizens of this country , is heard in parliament . 
COMMITTEES ARE MORE INCLUSIVE  
Often they hold hearings or ask for submissions . 
This means that Committees in the Legislature have a very important role to play . 
The Constitution is clear that the Provincial Legislature must have real power to discuss , change or even reject Bills that come from the Executive Council . 
When the legislature is not in session , it may be easier to reach your representatives through their constituency offices . 
These questions may be asked for either written or verbal reply . 
The people you voted for are accountable to you , because it is you who elected them . 
Every year the Committees hold hearings on the budget and how the money in each Department is spent . 
There are three types of committees in the Legislature , Standing , Household and Ad-Hoc Committees . 
The Constitution is the highest law of our land and gives every citizen rights and obligations . 
roads  
If you want to make contact with a Committee , these are the people you should speak to . 
The National Assembly , the NCOP and the Provincial Legislature have a Leader of Government Business . 
casinos , racing , gambling and wagering  
They must make sure that the party administration operates effectively and they must also organise speakers and voting in the House . 
The Premier appoints Members of the Executive Council , from amongst the Members of the Legislature , to head each provincial government department . 
To ensure that the people have the government they support , the Constitution says that there must be an election at least every five years . 
Most of the work on Bills is done in the Portfolio Committees . 
The party that wins the largest amount of votes is the majority party and will form the new Government . 
It is also possible that the Chairpersons of these Committees are from opposition parties . 
They must listen to what you have to say and they must make sure that the views of the voters are taken into account when they vote for laws . 
Each of the various Government departments is dealt with by one of the Portfolio Committees of the Legislature . 
People struggled for a very long time for democracy in our country . 
Each political party has its own Whips headed by a Chief Whip from the majority party . 
The Standing Committees are also known as Portfolio Committees , covering all the portfolios of the Executive Council of the Province . 
The Committees have the power and the duty to ask any person that works for the Provincial Government to explain their actions . 
A Provincial Legislature may adopt a constitution for its province if two thirds of its Members agree . 
The political parties that won seats in the Free State Legislature in the 1999 elections are : 
Committees discuss , make changes , and add the inputs received from the public to the Bills . 
All parties in the Legislature have the right to representation on Committees and quite often the proposals of minority parties are accepted . 
Caucus meetings are not open because it is here that parties must decide on their strategy and on matters which effect them as a party . 
This also means that you have the right to contact any person representing you namely Members of the Legislature , Members of the National Council of Provinces and the Members of the National Assembly . 
Contacting your representatives in the Legislature can be done in one of the following ways . 
road traffic regulation  
The purpose of the NCOP is to give inputs on national matters from the perspective of the provinces . 
urban and rural development  
In an election , everybody over the age of 18 years of age may vote for the political party that they support . 
education at all levels , excluding university and technikon educ . 
The word parliament means to speak . 
Household Committees runs the internal affairs regarding Members and procedures of the Legislature . 
Elections were held once again in 1999 and will be held every five years after that . 
The Committees must take into account the views of the public . 
Different from the other arms of the government , the judiciary are not elected , but independent . 
This means that you have the right to contact any MPL or any Committee if you wish to inform them of your views . 
Members of the Legislature may ask questions to the MECs related to the governing of their respective departments . 
You can also contact your representatives at the constituency office in your area . 
This means that you have the right to attend meetings of the Committees of the Legislature and the Sittings of the Legislature . 
Even if the Committee does not hold public meetings , you have the right to inform the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee or any of its members about matters that may concern you . 
THE LEGISLATIVE ARM  
You can phone or write to them at the Free State Legislature . 
To protect our new democracy we have a set of rules known as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa . 
The responsibility of the Executive Council is to run the province . 
The Committees do much of the important work of the Legislature . 
traditional authorities  
They make changes to Bills that come from the Executive Council and question MECs and Departments about the work that they do . 
regional planning and development  
The Whips are responsible for organising their own political parties in the Legislature . 
This is your right . 
language policy  
provincial public media  
The Legislature can also call on Members of the Executive Council to explain their actions at any time . 
A member may request the House or the Speaker time for a debate on matters of public importance . 
The Leader of Government Business is appointed by the Executive and represents the Executive in Parliament/Legislature . 
trade and industrial promotion  
His/her responsibility is to run and to preside over the meetings of the Legislature . 
Each Committee has a Chairperson and a Committee Clerk . 
These people form the Provincial Executive Council . 
WHO ARE THE PRESIDING OFFICERS ? 
This system is known as proportional representation . 
It is here that the voices of all the people of the country are heard through their elected representatives . 
THE EXECUTIVE ARM  
agriculture  
Each political party that has won enough votes in the election has Members in the Legislature . 
The People of the Province must hold Members of the Legislature accountable , as they are the direct representatives of the people . 
Even where they do not hold hearings , the public can inform the Chairperson or members of Committees about issues that concern them . 
cultural affairs  
The press can attend and report on what is discussed in these meetings and therefore keep the public informed . 
ARMS OF STATE  
The Presiding Officers must make sure that all the Members obey the rules of the Legislature at all times . 
Committees can investigate matters brought under their attention and are also responsible for the majority of the work done on Bills . 
Apart from the Provincial Legislature each province is also represented in the National Parliament through the National Council of Provinces . The NCOP was created by the Constitution in order to build a stronger link between the National Parliament and the nine provinces . 
The nine provinces created in terms of the Constitution brought about a new system of second-tier government . 
Democratic Party 2 seats  
WHO IS THE LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ? 
NATIONAL REPRESENTATION  
During the Sittings of the Legislature the final approval of Bills takes place and the parties can debate these Bills . 
WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 1994 ? 
public transport  
The position of Provincial Government and Local Government , which is recognised as a separate level of government , is entrenched in the Constitution . 
African National Congress 25 seats  
Each province has a delegation of ten people led by the Premier or his/her representative . 
Although it is the legislative arm that makes the law , it is the courts that must punish those that break them . 
Each party holds a caucus on a regular basis . 
The caucus is where the party decides how it will deal with the issues before the Legislature . 
If it is an important Bill , the committee will hold public hearings or ask for submissions . 
Ask the switchboard operator to put you through to your MPL or leave a message for him or her . 
THE JUDICIARY ARM  
The NCOP represents all nine provinces through their respective delegations . 
In 1994 , for the first time , all South Africans over the age of 18 voted for a new Parliament . 
When the Legislature passes a law , it has a duty to take into account exactly what the members of the public feel . 
The power of the state is divided into three parts that function seperately from one another . 
Because of this , the public can effect decisions that are taken . 
The courts are responsible to try people who are accused of breaking the law and if they are found guilty , to sentence them to punishment . 
Debates  
local government  
Nobody is above this supreme law , even the President and Parliament must act according to the Constitution . 
The elected parties must report back on the decisions made in parliament . 
It is at these elections that we all cast our votes for the political party that we support .

how the project will run
if you are an owner of a property you are responsible for maintaining your plumbing in good order and for repairing water leaks on your property .
the people residing on the property , whether it be the owner or the tenant , are responsible for ensuring that they use only the water they need and can afford .
however , during the course of this project all household water leaks will be repaired free of charge .
this will be a once off opportunity .
after the project you will again be responsible
trained community liaison offi cers will be visiti your house to assist you to identify water leaks , to read your water meter , to show you how to maintain your plumbing in good order and how to reduce your water consumption to what you need and what is affordable to you .

after that plumbers will repair the water leaks .
some of these trained restricted plumbers will be assisted to set up small businesses so that they can repair any future water leaks at rates that are affordable to you .
by only using the amount of water you need and can afford and paying your bill monthly you will become a waterwise user .

free basic clean water and waste
every month you are supplied with 6 000 litres of clean water and 4 200 litres of waste water is removed free of charge in accordance with national policy ndigent grant
where the municipal value of your property is less than r100,000 you also have a r20 indigent grant credited to your account .
at current tariffs the water and sewage bill for 11 kilolitres of water is r20,01 incl vat .
if you live on a property with municipal value less than
r100 000 , this means you can use 11 kilolitres of water and only pay 1 cent for water and sewage
how the quantity of waste water
is calculated the disposal of waste water is calculated as 70 of the water consumption up to a maximum of 28 kilolitres per month .
this means that for any water consumed above 40 kilolitres per month there is no additional waste water disposal charge

how the city of cape town uses the water meters
the city sends out meter readers on a monthly basis to read the meters .
sometimes the meter reader cannot read the meter because there is something covering it or the gate to the property is locked .
in this case the city estimates the reading based on the consumption during the same period the previous year .
the city uses the meter reading to calculate the consumption for the period since the last meter reading for a number of reasons :
to calculate the account for water used and sewage disposed and send out a bill .
to estimate any water that is lost in the pipe system that delivers water to the individual properties .
to calculate the tariffs for the financial year .
remember you should report queries and problems .
this will help the city and water services deliver a better service to you .

although the project is referred to as a leaks repair projects , the purpose is to ensure that all aspects around delivery of water and sanitation services to poor communities are addressed .
the end goal is to save water and ensure households only consume that the amount of water they need and can afford .
lekkasies moet in die toekoms tot die minimum beperk word en huishoudings moet die herstelwerk kan bekostig .
the project that is currently undertaken in mfuleni area is the first one under this programme .
this will be a one-off opportunity .
thereafter the individual household owners will again be responsible for the repair of all leaks within the boundaries of their properties .
the city and the water services department responsibilities
to build dams and infrastructure that transport water from the big dams to your doorstep .
to provide for water treatment , thus ensuring that when you get water from your tap , it is clean and safe for drinking , cooking and washing .

why access to information ?
section 32 of the constitution of the republic of south africa act , no . 108 of 1996 provides that everyone has a right of access to any information held by the state and any information held by another person that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights .
the constitution
the constitution states that south africa is a sovereign and democratic state that is founded on the advancement of human rights and an accountable , responsive and transparent system of governance as part of its values .
the system of government in south africa before 27 april 1994 amongst others , resulted in a secretive and unresponsive culture in both public and private bodies which often led to the abuse of power and human rights violations .
it is in this regard that section 32 of the bill of rights in the constitution , provides for the right of access to information held by the state ; and any information held by another person that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights .
section 32 of the constitution in turn provides for the enactment of national legislation that will give effect to this right , by respecting , protecting , promoting and fulfilling this right .

the guide on how to use the promotion of access to information act - act 2 of 2000 - page 39
how is this different from existing services ?
faster .
on trunk routes vehicles will have their own lane , and there will be a regular , frequent , scheduled service on feeder routes .
safer .
there will be security personnel at the main stations and there will be cctv cameras in the stations and the vehicles .
security will be a priority .
drivers will be monitored and there will be vehicle tracking to make sure there is no speeding or reckless driving and that vehicles will be at the stations on time .
comfortable and accessible .
the vehicles will be modern and clean , with space for seated and standing passengers .
the vehicles are also adapted to be accessible to the elderly , children and people with disabilities and to provide space for wheelchairs .
sustainable .
low-emission vehicles and more people using public transport rather than private cars will offer environmental benefits .
affordable .
while establishing the system will cost billions of rand , the aim is to have fares that are comparable with those currently charged .
easy to use .
a smart card system will be used that will allow passengers to transfer from one trunk route to another on a single fare .
these cards will be widely available , at stations and through other retailers .
what does this mean for passengers ?
the service will run for far longer ― during the day , into the evening and at weekends and will be regular , frequent and reliable .
once the full system is in place , people will be able to travel around the city to visit friends and family , shopping centres and places of leisure , and tourists will be able to get around easily .
the aim is to have easy access between the system and other ways of getting around , such as walking , cycling , metered taxis , and park-and-ride facilities .
a non-motorised transport plan is being developed for each of the stations .
what does this mean for people in private vehicles ?
where special busways are envisaged , some road space will be lost to private motorists , and traffic signals will prioritise public transport vehicles .
this will encourage people using private cars to switch to using the new system .
the separation of public transport from general traffic can be beneficial to both public transport and cars .
the bus-minibus taxi lane on the n2 has saved private cars over 20 minutes in travelling time .
streets where private motorists will lose road space to the new system are parts of the r27 and in the centre of town at hertzog boulevard , heerengracht , parts of adderley street , hans strijdom avenue and parts of western boulevard .
who will run the system ?
the city of cape town will build the special busways and specify the levels of service , cost of the fares and the kinds of vehicles to be used .
private sector companies will provide the actual operations and services .
the operator will be paid on the basis of how many kilometres the vehicles travel and by meeting other performance standards .
there will be a separate tender process for an independent company to collect the fares .
there will also be an oversight agency established to monitor the quality of the service and to deal with complaints from the public .
what does this mean for the current operators ?
the city of cape town is talking to representatives of the bus and minibus industry in order to ensure that they play a central role in the new system .
the objective is to achieve a high quality of service while improving profitability and working conditions in the industry .
what does this mean for workers in the industry ?
the new system is expected to create many jobs , not just in the construction phase but also in the operations .
working for the new system will mean permanent jobs with all the benefits of formal employment , such as job security , regular hours of work , predictable income , leave , sick leave and maternity benefits .
the new system will have many benefits for workers in the industry .
where is the money for this project coming from ?
the system is being financed through support from national government and the city of cape town .
all three spheres of government , including the western cape provincial government , are committed to transforming public transport in cape town .
much of the funding is being made available to meet the cape towns requirements for hosting the 2010 world cup .
when will all this happen and how will it affect me ?
all the phase 1a routes are planned to be operating by march 2010 , which will allow time to iron out the inevitable teething problems by the time the world cup begins in june .
from the end of 2008 , construction work can be expected on the main parts of the route ― especially in the city centre and on the green point / sea point route and between the city and bayside mall , along blaauwberg road and up to the du noon area .
careful planning is being done to minimise any traffic impacts during construction .
how can i get more information ?
erm has been appointed by the city to engage the communities that will be directly affected by phase 1a .
in late 2008 they will be contacting representatives of these communities and holding public events to explain the proposals in more detail .
if you are interested in being involved in these public processes , please contact linda slabber by phoning 021 702 9100 or by emailing linda.slabber @ erm.com .
the irt is a way of ensuring that all modes of public transport work together and have priority over private transport .
a major part of this is a bus rapid transit system ― a fast , modern road-based system .
cape towns irt system will be based on examples of rapid transit systems that are working well in many parts of the world , including latin america , asia , north america and australia .
it can work well here too , giving capetonians a regular , frequent , fast and reliable form of public transport .
how will the irt work ?
there will be two parts to the service :
trunk routes
feeder routes
on the trunk routes there will be separate , dedicated busways for special 18-metre articulated vehicles .
there will be weatherproof , enclosed stations in the centre of the road on these routes , which will ensure that the vehicles can move quickly past other traffic and that people can wait in safety and comfort .
the feeder services , with shorter 8m and 12m vehicles , will carry people to the trunk routes in normal traffic with stations along the side of the road .
each vehicle will have several wide doors that open level with the station platform so that lots of people can get in and out quickly .
the service will operate for 18 hours a day and vehicles will be frequent .
the frequencies will range between a few minutes in peak hours and at least three times an hour when there is less demand .
fares will be affordable and comparable with those charged by buses and minibuses at the moment .
where will the system go ?
the city of cape towns aim is to establish an irt network across the city within 10 to 12 years .
the network will ensure that over 75 of the people are within 500 meters of a high-quality public transport system .
this can only be achieved one step at a time .
there are four phases for rolling out the irt .
the first phase will be done in two steps , one to be completed before the world cup in 2010 and the other soon after the event .
phase 1a : this phase will provide a link from the airport to the city centre and from the city centre to green point , sea point and hout bay , and around the city bowl suburbs .
phase 1b : the proposed routes will extend the first phase to include special busways to century city and
montague gardens and busways from the airport to bellville and durbanville , strand and gordons bay , claremont and constantia , and table view via century city .
phase 2 : this phase will link the densely populated south east of the city , which includes mitchells plain and khayelitsha , to destinations across the peninsula .
phases 3 and 4 : the final phases will expand and link routes to the complete network , including areas such as delft , blue downs and stellenbosch .
what exactly will phase 1a include ?
the map has solid lines representing trunk routes and dotted lines showing feeder routes .
there will be two trunk routes :

cape town is getting an integrated rapid transit system
this document outlines :
what an integrated rapid transit system is
how the system will work
where the system will go
how the system will affect commuters , existing operators and other road users
when the project will be implemented
the solid red line shows the route from the v & a waterfront , through the centre of cape town , through paarden eiland to bayside centre and along blaauwberg road to du noon , doornbach and killarney gardens .
feeder routes , marked by dotted lines , will run around the city bowl suburbs , from the end of sea point to camps bay and on to hout bay , and from camps bay over kloof nek to town .
on the west coast , the feeder services will run around table view and parklands , to bloubergstrand and atlantis , including the atlantis industrial area and saxonsea , and to mamre .
the feeder service will also run along racecourse road , through montague gardens to century city and richwood .
how did the city decide upon phase 1a ?
as a host city for the 2010 soccer world cup , the city of cape town has signed a contract with fifa to provide transport services between the airport , the city centre and the green point stadium area .
phase 1a also focuses upon delivering quality public transport to the west coast which includes some of the communities with the most pressing mobility needs , such as mamre , atlantis , doornbach , du noon , and the joe slovo informal settlement , near milnerton .
this west coast area also currently experiences some of the most severe traffic congestion .
on 27 august 2008 the city of cape town gave the go-ahead for phase 1a , and approved the budget of r1.3 billion .

the city of cape towns budget & municipal account 2003 / 2004
the budget seeks to strike a balance between the massive development challenges of poor areas , especially the informal settlements , and the need to maintain our cbds and the world-class infrastructure in established areas , says mayor nomaindia mfeketo .
while much of our operating budget of r8,4 billion will be spent on maintaining high levels of service in established areas , the capital budget of r1,7 billion will be directed at poorer areas , in particular upgrading informal settlements which house an estimated 15 of our population .
vanjaar sal die stad byna r300 miljoen op die stadspolisie bestee wat die ontplooiing van ' n verdere 100 beamptes insluit .
die tarief is gebaseer op die bestuur van wateraanvraag deur ' n hoër tarief vir groot hoeveelhede te hef en ' n basiese voorsiening van gratis water aan elke huishouding .
your municipal account
whats new this year ?
more free electricity , cheaper water up to 12 kl , and a new way to calculate sanitation charges .
but the good news is that typical households with a property value of r200 000 or less should pay less than inflation increases and those valued at under r100 000 will pay less than last year with present consumption patterns .
for higher value properties , with a traditionally high consumption of water and electricity , the key is to manage the consumption of these resources .
water
cape town is an area facing a long-term water shortage the tariff is based on managing water demand by charging a higher rate for large quantities of water used and providing a basic supply of free water to every household .
the first 6kl are free for everyone.to assist residents , the price for 6kl - 12kl has been reduced to below average cost by introducing a new step in the water tariff .
for anyone using less than 15kl a month , the water bill will come down .
water tariffs for
kl r2.00 per kl kl r4.00 per kl kl r5.10 per kl kl r6.20 per kl kl and above r8.00 per kl sanitation
sanitation levy
residential properties 0,153 cents in the rand
industrial and commercial properties 0,218 cents in the rand
consumption tariff
sanitation tariffs for domestic users
excludes vat 4,2 kl free

did you know ?
if you cut your water consumption , your sanitation bill will drop too .
electricity
there are two domestic tariffs .
council will place you on the most beneficial tariff for your consumption , but you can override this and choose which tariff to use .
solid waste
keeping our city clean and managing waste is complex and expen-sive.the cost is recovered through a levy based on property value and a refuse collection tariff.the money collected from the levy based on property value pays for area cleaning .

security and working conditions will be better with the new system .
new opportunities for the minibus taxi industry
the minibus taxi industry has played an important role in keeping the people of cape town on the move .
taxi operators saw an opportunity in the lack of public transport in township areas , and now operate across the city .
even though they did not receive subsidies , minibus taxi operators have provided customised services that other modes have not been able to offer .
today , the industry and the market are changing .
the minibus taxi industry is faced with many pressures , including rising fuel prices , rising labour costs and competition from private cars .
the system entails existing operators joining forces to become shareholders in new operator businesses .
these businesses will provide regular transport services on designated trunk and feeder routes by operating and managing fleets of new vehicles .
there would be a number of advantages , including :
predictable income , because the state will pay the operators per kilometres travelled rather than for the number of passengers carried
dedicated lanes , enabling more runs in the busy peak periods good working conditions for employees , with better pay , training , shorter hours and more career opportunities
a bigger market for public transport as people switch from private cars to the new system
the new system offers existing operators an opportunity to grow their businesses , and participate in a new system that will change our city for the better .
the city of cape town sees those minibus taxi and bus operators whose services will be upgraded by the irt , as preferred partners .
already , operators in the minibus taxi industry have started to grow and diversify their businesses , taking up opportunities in tourism , and learner and student transport .
some have even expanded into related industries , including fuel stations , vehicle dealerships , parts and maintenance .
the minibus taxi industry is maturing , and the entrepreneurs who lead it have shown that they can build and expand their businesses .
as the city of cape town moves ahead with integrated rapid transit , it is looking for a strong partnership with existing operators in planning and developing the system , and ultimately becoming the operators of the new service .
the existing minibus and bus industries must have a voice in shaping the new system .
their expertise will be important in delivering a quality product to the customer .
increased profitability
the new system will deliver increased profitability for operators .
this will be achieved through dedicated lanes , a better fuel economy , bulk buying of new kinds of vehicles and parts , and coordinated marketing and advertising to attract new customers .
a level playing field
the minibus taxi industry has never received operating subsidies from government .
there has long been a sense of unfairness , as some operators are compensated , while others are not .
in the new business model , all operators will be treated equally on a level playing field .
in addition , government will provide capital subsidies to all .
building a partnership with minibus taxi operators
a better way of moving people transforming transport in cape town
the city of cape town is proposing to make far-reaching changes to the citys transport system with the introduction of the integrated rapid transit system .
the city of cape town is engaging with minibus taxi operators to form a partnership to make this a reality .
minibus taxis keep cape town moving
the minibus taxi industry has played an important and historic role in moving the people of cape town .
the industry is the critical link ensuring that ordinary people and low-income communities access jobs and other opportunities throughout the city .
while the minibus taxi industry grew despite the difficulties experienced during the apartheid era , it has continued to contribute to south african society up to the present day , and will no doubt continue to do so .
in addition to the vital transport services the industry provides , it is also a large employer , and many families and communities depend on the industry for their livelihood .
with its important history and contribution to the local economy , the city of cape town wants all existing operators to participate in and benefit from the new system .
an example of a trunk bus .
phase 1a : 2008 ― march 2010
the first phase is a pilot or demonstration phase for the rest of the project , and focuses on the areas of the city that need special transport services for the 2010 fifa world cuptm .
this phase will serve as a way to test operations , and make necessary adjustments .
it will also give the industry across the city an opportunity to see how the system will work , and the range of opportunities it offers for the minibus taxi industry as a whole .
this will include a link from the airport to the city centre , and from the city centre to green point , sea point and hout bay , and around the city bowl suburbs .
there will be a route up the west coast to bayside mall , the full system .
along blaauwberg road and up potsdam road to du noon , and services to bloubergstrand , atlantis and mamre , as well as around table view and parklands , and through montague gardens via century city to richwood .
phase 1b : after 2010
the proposed routes will extend the first phase to include special busways to maitland station , century city and montague gardens , as well as additional airport services to bellville , durbanville , claremont , wynberg and constantia .
phase 2
this phase will link the densely populated south east of the city , which includes mitchells plain and khayelitsha , to destinations across the peninsula .
phases 3 and 4
the final phases will expand and link routes to the complete network , including areas such as delft , blue downs and stellenbosch .
under pressure
challenges facing the industry
more congestion
more congestion means slower speeds for public transport .
in turn , the slow speeds increase costs , such as fuel costs and wear and tear on the vehicles .
congestion also makes travel times longer for customers , which discourages public transport use .
be under threat over the coming decades as private vehicle ownership increases .
unless the quality of public transport is dramatically increased , capetonians will continue flocking to private cars at an ever-faster rate .
already , there are more than a million cars in cape town , approximately one car for every three people .
supply .
this will continue to drive up the price of oil .
also , south africa is a net importer of oil , producing only a limited amount of oil ourselves , making us dependent on oil producers in other parts of the world .
this will continue to place pressure on our economy into the future , calling for more efficient use of this limited natural resource .
more cars , less public transport
each year , private car ownership is increasing in cape town .
as incomes increase , more people are abandoning public transport for private cars .
if the current trend continues , the very existence of the minibus taxi industry will increasing private car ownership in cape town , between 2001 and 2007 .
unpredictable fuel costs
over the last months , the cost of fuel has increased considerably as a result of increasing oil prices and the weak rand .
all indications are that the price of oil and petrol will continue to rise .
many analysts believe that the extraction of oil from the earth has reached its peak , and that demand for oil will begin to exceed
permit problems
the permitting system for the minibus taxi industry is not working as well as it should .
currently , the perception is that some routes are overtraded , with too many permits issued .
on the other hand , the waiting time for the processing of applications is very long .
what is hijacking ?
hijacking is the violent theft of a motor vehicle from its owner or driver , and is not classified as a specific crime .
the actual offence is robbery and may include aggravated circumstances .
robbery is defined as the unlawful and intentional violent removal and appropriation of moveable corporeal property belonging to another person , where force or the threat of force is used .
characteristics of hijackings
all hijackings occur unexpectedly .
most hijackings are planned .
provocation is not a prerequisite for a hijacking .
hijackings occur at anytime , day or night .
hijackings can happen anywhere , in urban or rural areas .
any vehicle can be targeted , depending on the demand for it .
common hijacking situations
you could be hijacked ―
while stationary on freeway on or off ramps ;
while loading goods at home or at work ;
while loading passengers ;
while stationary on the side of the road ;
while stationary in a parking area ;
while stationary at stop signs or traffic lights ;
at home , at your gates or in your driveway ; and / or by ambush .
hijacking prevention
when approaching your vehicle , have your car keys ready and lock all doors immediately once you are inside your vehicle .
keep your car and house keys on separate key chains .
make sure you are not being followed .
when approaching a traffic light at night or in secluded areas , reduce speed to avoid having to bring your vehicle to a complete stop .
turn the radio down and observe all approach angles to your vehicle .
if a suspicious person approaches ― and it is safe for you to do so ― drive away .
keep your vehicle in first gear when stationary ― this will allow for a quick getaway in the case of an emergency .
maintain sufficient escape space between vehicles when stationary .
if you cannot afford to have safety film fitted to your vehicles windows , always leave an opening of ± 5 cm from the top .
do not leave valuable items , like handbags , cellphones or laptops on the passenger or back seat ― lock these items in the boot .
kids and car safety seats : put the child in the car safety seat è get into the car è lock all the doors è finish buckling up the child .
when trying to buckle up children and you are bent over into the car , it is impossible to see what is going on around you !
when driving alone , let a family member or friend know the route you are taking and the expected time of arrival at your destination .

the integrated coastal
management bill
a brief guide to assist the public participation process environment & tourism department :
environmental affairs and tourism
parliament requires the publication for public comment of bills in the government gazette before such bills are introduced in parliament for the purpose of promulgating them as legally binding acts .
this is in line with the constitutional imperatives that government ensures accountability , responsiveness and openness .
during the first week of december 2006 the cabinet approved the publication in the government gazette of the integrated coastal management bill for public comment .
in a press release issued on 8 december 2006 , marthinus van schalkwyk , the minister of environmental affairs & tourism , announced that the bill would be gazetted on 15 december 2006 .
the minister pointed out that due to its complexity the bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days .
the text of the bill is available from the government printer or can be downloaded from http : / / www.deat.gov.za / .
the purpose of this guide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period .
the guide seeks to achieve this by first explaining the historical context leading to the publication in 2000 of the white paper for sustainable coastal development in south africa which provided a national policy for managing our coastline .
this guide then briefly explains the purpose of each chapter of the bill and provides an outline of its content .
when the bill becomes an act of parliament south africa will for the first time have a national coastal management act in place for managing our coastal zone , a priceless national asset .
the publication of the bill for comment therefore represents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders , interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed integrated coastal management act .
why is there a need for a national coastal management act ?
the questions are often raised ― why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation ― is the coast not simply part of the general environment and is it not already covered by existing environmental legislation ?
answers to these questions are discussed below .
the coast is a unique part of the environment .
it is the meeting place of the land and sea ― a limited spatial area that supports many human activities .
the coast is a distinctive system in which a range of considerations ― biophysical , economic , social and institutional ― interconnect , in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach .
the coast needs to be managed as a system in order to make optimal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides .
however , this system ― orientated approach has failed to materialize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach focusing on their specific sectors such as land-use planning , agriculture , water affairs , nature conservation and others .
this bill promotes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management , which views the coast as a system and emphasizes the importance of managing it as such .
in the past , the value of coastal ecosystems as a cornerstone for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in decision-making in south africa .
the white paper highlights the importance of recognising the value of the coast .
the value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estimated in 1998 to be about r168 billion annually , which was equivalent to about 35 of our annual gross domestic product .
much of the wealth locked up in our coast continues to be wasted due to environmentally insensitive development and activities .
economic and social opportunities for wealth creation and equity are being missed and coastal ecosystems are being degraded .

photo : csir natural resources and the environment
how we manage our coastal areas will determine whether they remain valuable assets or become degraded liabilities .
the white paper also emphasizes the importance of facilitating coastal development which is sustainable .
this requires development to be ecologically , socially and economically sustainable .
for coastal development to be ecologically sustainable , it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources .
for coastal development to be socially sustainable , it should emphasise public awareness and shared responsibility , empowering disadvantaged individuals and communities , including women and the poor .
for coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diversify opportunities , provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources .
the white paper did not merely provide a vision , principles , goals and objectives for coastal management in south africa .
it took a step further by providing a plan of action which outlines in detail how the white paper is to be implemented .
one of the elements of this plan of action is institutional and legal development .
after the cabinet approved the white paper a comprehensive legal review was carried out .
its purpose was to determine whether the white paper could be implemented in terms of existing laws .
the review concluded that a dedicated coastal management act was required for implementing the white paper .
the contents of the bill
preamble
the preamble explains the rationale or basis for promulgating the proposed integrated coastal management act .
several factors forming part of this basis are discussed above .
chapter 1 : interpretation , objectives and application of act
this chapter defines important words and terms , sets out the objectives of the proposed act in order to guide the interpretation and application of the act , clarifies the role of the state in relation to the coastal environment , indicates to whom and where the act applies and explains that the act must be read in conjunction with the national environmental management act and explains how to reconcile conflicts with other legislation .
chapter 2 : the coastal zone
the bill focuses on regulating human activities within , or that affect the coastal zone .
the coastal zone is illustrated in figure 1 and defined as the area comprising coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , coastal access land , specially protected coastal areas , and includes any aspect of the environment on , in and above them .
at the heart of the coastal zone is an area of land and water defined as coastal public property , which is the common property of the people of south africa .
this contrasts with the current situation under the seashore act where the seashore and sea are owned by the president on behalf of the people.coastal public property is made up primarily of the seashore and coastal waters .
die beperking of beheer van ontwikkeling in hierdie areas is ook noodsaaklik ten einde die dinamiese aard van die kus in ag te neem en om mense en eiendom te beskerm teen skade weens natuurlike oorsake , soos kuslynerosie en vloede , of nuwe bedreigings soos die styging van seevlakke as gevolg van aardverhitting .
the bill provides that initially the coastal buffer zone would extend one hundred metres inland from the boundary of coastal public property in areas that have already been zoned for residential , commercial , industrial or multiple-use purposes , and one kilometre inland in other areas .
for example , in developed areas where the coastal environment has been highly modified , such as durbans beachfront and sea point in cape town , the width of the coastal buffer zone could be reduced to less than 100 metres .
in order to secure public access to coastal public property , the bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land .
certain land will be regarded as coastal access land when the bill is enacted but the designation of coastal access land may also be withdrawn or cancelled .
reasons for withdrawing such designation could include instances where the use of coastal access land is causing damage to the environment .
the process for designating or withdrawing the designation of coastal access land is described in section 19 .
the responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20 .
in the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors .
early drafts of the integrated coastal management bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas .
however , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the protected areas act rather than the proposed integrated coastal management act .
protected areas or parts thereof are automatically included in the buffer zone in terms of section 16 .
the purpose of section 22 is to enable the mec to declare that protected areas or parts thereof are not part of the buffer zone .
section 23 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 deals with the management of such areas .
this is intended to provide a mechanism for establishing special management arrangements in a particular area in order to give effect to the recognition in the white paper that the diversity of the coast requires different management approaches in different areas .
a special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas , rather than as conservation areas .
for example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable harvesting of shellfish for subsistence purposes in areas where such harvesting is presently depleting the shellfish resources .
section 25 authorises mecs to establish coastal setback lines .
once such a line has been established in a zoning scheme , any person who wishes to erect or alter a structure situated seaward of the line must obtain permission before doing so .
a coastal setback line may , for example , be established to ensure that the shadows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise .
chapter 3 : boundaries of coastal areas
this chapter provides procedures for demarcating and adjusting the boundaries of coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , special management areas and coastal access land .
it also sets out the considerations which must apply in respect of such demarcations and adjustments .
demarcation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal buffer zone are only likely to be instituted where the area designated by the act is inappropriate and impedes effective coastal management .
a chapter of the bill focuses on estuaries which are much sought after for recreation
this chapter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all estuaries by providing that they must be managed , in accordance with : a
the protocol will provide a national policy for estuary management and guide the development of individual estuarine management plans .
chapter 5 : institutional arrangements
the white paper recommended new arrangements to coordinate coastal management in south africa .
this chapter establishes a statutory framework for new institutional arrangements to ensure integrated and coordinated coastal management .
section 35 establishes a national coastal committee which will function at national government level .
section 36 authorizes the minister to determine the composition of the committee .
section 37 provides for the designation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level .
section 38 provides for the establishment of provincial coastal committees which will be responsible for coordinating coastal management in each province .
section 39 authorizes the mecs of each province to determine the composition of these committees .
section 40 authorizes the mecs to appoint voluntary coastal officers and define their roles and responsibilities .
this provision helps facilitate a new cooperative and participatory approach to managing the coast by enhancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management .
chapter 6 : coastal management
this chapter establishes new management and planning procedures for coastal resources to ensure that development is sustainable , integrated and in the interest of all user groups .

these national , provincial and municipal cmps must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover , set coastal management objectives and include priorities and strategies for achieving these and performance indicators that can be used to measure progress .
section 49 requires the alignment of certain plans with cmps to ensure coordinated coastal management .
similarly section 50 requires consistency between cmps and other statutory plans .
in practice this means , for example , that the minister must ensure that there is consistency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans .
procedures relating to public participation in respect of decision-making in accordance with the proposed act are set out in sections 51-52 .
the powers of the minister and the mecs to review provincial and municipal cmps respectively are set out in sections 53-54 .
section 55 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish zoning schemes .
section 56 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal zoning schemes .
the coastal resource use planning system established by this chapter will function as a mechanism for controlling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is presently used .
importantly , it will provide a mechanism for translating the results of research regarding how coastal resources should be used and the maximum use that should be made of coastal resources , into a legally enforceable system for managing the coastal zone .
chapter 7 protection of coastal resources
this chapter provides measures for protecting the coastal environment from activities that may detrimentally affect it and creates procedures for assessing and regulating such activities .
section 57 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occupiers of land , coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adverse effects on the coastal environment in accordance with section 28 of the national environmental management act , referred to below as nema .
section 58 stipulates the requirements which apply to the authorisation of activities causing adverse effects .
section 59 provides for the minister or mec to issue written notices requiring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment .
part 2 prohibits potentially harmful activities from taking place within the coastal buffer zone unless they have been specifically authorised and requires permits to be obtained before undertaking specified activities within this zone .
the authorisation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment .
the bill does not seek to introduce new environmental impact assessment procedures .
assessing the environmental impact of activities which may detrimentally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were promulgated in terms of nema on 21 april 2006 .
part 3 prohibits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit .
this part also provides strict guidelines for decision-making which the permit issuing authority must consider .
section 68 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for granting permits for the use of coastal resources while maintaining a high level of environmental protection .
this is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jointly by several organs of state instead of many separate authorisations .
part 4 deals with the letting of coastal public property by way of coastal leases and the granting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal concessions .
part 5 contains general provisions relating to the temporary occupation of land within the coastal zone for specified purposes and the amendment , suspension or cancellation of authorisations .
such amendment , suspension or cancellation is subject to the criteria specified in section 73 .
chapter 8 : marine and coastal pollution control
the bill intends to regulate the discharge of effluent into coastal waters from any source on land by requiring permits to authorise such discharges .
the bill also establishes a prohibition of incineration or dumping at sea of waste or other material .
this prohibition prohibits incineration at sea and restricts dumping at sea in accordance with south africas obligations under international law .
the bill provides procedures relating to both discharge and dumping permits .
the bill authorises the minister to dispense with prescribed procedure in respect of dumping in emergencies .
for example , vessels in distress due to mechanical failure may need to urgently dump cargo overboard .
the bill requires the minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .
chapter 9 : appeals
this chapter sets out the procedures to be followed when appealing against coastal protection or repair and removal notices or in connection with the granting or refusal of a permit under the act .
it empowers the minister or mec either to consider the appeal personally or to appoint an appeal panel to determine the appeal .
the purpose of a panel is to ensure that the consideration of an appeal is informed by technical expertise where this is required .
pending the determination of an appeal , the minister or mec may make an interim order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the act .
chapter 10 : enforcement
this chapter establishes certain offences , determines penalties in respect of offences , provides for offences under the act to be prosecuted in the magistrates court and gives the minister , an mec or a municipality the power to institute legal proceedings or take other measures in relation to coastal public property or the coastal environment .
chapter 11 : general ministerial powers and duties
this chapter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the minister and the mecs .
part 1 deals with the powers of the minister and of mecs to make regulations to promote the acts implementation and prescribes the consultative process that is to be followed when making regulations .
part 2 describes the powers to be exercised by the minister and mec .
section 92 grants the minister the power to exercise certain functions normally exercised by the mec if specific circumstances apply .
section 93 authorises the mec to issue directives to municipalities .
part 3 deals with delegations .
section 94 deals with delegations of powers or duties by the minister .
section 95 authorises the minister to exercise certain duties and powers normally exercised by the mec under certain circumstances .
section 96 deals with the mecs powers to delegate powers or duties assigned to the mec .
part 4 deals with certain general matters .
section 97 deals with information and reporting on coastal matters .
the minister must make certain information concerning the protection and management of the coastal zone available to the public .
the responsibilities of the minister and mecs to prepare reports on the state of the coastal environment are also set out .
section 98 requires the coordination of actions between provinces and municipalities .
chapter 12 miscellaneous matters
this chapter deals with a variety of matters in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the previous management system to the one proposed by the bill .
these include provisions dealing with the continuation of existing leases on , or rights to , coastal public property , the procedures for dealing with unlawful structures on coastal public property , and the continuation of existing lawful activities in the coastal buffer zone that were lawful before the commencement of the act but that after its commencement may only be conducted with a permit .
it also deals with other matters such as the repeal and amendment of other laws .
one of the benefits of the proposed act is that it will replace three existing acts completely and will repeal provisions in the nature conservation act , 1987 of the former ciskei and the environmental conservation decree , 1992 of the former transkei .
costs and benefits
the implementation of the act will involve some additional costs to organs of state within the national , provincial and local spheres of government .
these will be primarily related to the new function of preparing comprehensive coastal management programmes .
however these costs should be dwarfed by the benefits derived from improved allocation of coastal resources and streamlined management systems .
if enacted will the bill provide an adequate new integrated coastal management act ?
some questions to consider when submitting comments
support the new holistic coordinated and integrated coastal management approach that is central to the white paper ?
ensure that our coast will remain a valuable national asset ?
enhance the ability of each sphere of government to perform their existing coastal management functions and facilitate the further assignment of coastal management responsibilities where appropriate ?
avoid or minimise the establishment of new institutions as recommended by the white paper ?
facilitate the establishment of a range of public / private and other partnerships for the management of areas of the coastal zone based on the recognition that the great diversity of coastal land forms and circumstances that exist along our coast require correspondingly diverse management systems ?
provide a legal basis for applying the principles and achieving the goals and objectives set out in the white paper ?
enable the development of national , provincial and municipal coastal planning systems to regulate the development and use of the coast ?
ensure the protection of our coasts historical , cultural and ecological integrity ?
adjust public and private rights to own and use the coast to ensure that they do not conflict with the implementation of the policy in the white paper ?
promote equitable access to opportunities and benefits arising from the use of the coast ?
enhance public rights to use the seashore and balance these with corresponding duties ?
provide for the use of economic instruments , as recommended in the white paper , to support the achievement of the policy objectives ?
generally or specifically give adequate legal effect to the policy in the white paper ?
it is also important to be aware of the fact that this draft legislation has been prepared in the context of a wider environmental law reform programme being undertaken by the department of environmental affairs and tourism .
one of the objectives of the environmental law reform process is to establish an integrated and internally consistent system of environmental laws for south africa .
accordingly , the act has been drafted in a manner that will enable it to be implemented in conjunction with other environmental and land-use planning legislation .

drinking water quality in cape town
the quality of drinking water in cape town is of a high standard .
this is due to the fact that most of the water consumed in cape town is abstracted largely from unpolluted mountain catchments .
our scientific services department is equipped with some of the most sophisticated water testing instrumentation in the water industry .
this , plus a highly skilled and experienced group of scientists and technicians guarantees that the water which is supplied to the consumer is of acceptable quality .
the city of cape town is committed to providing quality tap water to its consumers .
every effort is made to meet the highest international standards for drinking water .
our scientific services department performs numerous tests on water samples which are taken from water treatment plants , service reservoirs and from various points within the distribution system .
these tests must meet the recommended guidelines which are laid down in the south african national standards for drinking water .
most frequently asked questions
how frequently does water get tested ?
quality of the water to consumers is monitored weekly throughout the year at various points at the treatment plants and within the distribution network in the cape metropolitan area .
is cape town water recycled ?
no , we do not drink recycled water but , we do recycle water for other uses such as industrial and irrigation purposes that do not require potable water .
why is my water sometimes white when i open the tap ?
this is a harmless phenomenon and it is caused by presence of air bubbles .
the bubbles are as a result of high pressure in the distribution pipes that transport water to your home .
allow the glass to stand for a while and air bubbles will escape .
why does my water taste and / or smell funny ?
a swimming pool smell is caused by chlorine which is added to your water to kill bacteria .
an earthy smell is caused by a harmless substance called geosmin .
geosmin is produced by small water plants called algae which may be present in rivers and dams at certain times of the year , e.g. summer .
is chlorine present in my water and why is it added ?
chlorine is a disinfectant and kills bacteria in water .
chlorine has been used as a disinfectant as far back as the late nineteenth century .
it has gained popularity throughout the world as an antibacterial agent .
the presence of chlorine in piped waters has prevented and wiped out waterborne diseases such as typhoid , cholera and dysentery in many parts of the world .
in south africa it is added to drinking water to ensure the prevention of bacterial re-growth in the holding water reservoirs and the network of pipes that transport water from treatment plants to your home .
the levels of chlorines are such that they are maintained from supply point right up to your home tap .
is it better to drink bottled water than tap water ?
there is no reason why people should drink bottled water in cape town .
some people may choose to drink bottled water due to health reasons or taste preference .
with no presence of disinfectant , water can be contaminated and bacteria can accumulate during storage .
this happens mostly after bottling and while water stands on the shop shelf .

the bylaws listed in schedule 3 , are hereby repealed .
the charges referred to in section 7 of the bylaw , are calculated as set out hereunder :
the charge is , subject to the succeeding provisions of this schedule , the amount obtained by applying the formula calculated in terms of item below .
vw viet / 1500 viet where
vw is the total volume , expressed in kilolitres , of wastewater discharged from the premises during the period concerned .
svc is the sewerage volumetric charge in terms of the sanitation tariff .
vie is the total volume , expressed in kilolitres , of industrial effluent discharged from the premises during the period concerned .
t is the cost , as determined by the council , of treating 1 kilolitre of wastewater .
cod is the chemical oxygen demand of the effluent in milligrams per litre .
in the event of the cod being less than 1 000 , the cod factor falls away .
l is the limit applicable to that particular parameter .
no factor calculated by this formula may have a value less than zero ;
in the case of the ph parameter x represents the ph value and , if results in a negative value , a positive value of the same magnitude must be substituted .
the cod of industrial effluent is the rolling arithmetic average of four samples taken at any time during a six to twelve month period .
the sf of industrial effluent is the latest value determined .
the sf is cumulative for all parameters which are outside the limits set in schedule 2 .
if , for any reason , the requisite number of samples referred to in the items or above are not taken , or more than four samples are taken , council may determine an equitable cod and / or sf .
the owner / occupier of any premises is entitled to receive , on request , part of any sample taken from the premises before that sample is removed by council .
die raad het die reg om enige aangegewe parameters te gebruik of daarvan afstand te doen .
the council determines the total quantity of industrial effluent discharged from a premises .
if industrial effluent and other wastewater are measured together council will make such allowance as it considers fair for that other wastewater .
if a measuring device is proved to be defective , the council will , subject to item below , make due allowance for the defect in its calculation of the quantity of discharge .
the council may , by notice in writing , require the occupier , owner or person in control of , or using , any premises to provide such information , access or facilities council considers necessary either for the accurate calculation of the charge payable , or to establish whether a charge is in fact payable in respect of the premises .
if the council is of the opinion that the sampling does not represent the actual average quality of industrial effluent , then it may use an alternative acceptable method in order to determine an equitable industrial effluent charge .
measure separately the volume of water used for any specified purpose or in any specified portion of the premises , and provide proof to the satisfaction of the council that any gauge or device referred to in items 8 and 8 is functioning correctly and accurately .

State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2007 
Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ; 
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; 
Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament ; 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers ; 
Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary ; 
Heads of our Security Services ; 
Governor of the Reserve Bank ; 
President Nelson Mandela and Madame Graca Machel ; 
Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ; 
Mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
Our honoured traditional leaders ; 
Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; 
Directors-General and other leaders of the public service ; 
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners ; 
Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; 
People of South Africa : 
When she died , we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital . 
But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion . 
But that was not to be . 
Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains . 
Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year , we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband , the father of her children , her companion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , Oliver Reginald Tambo . 
Once more , we convey our condolences to the Tambo family . 
His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today . 
I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli , and the Order of the Companions of O.R . 
I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Orders . 
I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Womens March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the Presidents box , as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today . 
The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today , as I have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the General Elections of that year . 
At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month , the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections . 
Having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves ― what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 ! 
With your indulgence , I would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day , the 10th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic , whom our Parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections . 
On that occasion we said in part : 
For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society 
It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse . 
It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage 
It was a place in which squalor , the stench of poverty , the open sewers , the decaying rot , the milling crowds of wretchedness , the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse , assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets , and wooded lanes , and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass , and birds and houses fit for kings and queens , and lyrical music , and love . 
It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others , guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living , who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause . 
It was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls , electrified fences , guard dogs , police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters , with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters 
We have gathered here today , on Freedom Day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say ― an end to all that ! 
We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people , regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream 
None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty . 
The work to create that South Africa has begun . 
That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom . 
Fifty years before , as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People , which adopted the Freedom Charter , the patriots of the day had said , Let us speak together , all of us together ― African and European , Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom . 
And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
We must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action ― enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society ! 
We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa . 
Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream , our government committed itself , working with all South Africans , to implement detailed programmes intended : 
to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy ; 
to improve our export performance , focussing on services and manufactured goods ; 
to increase spending on scientific research and development ; 
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy ; 
to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment ; 
to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation ; 
to expand access to such services as water , electricity and sanitation ; 
to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole ; 
to intensify the housing programme ; 
to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture ; 
to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ; 
to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth , reconstruction and development of our country ; 
to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent ; 
increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world . 
At an average of over 4,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 . 
Investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8 . 
Today , fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product ― at about 18,4 ― is at its highest since 1991 . 
The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years . 
We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy . 
From owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; 
and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . 
Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low . 
The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us . 
The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ; 
and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery . 
But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs . 
While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations . 
The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries . 
Over the past three years , the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs . 
It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone , 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 . 
A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme . 
But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly . 
There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises . 
And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs . 
It is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage . 
While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004 , today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants . 
It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity . 
This will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities . 
The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years . 
However , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected . 
We must act to change this situation . 
As Honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport . 
These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started , the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system . 
These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , combining both road and rail . 
We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
Access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved . 
By 2005 , South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 . 
According to the United Nations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation . 
In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006 : 
South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy Rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid , partly through rights-based entitlements . 
We should indeed celebrate this great achievement . 
But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . 
Many more are without electricity and sanitation . 
We are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half . 
We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year . 
We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace . 
This applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates . 
The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement . 
At the same time , the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 . 
We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme . 
While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex . 
On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution . 
We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up . 
All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people . 
The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some defects in our systems in this regard . 
From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things : 
Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country ; 
Develop a proper database of households living in poverty ; 
Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ; 
Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty ; 
In this context , address all indigence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication ; 
Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored . 
This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market . 
In the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage . 
A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion . 
In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities , the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society , in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation . 
Further , on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers , we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together ! 
In other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . 
We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay , and work to attain the happiness that comes with it . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson ; 
I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime . 
In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said : 
Promoting peace and security will involve all people . 
It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected 
Peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
Certainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , closeted behind walls and barbed wire , ever anxious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces . 
Obviously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime . 
While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security . 
While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted . 
And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level . 
The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector . 
Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate . 
This applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel vetting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles , and so on . 
This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met . 
We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs . 
And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure , improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented . 
Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
As such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda . 
What has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants . 
Compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed . 
Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent . 
In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial . 
Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace . 
Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new . 
What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions . 
The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros . 
These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February . 
This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development . 
I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative , working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team , concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system . 
We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole . 
This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
In this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year : 
complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ; 
in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed , we will : 
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing , tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ; 
develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation , agriculture and agro-processing , the white goods sector , creative industries , community and social services and pharmaceuticals . 
This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a State Diamond Trader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers . 
We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ; 
With regard to communications , I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers . 
In addition , Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector . 
These centres will be established in areas identified by government . 
The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries . 
We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the Regulatory Impact Assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities . 
The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans . 
Starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions . 
At the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system . 
We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification . 
After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . 
In this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training institutes and others . 
As the Honourable Members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools . 
In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever . 
We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing . 
Quite clearly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy . 
Because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things : 
take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ; 
ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency , SEDA ; 
process the Companies Bill , adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday , as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ; 
having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings ; 
intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work , including a youth cooperatives programme , and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities ― and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , big and small , which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative ; 
start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers . 
Honourable Members ; 
The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society . 
For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society . 
A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa . 
This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people . 
The principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity . 
This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes . 
In the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include : 
continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system ; 
a wage subsidy for low-wage employees , possibly directed at first entrants into the job market , especially young people ; 
a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings , death , disability and unemployment benefits . 
The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech . 
What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC . 
In addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years . 
Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
Geen pogings om die openbare orde ter wille van selfsugtige eiebelang omver te werp , sal geduld word nie . 
ensuring the implementation , without further delay , of measures to reduce the cost of medicines ; 
continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of TB , road accidents and violent crime . 
In this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment . 
We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible . 
This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 . 
All these efforts , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security . 
In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented . 
The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies . 
Rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system . 
The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security . 
In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : 
bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution ; 
implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations ; 
utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service , in order massively to reduce case backlogs ; 
finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning , in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy ; 
implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections ; 
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ; 
improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating . 
In this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention . 
As we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals . 
In this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . 
Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums . 
Further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency . 
To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : 
strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres , including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system ; 
complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards , remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions ; 
intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres ; 
conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government ; 
roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational ; 
further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership . 
Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation . 
In this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 . 
As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . 
In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study , the National Income Dynamics Study . 
These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution . 
I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson : 
Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region . 
We are proud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba . 
We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development . 
However , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , Côte dIvoire and Somalia . 
Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia . 
Critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation . 
This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country . 
I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy . 
We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process . 
Similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes . 
Just over a month ago , South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . 
We hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . 
In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf . 
We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in India , Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as Japan , Europe and North America . 
One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations . 
We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition . 
Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ; 
Since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better . 
We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront . 
But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society . 
We should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom . 
We should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
We are not there yet . 
But no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . 
And so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share . 
Thank you . 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2007  
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008 
Mr Jacob Zuma , Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress ; 
Chairperson of SALGA , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ; 
Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year . 
I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all . 
I say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream . 
And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today . 
I speak here today in the presence of my mother , Epainette Mbeki , MaMofokeng , who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei , among whom she has lived for many decades . 
She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today . 
In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 92 years old . 
What she expects as her birthday present is the truth . 
I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her . 
I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year . 
We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman , representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include Nelson Mandela . 
We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner , the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago . 
We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , Robert Sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , banishment and other forms of repression . 
We acknowledge , both among the Honourable Members and our guests , the many founders of the United Democratic Front , 25 years ago . 
All these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans . 
Indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people . 
We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections . 
The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 . 
I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 . 
However , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . 
Happily , this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which , the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week . 
The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people . 
The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― Business Unusual !
We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later . 
To make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities . 
The main categories of these priorities are : 
the further acceleration of our economic growth and development 
speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals 
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy , and poverty eradication 
enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training 
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all 
revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime 
further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and , 
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations . 
More than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands ! 
As we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― Business Unusual ! 
As I was preparing this Address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow . 
He suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel , A Tale of Two Cities . 
And so I quote these words : 
It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . 
You will ask whether I agree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future ! 
My answer to this question is a definite No !
Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place . 
They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people . 
Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation . 
However , like all the Honourable Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow . 
They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity . 
They are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor . 
Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States . 
They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices . 
This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police , the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month . 
While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous South Africa . 
Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom . 
Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution . 
The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . 
This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges . 
And precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity ! 
In this regard , I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American , Cynthia Carroll , when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week , on Tuesday , February 5 . 
As the Honourable Members know , she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . 
And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil . 
Sure , the problems here are serious ; 
overcoming them will require ingenuity , especially in energy efficiency and energy saving , as well as the development of alternative power supplies . 
But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― I hope relatively unscathed This is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions . 
This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding . 
I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties . 
In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation . 
Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters . 
In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream . 
The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy . 
In this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin . 
As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge . 
Among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient . 
There are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take . 
These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another . 
Die Regering sal begin met die implementering van ’n veldtog om doeltreffende beligting te verseker , asook watervehitting deur middel van sonkrag , die beheer van die las van warmwatertoestelle in huishoudings , insluitend behuisingstandaarde vir alle nuwe huise en ontwikkelings . 
An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not . 
On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency . 
We are taking steps to enhance Eskoms maintenance capacity . 
We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects . 
All these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin . 
The massive Eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; 
and where possible , some projects will be accelerated . 
In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can . 
In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric during the course of last week , GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf . 
In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol , Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint . 
The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination . 
I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January . 
We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry . 
Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency . 
Task teams are currently working in many areas . 
Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country . 
They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings , Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency . 
The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises . 
The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme . 
We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period . 
This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end . 
However , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity . 
We are a minerals resource economy . 
We must therefore continue to support the mining industry . 
It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . 
However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient . 
Indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity . 
Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid . 
Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual ! 
This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today . 
I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully . 
Of course , I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament . 
The sense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !
We must ensure that we sustain this approach . 
We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud . 
I am certain that the South African Football Association , our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud . 
Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year . 
This must inspire Bafana Bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year . 
Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned . 
Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan . 
Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation . 
In this regard , R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy . 
Working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing . 
Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained . 
At the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability . 
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency . 
This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location . 
Cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right . 
Accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco . 
Already , money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation . 
Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables . 
At the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . 
Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year . 
Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of Business Unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes . 
An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development . 
Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition will be intensified . 
Indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills . 
In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates . 
Further , after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign . 
This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson 
At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all . 
In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme . 
Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . 
These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves . 
Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge . 
These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly . 
Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors . 
Among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment . 
Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 . 
But we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be . 
In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated . 
As such , in the spirit of Business Unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households . 
For this , we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency . 
Die oudit van grondeienaarskap sal ook bespoedig word . 
intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women , with emphasis on providing training and markets , including linking them up with established outlets ; 
scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the Military Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . 
R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme ; 
Die uitbreiding van die openbare werke-program , wat , deur die vasgestelde doelwitte te oortref , die potensiaal getoon het om meer nuwelinge te absorber . 
About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP ; 
introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small , medium and micro-enterprises ; 
and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed . 
We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services . 
Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS . 
We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment . 
We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners . 
As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation . 
Two such issues deserve brief mention . 
The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans . 
The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters . 
The second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose . 
We will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees . 
Madame Speaker and Chairperson , When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy . 
Accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality . 
In this regard , in the spirit of Business Unusual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system . 
Among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the Legal Aid Board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums . 
As the Honourable Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; 
but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime . 
The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week . 
Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the Criminal Justice System , we shall by the end of March this year , interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime . 
What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies . 
Of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements . 
If anything , the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants . 
There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
Firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging . 
The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision . 
Secondly , by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities . 
The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . 
Thirdly , recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by Cabinet . 
This includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card . 
Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management . 
Further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement . 
In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided . 
Working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National anticorruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . 
At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies . 
We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda . 
To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done . 
In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment . 
Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning . 
Thus , as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government . 
The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism . 
Our focus , in promoting the African Agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , Nepad . 
This we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels . 
A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration . 
We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard . 
It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union , within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible , premised on accelerating the development of our region . 
Over the past year , we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face . 
We had an opportunity , on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter . 
In short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address . 
These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years . 
The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments . 
What is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution . 
Accordingly , we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter . 
As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations . 
At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March . 
Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme . 
Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya , Chad , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia , the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability . 
We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments . 
We will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council . 
Critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union . 
Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums , the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement . 
In the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round . 
This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China . 
The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength . 
Next year , South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001 . 
We are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives . 
These global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup , bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity . 
But we should not take this for granted . 
I am confident that , under the leadership of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Investment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010 . 
What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course ! 
I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided . 
With all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels . 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2008  
State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town February 2009 
Madam Deputy President ; 
Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; 
Chief Justice Langa ; 
The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ; 
The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament ; 
Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ; 
Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament , Traditional leaders ; 
Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ; 
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society ; 
I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament . 
I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President . 
Mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running . 
That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers . 
As we look back over the past fifteen years , I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary ; 
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans . 
Above all , I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today ― worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life . 
These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation . 
Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell . 
They include Brian Bunting , Billy Nair , Ncumisa Kondlo , John Gomomo , Joe Nhlanhla , Cas Saloojee , John Schippers and Jan van Eck . 
To these , I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman , a truly distinguished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old . 
It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― our nation is in a good state . 
However , we should not underestimate the challenges we face . 
The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people . 
Naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers . 
As a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult . 
But ours is a journey of hope and resilience . 
Our democracy is healthy . 
It is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world . 
Indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy . 
It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress ; 
and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come . 
Allow me , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves . 
This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed . 
But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday , the 7th and 8th of February respectively . 
I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections . 
We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands . 
Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all . 
It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August , 1989 ― commonly known as the Harare Declaration . 
That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the United Nations , on the approach to negotiations in South Africa . 
Within South Africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life . 
All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 . 
In this regard , we should salute the late President of the African National Congress , Oliver Reginald Tambo , for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country . 
That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa . 
While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion . 
Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance . 
In this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom . 
Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu , brother of Kalushi , representing the Mahlangu family . 
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands . 
A hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts . 
In the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership . 
A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago . 
Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO , which included : Strini Moodley , Professor Barney Pityana , Steve Biko , Onkgopotse Tiro , Harry Nengwekhulu , Themba Sono , Mapetla Mohapi , Mosioua Lekota , Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi . 
For inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them . 
In this regard , we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiros cousin , Pat Tlhagwana . 
In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale , the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students , and his peers . 
In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth . 
The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ; 
that we should indeed , in the words of the Freedom Charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture ! 
We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ; 
We do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy . 
Over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance . 
We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them . 
Indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society . 
However , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves . 
At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections . 
We hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour ! 
Though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves . 
On both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind . 
Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm leadership . 
However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public . 
As Honourable Members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus . 
This is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines . 
The same challenges confront the private sector . 
I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole . 
It is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 . 
In the First Decade of Freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 . 
While the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward . 
These include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors . 
In this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product . Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 . 
This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure . 
It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ; 
and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability . 
The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact . 
It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner . 
Our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system . 
Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms . 
Yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations . 
Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports . 
Except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing . 
As such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries . 
It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth . 
And because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes . 
These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward . 
Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
Wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life . 
Thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations . 
Importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work . 
In this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . 
Of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy . 
Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment . 
This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda . 
In reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential . 
The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes . 
Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods . 
Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage . 
I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . 
We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage . 
To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Professor Servaas van der Berg : 
Firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century . 
The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards . 
Thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved . 
On a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe : 
The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years . 
Indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African and Coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants . 
While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million . 
This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant , which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 . 
As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate . 
This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality . 
With regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves . 
and sanitation . 
Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities . 
Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ; 
and malaria cases have massively declined . 
We are also heartened that research into HIV prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection . 
Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity . 
In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement . 
In education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ; 
At the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas . 
Of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society . 
In addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past . 
Ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive . 
Governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided . 
We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better . 
Overall , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes . 
But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change . 
Be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
On this we still have some way to go . 
The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans . 
Daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack . 
Within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern 
Of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined . 
All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this . 
But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime . 
This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime . 
It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
These are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address . 
Yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country . 
This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability . 
But let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nascent stages . 
We still have a long way to go . 
I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society . 
In this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly . 
Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ; 
and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns . 
It is a matter of proud record that , for instance , female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ; 
and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition . 
Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability . 
HIV impacts most severely on young women . 
Violence against women and children is much too high . 
All these are assignments for the coming period . 
Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ; 
There is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive . 
But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense . 
It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former President Nelson Mandela , in his biography , Long Walk to Freedom : 
I have walked that long road to freedom . 
I have made missteps along the way . 
But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . 
I have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance I have come . 
But I can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and I dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended . 
In a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy . 
While our approaches may differ , the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our Constitution : to create a united , nonracial , nonsexist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world . 
Six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 . 
addressing the investment challenge by improving savings , appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds , housing , financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment ; 
die bevordering van gelykheid , die ontwikkeling van vaardighede , die skep van ekonomiese geleenthede en die uitbreiding van dienste , 
I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
to provide efficient , decent and equitable health care ; 
and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption . 
I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society . 
Rather , I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of visions . 
Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals . 
And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village . 
What , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade . 
We can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis . 
We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems . 
Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society . 
What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis . 
But we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ; 
access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse ; 
lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production ; 
the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality . 
These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high . 
Combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects . 
As such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation . 
We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries . 
Indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate . 
In this regard , Honourable Members , I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society . 
Firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years . 
In this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds . 
This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds . 
Secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes . 
On the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue . 
On the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme . 
Thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants . 
On its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis . 
Alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing . 
This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports . 
Fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men . 
In addition , we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits . 
We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations . 
In this regard , we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book . 
We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population . 
These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy . 
However , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable . 
This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better . 
Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation . 
Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe . 
Critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down . 
In our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path . 
The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat . 
But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later . 
In this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance . 
I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now . 
Virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion ― from stadia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans ― confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament . 
And we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations ! 
But beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity ― to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world . 
We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africas pursuit of excellence over the past year . 
Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings . 
We are of course Rugby World Champions ; 
Giniel de Villiers and his team have won the Dakar Rally ; 
our Paralympians continue to do us proud ; 
and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment . 
Just two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu . 
This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africas wealth . 
This initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition . 
Indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century . 
It is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country . 
We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face . 
We are truly heartened that , yesterday , the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government . 
Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator , former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion . 
In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country . 
We are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail . 
We are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable . 
The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ; 
but , hopefully , also with regard to political dialogue . 
In the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia and elsewhere . 
As would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months , South Africa will use the privilege of chairing SADC to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion . 
te versterk eerder as te verswak . 
We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity . 
We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China . 
Over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership . 
We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA ; 
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia , and countries in Asia , the Middle East , as well as Latin and North America . 
We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular . 
The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description . 
There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery . 
And we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories . 
Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development . 
We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership ; 
and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region . 
We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-EU Summit later this year . 
Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner . 
We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world . 
Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ; 
and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays . 
In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate . 
As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action , we will pay particular attention to : 
creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government , including national strategic planning ; 
continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way ; 
implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country ; 
continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health Insurance ; 
intensifying the campaign to save energy , so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour , while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources ― recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change , resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing ; 
integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ; 
intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system , including better forensic capacity , rapid increase in the number of detectives , optimal utilisation of information and communications technology , and better management of the courts ; 
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy , preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency ; 
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Childrens Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60 . 
These and other programmes , including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February , form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future . 
We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us . 
This , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state . 
It is steadily growing stronger . 
And so , in the words of former President Mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended . 
I thank you . 
Issued by : The Presidency February 2009  
state of the nation address of the president of south africa , thabo mbeki : joint sitting of parliament february 2007 
madam speaker of the national assembly ; 
chairperson of the national council of provinces ; 
honourable leaders of our political parties and honourable members of parliament ; 
ministers and deputy ministers ; 
our esteemed chief justice and members of the judiciary ; 
heads of our security services ; 
governor of the reserve bank ; 
president nelson mandela and madame graca machel ; 
distinguished premiers and speakers of our provinces ; 
mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
our honoured traditional leaders ; 
heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; 
directors-general and other leaders of the public service ; 
your excellencies , ambassadors and high commissioners ; 
distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; 
people of south africa : 
when she died , we knew that mama adelaide tambo had been recently discharged from hospital . 
but because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion . 
but that was not to be . 
tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains . 
thus she will only be with us in spirit when in october this year , we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband , the father of her children , her companion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , oliver reginald tambo . 
once more , we convey our condolences to the tambo family . 
his death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today . 
i feel immensely proud that democratic south africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what albert luthuli and oliver tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our national orders after them - the order of luthuli , and the order of the companions of o.r . 
i also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent national orders . 
i am also pleased to welcome to the house the activists of the 1956 womens march and the 1976 soweto uprising who are sitting in the presidents box , as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our provincial speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today . 
the government of the people of south africa on whose behalf i speak here today , as i have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the general elections of that year . 
at its annual january lekgotla or bosberaad last month , the national cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections . 
having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves ― what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 ! 
with your indulgence , i would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , convened at our seat of government the union buildings in tshwane on freedom day , the 10th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the inauguration of the president of the republic , whom our parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections . 
on that occasion we said in part : 
for too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society 
it was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse . 
it was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage 
it was a place in which squalor , the stench of poverty , the open sewers , the decaying rot , the milling crowds of wretchedness , the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse , assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets , and wooded lanes , and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass , and birds and houses fit for kings and queens , and lyrical music , and love . 
it was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others , guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living , who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause . 
it was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls , electrified fences , guard dogs , police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters , with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters 
we have gathered here today , on freedom day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say ― an end to all that ! 
we are greatly encouraged that our general elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people , regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream 
none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty . 
the work to create that south africa has begun . 
that work will continue during our second decade of freedom . 
fifty years before , as they prepared to convene the congress of the people , which adopted the freedom charter , the patriots of the day had said , let us speak together , all of us together ― african and european , indian and coloured all the people of south africa let us speak together of freedom . 
and of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
we must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action ― enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society ! 
we must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new south africa . 
responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the south africa defined by a common dream , our government committed itself , working with all south africans , to implement detailed programmes intended : 
to raise the rate of investment in the first economy ; 
to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the second economy ; 
to accelerate the process of renewal of the african continent ; 
at an average of over 4,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 . 
investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8 . 
today , fixed investment as a percentage of gross domestic product ― at about 18,4 ― is at its highest since 1991 . 
the number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years . 
we have seen steady progress in the advancement of black people in the economy . 
from owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the jse in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; 
and the proportion of blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . 
yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low . 
the advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us . 
the massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ; 
but our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs . 
while household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that south africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations . 
the continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries . 
over the past three years , the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs . 
it is encouraging that in the year march 2005 to march 2006 alone , 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 . 
a small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the expanded public works programme . 
but there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly . 
there is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises . 
and given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the national youth service and the development of young entrepreneurs . 
it is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage . 
while beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004 , today 11 million poor south africans have access to these grants . 
it is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity . 
this will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities . 
the housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years . 
however , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected . 
we must act to change this situation . 
as honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport . 
these include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the moloto rail corridor in mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started , the klipfontein corridor in cape town and the gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system . 
these and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , combining both road and rail . 
we will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . 
access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved . 
by 2005 , south africa had already achieved the millennium development goal in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 . 
according to the united nations development programme , south africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation . 
in the words of the undp human development report of 2006 : 
south africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid , partly through rights-based entitlements . 
we should indeed celebrate this great achievement . 
but it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . 
many more are without electricity and sanitation . 
we are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half . 
we are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year . 
we will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
an examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace . 
this applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates . 
the fluctuating matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement . 
at the same time , the number of matric students who pass mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 . 
we also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the adult basic education programme . 
while the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex . 
on the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution . 
we will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up . 
all these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people . 
the work done during the course of last year , by women through the south african women in dialogue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as tunisia and chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some defects in our systems in this regard . 
from the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things : 
define clearly the poverty matrix of our country ; 
develop a proper database of households living in poverty ; 
identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ; 
monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty ; 
in this context , address all indigence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; 
co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication ; 
accelerate the training of family social workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored . 
this will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market . 
in the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage . 
a critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all south africans to improve social cohesion . 
in this year of the 60th anniversary of the doctors pact of leaders of african and indian communities , the 30th anniversary of the murder of steve biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to dakar by afrikaner intellectuals to meet the anc , the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to south africa needs to be better canvassed across society , in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation . 
further , on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of the world and the weekend world newspapers , we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together ! 
in other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . 
we must together as south africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay , and work to attain the happiness that comes with it . 
madame speaker and chairperson ; 
i am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime . 
in the 1994 rdp white paper we said : 
promoting peace and security will involve all people . 
it will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected 
peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . 
certainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , closeted behind walls and barbed wire , ever anxious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces . 
obviously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime . 
while we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the south african police service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security . 
while we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted . 
and the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level . 
the increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector . 
quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate . 
this applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel vetting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles , and so on . 
this is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met . 
we will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs . 
and we will ensure that decisions to expand the correctional services infrastructure , improve the management of border control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented . 
many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . 
as such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda . 
what has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the sa management development institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants . 
compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed . 
obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent . 
in this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial . 
programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace . 
immediately after the march 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new . 
what is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions . 
the programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros . 
these pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year . 
it is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their growth and development summits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of february . 
this will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development . 
i would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to deputy president phumzile mlambo-ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the accelerated and shared growth initiative , working with the ministers and premiers who constitute the task team , concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system . 
we highly appreciate the contribution of all members of the executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole . 
this is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . 
in this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of asgisa , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year : 
complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the exchange rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ; 
in line with the national industrial policy framework which has now been completed , we will : 
intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in business process outsourcing , tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ; 
this must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . 
with regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a state diamond trader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers . 
we are happy that debeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ; 
with regard to communications , i am pleased to announce that the department of communications together with the mobile telephone companies and telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers . 
in addition , telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the bpo sector . 
these centres will be established in areas identified by government . 
the special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries . 
we will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the regulatory impact assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities . 
the progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of further education and training colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans . 
starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions . 
at the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the fet system . 
we do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification . 
after intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . 
in this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the joint initiative on skills acquisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training institutes and others . 
as the honourable members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools . 
in carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 fifa world cup is the best ever . 
we wish in this regard to congratulate our local organising committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing . 
quite clearly , in order to ensure that all south africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the second economy . 
because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things : 
take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the apex fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ; 
ensure the proper functioning of the small enterprises development agency , seda ; 
process the companies bill , adopted for public comment by cabinet last wednesday , as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ; 
having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the national youth service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the expanded public works programme in the maintenance of government buildings ; 
start implementing the communal land rights act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers . 
honourable members ; 
the economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of south africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society . 
for us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society . 
a critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 report of the committee of inquiry into a comprehensive system of social security in south africa . 
this is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people . 
the principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity . 
this will mean that all south africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes . 
in the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include : 
the minister of finance will further elaborate on these issues in the budget speech . 
what we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through nedlac . 
in addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years . 
our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : 
geen pogings om die openbare orde ter wille van selfsugtige eiebelang omver te werp , sal geduld word nie . 
continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of tb , road accidents and violent crime . 
in this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against hiv and aids and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment . 
we shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against aids and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible . 
this year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 . 
all these efforts , madame speaker and chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security . 
in this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented . 
the challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies . 
rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system . 
the overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security . 
in addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : 
bring the operations of the department of home affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the task team that has been working with the minister to improve the work of this vital institution ; 
implement the recommendations of the khampepe commission on the mandate and operations of the directorate of special operations ; 
implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the white paper on corrections ; 
continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our constitution and laws ; 
in this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention . 
as we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals . 
in this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . 
government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens . 
i should mention in this regard that the ministry of safety and security and the police service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important community police forums . 
further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency . 
to achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : 
conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in provincial departments responsible for local government , as well as the offices of the premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; 
roll out the batho pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose community centres beyond the 90 currently operational ; 
improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation . 
in this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 . 
as of two days ago 6 000 field workers from statistics south africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a community survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . 
in october another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in south africas first national panel study , the national income dynamics study . 
these 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution . 
i wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings . 
madame speaker and chairperson : 
among the greatest achievements of the peoples of africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the great lakes region . 
we are proud , as south africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our national defence force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the african dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of patrice lumumba . 
we will continue to work with the sister people of the drc , as well as burundi , the comoros and sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development . 
however , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in sudan , including the situation in darfur , côte divoire and somalia . 
our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the african union for assistance to the people and government of somalia . 
critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation . 
this year the african peer review forum will complete its review of our country . 
i wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy . 
we will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process . 
similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the nepad programmes . 
just over a month ago , south africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the united nations security council . 
we hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of south africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . 
in this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of palestine , israel , iraq , iran and other countries in the middle east and the persian gulf . 
we shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in india , brazil and the peoples republic of china , other countries of the south , as well as japan , europe and north america . 
one of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the doha development round of wto negotiations . 
we are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition . 
madame speaker , chairperson and honourable members ; 
since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing south africa for the better . 
we should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront . 
but the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society . 
we should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom . 
we should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . 
we are not there yet . 
but no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . 
and so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the south africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share . 
thank you . 
issued by : the presidency february 2007  
state of the nation address of the president of south africa , thabo mbeki : joint sitting of parliament february 2008 
mr jacob zuma , former deputy president of the republic and president of the african national congress ; 
chairperson of salga , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; 
chairperson of the national house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ; 
allow me on this occasion of the penultimate joint sitting of the third parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the honourable members of parliament a happy and productive new year . 
i am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all . 
i say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream . 
and such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today . 
i speak here today in the presence of my mother , epainette mbeki , mamofokeng , who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the transkei , among whom she has lived for many decades . 
she says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today . 
in eight days time , on february 16 , she will be 92 years old . 
what she expects as her birthday present is the truth . 
i thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her . 
i would also like to take this opportunity to salute president nelson mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 july this year . 
we welcome to this occasion mr arthur margeman , representing the veterans of the alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include nelson mandela . 
we are also privileged to have among us ms jann turner , the daughter of rick turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago . 
we are also pleased that we have among us mr dinilesizwe sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , robert sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , banishment and other forms of repression . 
we acknowledge , both among the honourable members and our guests , the many founders of the united democratic front , 25 years ago . 
all these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all south africans . 
indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people . 
we are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections . 
the government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 . 
i am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 . 
however , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . 
happily , this state of the nation address has given me the possibility to report to parliament and the nation on our 24 apex priorities which , the hon members can find on the government website during the course of next week . 
the identification of the apex priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people . 
the entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― business unusual !
we speak of business unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later . 
to make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the annual budget the minister of finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the apex priorities . 
the main categories of these priorities are : 
improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the second economy , and poverty eradication 
enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some african issues and south-south relations . 
more than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands ! 
as we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― business unusual ! 
as i was preparing this address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow . 
he suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , i should recall the well-known words with which charles dickens opened his novel , a tale of two cities . 
and so i quote these words : 
it was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of light , it was the season of darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to heaven , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . 
you will ask whether i agree with this assessment , whether i too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future ! 
my answer to this question is a definite no !
like the rest of our government i am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place . 
they continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people . 
thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation . 
however , like all the honourable members , i am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow . 
they are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity . 
they are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor . 
some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the united states . 
they are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices . 
this is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the national commissioner of police , the suspension of the national director of public prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . 
they are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in tshwane last month . 
while they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous south africa . 
most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom . 
let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the south africa visualised in our constitution . 
the national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . 
this must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges . 
and precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity ! 
in this regard , i would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the chief executive of anglo american , cynthia carroll , when she addressed the mining indaba here in cape town earlier this week , on tuesday , february 5 . 
as the honourable members know , she said : i dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . 
and south africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in chile and brazil . 
sure , the problems here are serious ; 
but if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― i hope relatively unscathed this is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions . 
this having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the government and eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding . 
i would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties . 
in the past two weeks , the ministers of minerals and energy and public enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation . 
last week the honourable members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters . 
in essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream . 
the resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy . 
in this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin . 
as government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge . 
among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient . 
there are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take . 
these are being disseminated by the department of minerals and energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another . 
die regering sal begin met die implementering van ’n veldtog om doeltreffende beligting te verseker , asook watervehitting deur middel van sonkrag , die beheer van die las van warmwatertoestelle in huishoudings , insluitend behuisingstandaarde vir alle nuwe huise en ontwikkelings . 
an instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not . 
on the supply side eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency . 
we are taking steps to enhance eskoms maintenance capacity . 
we have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects . 
all these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin . 
the massive eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; 
in this regard , i would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can . 
in a meeting with the chairman of general electric during the course of last week , ge offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf . 
in south africa our own large companies such as sasol , anglo and bhp billiton are all in concrete discussions with the departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint . 
the approach is one of common action rather than recrimination . 
i particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of january . 
we will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry . 
collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency . 
task teams are currently working in many areas . 
next week the provincial premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country . 
they will be supported by technical teams from edi holdings , eskom and the national energy efficiency agency . 
the department of provincial and local government will coordinate this activity supported by the line departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises . 
the minister of finance will provide more information in the budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to eskom in its build programme . 
we face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period . 
this situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end . 
however , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity . 
we are a minerals resource economy . 
we must therefore continue to support the mining industry . 
it is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . 
however it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient . 
indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity . 
let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid . 
let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for business unusual ! 
this is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the fifa confederations cup in 2009 and the 2010 fifa soccer world cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today . 
i mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully . 
of course , i have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to fifa and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever fifa soccer world cup tournament . 
the sense that we get , across all sectors of south african society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - business unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !
we must ensure that we sustain this approach . 
we are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong south african team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud . 
i am certain that the south african football association , our coaches led by carlos alberto parreira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and africa should be proud . 
once more we thank the springboks for showing the way when they won the rugby world cup last year . 
this must inspire bafana bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the beijing olympic games later this year . 
let me now turn to the apex priorities i mentioned . 
further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the industrial policy action plan . 
government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation . 
in this regard , r2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further r5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy . 
working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing . 
once more i would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the motor industry development programme is maintained . 
at the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability . 
to speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency . 
this entails coordinating the programmes of the state-owned enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location . 
cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right . 
accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of infraco . 
already , money has been allocated for sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation . 
working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables . 
at the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . 
attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in south africa of set top boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year . 
having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of business unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes . 
an element of governments apex of priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development . 
work to review the national human resource development strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the joint initiative on priority skills acquisition will be intensified . 
indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the ceos of 70 of the jse-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills . 
in addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates . 
further , after correcting weaknesses in our adult basic education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the kha ri gude mass literacy campaign . 
this will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 . 
madame speaker and chairperson 
at the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all south africans , acting as an important weapon in our war on poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all . 
in the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , and an agreement has been reached with the south african local government association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme . 
along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the land use management bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . 
these are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves . 
yet another critical apex priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge . 
these include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly . 
among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors . 
among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment . 
parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 . 
but we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be . 
in any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated . 
as such , in the spirit of business unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households . 
for this , we will require a national war room for a war against poverty bringing together departments such as social development , provincial and local government , trade and industry , agriculture and land affairs , public works and health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency . 
die oudit van grondeienaarskap sal ook bespoedig word . 
scaling up the national youth service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the military skills development programme of the south african national defence force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . 
r700 million has already been given to the sandf to start scaling up this programme ; 
die uitbreiding van die openbare werke-program , wat , deur die vasgestelde doelwitte te oortref , die potensiaal getoon het om meer nuwelinge te absorber . 
about r1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the epwp ; 
and through the small enterprises development agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed . 
we will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services . 
accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the national strategic plan against hiv and aids . 
we also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant tb patients receive treatment . 
we aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners . 
as we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for business unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation . 
two such issues deserve brief mention . 
the first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , as well as a youth pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all south africans . 
the minister of education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters . 
the second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose . 
we will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the south african geographical names council and its provincial committees . 
madame speaker and chairperson , when we reflected on the issue of crime at last years joint sitting of parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy . 
accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality . 
in this regard , in the spirit of business unusual , cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system . 
among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the legal aid board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the community police forums . 
as the honourable members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; 
the ministers of the justice , crime prevention and security cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week . 
informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the khampepe judicial commission on the functioning and location of the directorate of special operations and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the criminal justice system , we shall by the end of march this year , interact with parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime . 
what will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies . 
of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements . 
if anything , the spirit of business unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants . 
there are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . 
firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging . 
the department of public service and administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision . 
secondly , by may of every year all senior managers should have filed their key performance agreements with relevant authorities . 
the office of the public service commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . 
thirdly , recognising that the department of home affairs touches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by cabinet . 
this includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new id card . 
improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management . 
further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement . 
in this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a public sector summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of batho pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided . 
working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second national anticorruption programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . 
at local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies . 
we shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year local government strategic agenda . 
to ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , salga has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done . 
in order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment . 
many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning . 
thus , as part of our apex priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government . 
the programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the african peer review mechanism . 
our focus , in promoting the african agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the african institutions , including the african union and its development programme , nepad . 
this we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels . 
a critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration . 
we continue to be committed to a free trade area in the southern african development community , and hope to use our chairpersonship of sadc in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard . 
it is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the european union , within the context of the process led by the african union , to ensure that the negotiations on the economic partnership agreement are completed as soon as possible , premised on accelerating the development of our region . 
over the past year , we carried out the mandate of sadc to assist the political leadership of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face . 
we had an opportunity , on the fringes of the au summit in addis ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of sadc on this matter . 
in short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address . 
these include issues relating to the constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years . 
the relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments . 
what is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed draft constitution . 
accordingly , we join the sadc heads of state and government in congratulating the parties to the zimbabwe dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter . 
as requested by the sadc heads of state and government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the zimbabwe negotiations . 
at the same time , we wish the people of zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of march . 
our multifaceted relations with the democratic republic of congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme . 
our government will remain seized of the processes under way in kenya , chad , burundi , darfur in the sudan , western sahara , côte divoire , somalia , the comoros and the central african republic to find lasting peace and stability . 
we call on all african compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments . 
we will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the united nations security council . 
critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the un security council and the peace and security council of the african union . 
impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the india-brazil-south africa forums , the new africa-asia strategic partnership , the non-aligned movement , the group of 77 and negotiations to complete the sacu-mercusor trade agreement . 
in the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the kyoto protocol on climate change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the wto doha development round . 
this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between south africa and the peoples republic of china . 
the mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the china-south africa partnership for growth and development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength . 
next year , south africa will play host to the review conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the world conference against racism which was held in our country in 2001 . 
we are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the review conference achieves its objectives . 
these global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 fifa soccer world cup , bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity . 
but we should not take this for granted . 
i am confident that , under the leadership of the international marketing council , trade and investment south africa , tourism south africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of business unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate africas humanity in 2010 . 
what i do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course ! 
i say this with unshakeable conviction because i am certain that south africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided . 
with all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels . 
issued by : the presidency february 2008  
state of the nation address of the president of south africa , kgalema motlanthe , to the joint sitting of parliament , cape town february 2009 
madam deputy president ; 
deputy speaker and deputy chairperson of the national council of provinces ; 
chief justice langa ; 
the former deputy president of the republic of south africa and president of the anc ; 
the former chief justice and former presiding officers of parliament ; 
your excellencies , ambassadors and high commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ; 
honourable leaders of political parties and members of parliament , traditional leaders ; 
your worship the mayor of the city of cape town ; 
religious leaders and representatives of civil society ; 
i am privileged to address the joint sitting of the parliament of the republic of south africa , at the beginning of this last session of our third democratic parliament . 
i stand before the people of south africa with humility at the opportunity i have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former president . 
mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the national executive in completing the mandate accorded the african national congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running . 
that we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers . 
as we look back over the past fifteen years , i wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of presidents nelson mandela and thabo mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the judiciary ; 
driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all south africans . 
above all , i stand before you with pride and confidence that the south africa we celebrate today ― worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― is a product of the labours and toils of south african women and men from all walks of life . 
these south africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation . 
within the galaxy of outstanding south africans are members of our democratic parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last february to bid the final farewell . 
they include brian bunting , billy nair , ncumisa kondlo , john gomomo , joe nhlanhla , cas saloojee , john schippers and jan van eck . 
to these , i would also like to add ms helen suzman , a truly distinguished south african , who represented the values of our new parliament in the chambers of the old . 
it is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― our nation is in a good state . 
however , we should not underestimate the challenges we face . 
the global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people . 
naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers . 
as a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult . 
but ours is a journey of hope and resilience . 
our democracy is healthy . 
it is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a constitution hardly equalled in the world . 
indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy . 
it is south africas people who have ensured its progress ; 
allow me , madame speaker and chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible south africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves . 
this we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed . 
but we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the electoral commission of south africa tomorrow and sunday , the 7th and 8th of february respectively . 
i should also take this opportunity to indicate that i will in the next few days conclude consultations with the electoral commission and the provincial premiers and announce the date of the elections . 
we owe our being as a democracy to the people of south africa who , on 27 april 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands . 
through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all . 
it is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the declaration of the oau ad-hoc committee on southern africa on the question of south africa adopted in august , 1989 ― commonly known as the harare declaration . 
that initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the united nations , on the approach to negotiations in south africa . 
within south africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 conference for a democratic future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life . 
all this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 . 
in this regard , we should salute the late president of the african national congress , oliver reginald tambo , for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country . 
that courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the national convention which presaged the formation of the union of south africa . 
while that convention defined the territorial integrity of south africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion . 
those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance . 
in this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , solomon kalushi mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom . 
allow me to acknowledge lucas mahlangu , brother of kalushi , representing the mahlangu family . 
solomon mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under king cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the british army in isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands . 
a hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts . 
in the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership . 
a group of valiant students broke away from nusas to found the south african students organisation 40 years ago . 
within this generation are the early leaders of saso , which included : strini moodley , professor barney pityana , steve biko , onkgopotse tiro , harry nengwekhulu , themba sono , mapetla mohapi , mosioua lekota , johnny issel and mthuli ka shezi . 
for inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them . 
in this regard , we wish to acknowledge onkgopotse tiros cousin , pat tlhagwana . 
in this context we also wish to acknowledge the late ephraim mogale , the founding president 30 years ago of the congress of south african students , and his peers . 
in the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth . 
the message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ; 
that we should indeed , in the words of the freedom charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture ! 
we call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ; 
we do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the constitution to support democracy . 
over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance . 
we have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them . 
indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society . 
however , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves . 
at the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections . 
we hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour ! 
though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves . 
on both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind . 
various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , thusong service centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the department of home affairs , firm leadership . 
however , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public . 
as honourable members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus . 
this is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines . 
the same challenges confront the private sector . 
i am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole . 
it is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , south africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 . 
in the first decade of freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 . 
while the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward . 
these include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors . 
in this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of gross domestic product . such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 . 
this is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure . 
it is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ; 
the focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact . 
it is in this context that the accelerated and shared growth initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner . 
our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system . 
our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms . 
yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations . 
our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports . 
except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing . 
as such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries . 
it is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large current account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth . 
and because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes . 
these are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward . 
of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?
wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life . 
thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations . 
importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work . 
in this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . 
of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy . 
sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including broad-based black economic empowerment . 
this is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda . 
in reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential . 
the fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes . 
sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods . 
honourable members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage . 
i will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . 
we have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage . 
to quote work conducted by a team of academics at the university of stellenbosch , led by professor servaas van der berg : 
firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century . 
the reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards . 
thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved . 
on a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe : 
the prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years . 
indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among african and coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants . 
while the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million . 
this is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the child support grant , which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 . 
as part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the expanded public works programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate . 
this has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality . 
with regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves . 
evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities . 
child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ; 
we are also heartened that research into hiv prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection . 
yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity . 
in some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement . 
in education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ; 
at the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas . 
of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society . 
in addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past . 
ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive . 
governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided . 
we should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better . 
overall , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes . 
but we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change . 
be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !
on this we still have some way to go . 
the scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for south africans . 
daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack . 
within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern 
of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined . 
all kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this . 
but we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime . 
this points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime . 
it points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . 
these are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address . 
yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country . 
this is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability . 
but let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nascent stages . 
we still have a long way to go . 
i am certain that honourable members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society . 
in this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly . 
through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ; 
it is a matter of proud record that , for instance , female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ; 
yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability . 
hiv impacts most severely on young women . 
violence against women and children is much too high . 
all these are assignments for the coming period . 
madame speaker and honourable chairperson ; 
there is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive . 
but neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense . 
it is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former president nelson mandela , in his biography , long walk to freedom : 
i have walked that long road to freedom . 
i have made missteps along the way . 
but i have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . 
i have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance i have come . 
but i can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and i dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended . 
in a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy . 
while our approaches may differ , the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our constitution : to create a united , nonracial , nonsexist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world . 
six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a growth and development summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of south africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 . 
i am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives south africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ; 
i cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society . 
rather , i have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that south africa does not suffer the poverty of visions . 
our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . 
these ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the united nations millennium development goals . 
and yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village . 
what , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade . 
we can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis . 
we can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems . 
yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society . 
what we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis . 
but we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ; 
these difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high . 
combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects . 
as such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation . 
we know too that south africa is less severely affected than many other countries . 
indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , south africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate . 
in this regard , honourable members , i am happy to report that in the interactions between the presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society . 
firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to r690-billion for the next three years . 
in this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds . 
this will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds . 
secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes . 
on the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue . 
on the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the expanded public works programme . 
thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants . 
on its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis . 
alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing . 
this will be combined with promotion of the proudly south africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports . 
fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men . 
in addition , we will more widely utilise the social distress relief grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the unemployment insurance fund or who have exhausted their benefits . 
we shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations . 
in this regard , we wish to commend the competition commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book . 
we do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population . 
these immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy . 
however , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable . 
this also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better . 
our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation . 
both in the g20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe . 
critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the doha round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down . 
in our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path . 
the length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat . 
but we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later . 
in this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance . 
i refer here in particular to the fifa world cup in 2010 as well as the confederations cup a few months from now . 
virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion ― from stadia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans ― confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament . 
and we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations ! 
but beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase south african and african hospitality and humanity ― to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world . 
we also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted south africas pursuit of excellence over the past year . 
special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings . 
we are of course rugby world champions ; 
giniel de villiers and his team have won the dakar rally ; 
our paralympians continue to do us proud ; 
just two weeks ago , south africa completed with mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of timbuktu . 
this rich heritage points to africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for africas wealth . 
this initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition . 
indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the african century . 
it is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country . 
we wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face . 
we are truly heartened that , yesterday , the zimbabwean parliament passed amendment 19 of the constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government . 
special mention in this regard is due to sadc facilitator , former president thabo mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion . 
in this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country . 
we are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail . 
we are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the democratic republic of congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable . 
the partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the drc and rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ; 
in the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the african union to pursue these objectives in burundi , sudan , western sahara , côte divoire , somalia and elsewhere . 
as would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months , south africa will use the privilege of chairing sadc to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion . 
we will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity . 
we are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china . 
over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership . 
we also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with brazil and india through ibsa ; 
and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with russia , and countries in asia , the middle east , as well as latin and north america . 
we have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the middle east in general and in israel and palestine in particular . 
the depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description . 
there can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery . 
and we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so israelis and palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories . 
our special congratulations to the government and people of cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development . 
we were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the european union on our strategic partnership ; 
and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the economic partnership agreements with countries in our region . 
we look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the south africa-eu summit later this year . 
along with other countries of the south we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the united nations , the international monetary fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner . 
we also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the kyoto protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world . 
informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ; 
in the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate . 
as part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments programme of action , we will pay particular attention to : 
continuing with the war on poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the comprehensive anti-poverty strategy through the public consultations now under way ; 
continuing research and consultations on the comprehensive social security system , including the matter of national health insurance ; 
integrating into the work of the relevant clusters the findings of research on second economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ; 
and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the national youth policy , preparing for the implementation of the african youth charter once it has been processed by parliament , and for the setting up of the national youth development agency ; 
and extending the number of municipalities that have set up childrens rights focal points beyond the current 60 . 
these and other programmes , including the apex priorities identified in the state of the nation address last february , form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future . 
we will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the south african people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us . 
this , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state . 
it is steadily growing stronger . 
and so , in the words of former president mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended . 
i thank you .
