what is xenophobia ?
xenophobia is a fearful attitude or dislike of foreigners or strangers who are considered as not belonging to the local population .
it creates unfriendly relations and divisions that are based on us versus them attitudes .
myths and stereotypes about foreign nationals .
? : they are all criminals .
fact : the number of south africans who are alledged criminals is actually higher than that of foreign nationals .
migrants , asylum seekers and refugees are in fact at a greater risk of criminal attacks .
? : they are all here illegally .
fact : it is not true that all foreign nationals are residing illegally in the country because home affairs gives permission to foreigners who are in possession of legal documents to stay in the country .
any foreign national who is not in possession of a valid permit is returned to his or her country by the immigration services of home affairs .
? : they occupy rdp houses .
fact : some of the south africans facilitate corruption through the issuance of fraudulently obtained south african green id and lease of houses to foreign nationals .
areas and levels where xenophobia exists
xenophobia exists within :
communities .
employment sectors .
schools and institutions of higher learning .
how does xenophobia reveal itself in south africa ?
xenophobia is commonly expressed through :
violent attacks against asylum seekers , refugees , migrants or immigrants .
the rejection and undermining of different cultures , and religions of other nationalities .
the giving of denigrating and insulting names to people of other countries .
factors that contribute to the tensions between foreign nationals and local people .
competition to access health , education , social grants and other social services .
business rivalry .
employment competition .
lack of ubuntu ( the spirit of humanness ) .
how can these tensions be avoided ?
if south africans are unhappy about the levels of basic public service delivery , they must approach their elected representatives and hold them accountable .
attacking foreigners is not the solution to resolve problems of accessing basic public services such as housing , electricity , water , education and health .
foreign entrepreneurs and local businesses must be encouraged to establish mutual business cooperation or partnerships .
alert the local immigration services about employers who unlawfully employ foreigners who are not in possession of valid permits .
accept diversity and interact with foreign nationals .
recognise that foreigners boost our economy and add to our diversity .
why do people leave their countries and come to south africa ?
people come to south africa for various reasons :
asylum seekers and refugees seeking protection from the government of south africa because they fear persecution as a result of wars or political problems in their own countries .
tourists coming to visit different places of interest in the country and thereby boosting our tourism industry and creating jobs .
visitors who come to see friends or relatives .
persons who come for business or foreign investment purposes .
persons who come to work legally , such as mineworkers and professionals .
persons who come to conduct research and charity work .
students who come to the country to study .
why does the government accept foreign nationals in our country ?
south africa is engaged in international trade and it needs to cooperate with other countries for purposes of investment .
the government acceded to a number of international treaties and conventions that protect the rights of human beings , whether they are citizens , immigrants , migrants , asylum seekers or refugees .
are foreign nationals entitled to human rights ?
yes , every human being irrespective of nationality is entitled to have their basic human rights observed and protected .
people coming from other countries are entitled to human rights in the same way as south african nationals .
they are entitled :
to be treated equally before the law
to have their human dignity respected .
to work as long as they have a valid permit that allows them to do so .
to study as long as they have a valid permit .
students are only allowed to perform part time jobs .
to access public services such as health , education , and the justice system .
when is a person called a legal or an illegal immigrant ?
legal immigrants are in possession of valid south african documents or visas and are therefore staying legally in the country .
illegal immigrants either do not have valid visas or permits or they use fraudulent documents or their permits have expired .
what does the law say about illegal immigrants ?
illegal immigrants are returned or deported to their countries of origin but in a manner that respects their human dignity .
why do we have to challenge xenophobia ?
xenophobia is against humanity and the spirit of ubuntu .
it discourages integration .
it promotes violence .
it undermines democracy and the constitution .
it discourages diversity and development .
foreign nationals contribute to economic growth , especially in the professional , technical , mining , and tourism sectors .
who is responsible for fighting xenophobia ?
it is the duty of government , ordinary citizens , migrants , immigrants , asylum seekers or refugees to challenge xenophobia .
how do we report incidents of xenophobia ?
anyone is free to contact the counter xenophobia unit at home affairs on
tel : ( 012 ) 810 7141 / 7102 / 6107 or send a letter to this address : department of home affairs , private bag x114 pretoria 0001 or visit us at 270 maggs street corner petroleum street , waltloo , pretoria .

( e ) chemical abstracts service ( cas ) numbers :
in some instances chemicals are listed by name and cas number .
chemicals of the same structural formula ( including hydrates ) are controlled regardless of name or cas number .
cas numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular chemical or mixture is controlled , irrespective of nomenclature .
cas numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different cas numbers , and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different cas numbers .
for the purpose of this annex , the following definitions apply :
accuracy
usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , means the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .

design research
design analysis
design concepts
assembly and testing of prototypes
pilot production schemes
design data
process of transforming design data into a product
configuration design
integration design
in the public domain
this means software or technology which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination . ( copyright restrictions do not remove software or technology from being in the public domain . )
microcircuit

dear colleague
pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009
as the minister of health , i am personally writing to you regarding the above disease for two reasons :
to give you information that will assist you personally to deal with the disease
to request your assistance and personal involvement and that of your high office in effectively communicating key messages on influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009 within your community .
the official scientific name of this disease is pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009 .
it started in mexico and the united states of america in april this year .
it was initially known as swine flu because it was thought to have originated from pigs .
now , it is understood that it is a mixture of human and avian ( birds ) elements .
hence , the disease has nothing to do with the consumption of pork or pork products .
it is now simply referred to as pandemic influenza or preferably by its official name , a ( h1n1 ) 2009 .
since april this year , the virus has spread rapidly to 166 countries globally .
in africa , it has so far spread to only 16 countries .
at the time of writing this letter , the virus had affected 177 457 people ( laboratory confirmed ) globally with 1 457 confirmed deaths .
in south africa to date , we have confirmed 2 844 cases with six deaths .
after the fourth emergency committee meeting held on 11 june 2009 , the world health organisation ( who ) concluded that the criteria for a global pandemic had been met and the director-general , dr margaret chan , declared a pandemic ( phase 6 ) .
this simply means that the disease has spread to countries in all regions of the who and was spreading very fast .
however , i wish to emphasise that the declaration of a pandemic does not mean that the disease is virulent .
it simply means it is spreading all over .
on 6 july , the who described the spread of the pandemic within affected countries and to new countries as inevitable and unstoppable .
fortunately though , while this may be so , they noted that most people who contract the virus will have mild systems .
nevertheless , as health officials , globally and locally , we are still worried by the deaths that have so far occurred ( globally 0,8 and in south africa 0,2 of the affected people ) .
the virus mostly affects individuals in the age group 10 to 29 years ― most of these individuals are in schools or institutions of higher learning .
the who advised that countries must concentrate on mitigating the impact of the disease on communities .
in doing this , effective communication is the key .
mode of spread
the disease is spread by droplet infection i.e. when an infected person coughs or sneezes , and you inhale the air into which they have sneezed or coughed .
even if they cough onto a surface and you inhale the air around that you may get infected ) .
symptoms of the disease
the symptoms can be divided into three main categories
severe .
mild symptoms include :
runny or blocked nose
muscle aches and pain
general feeling of unwellness .
the overwhelming majority of people worldwide have mild symptoms and will not need any specialised medical care .
people with chronic heart or lung disease
diarrhoea and signs of dehydration .
severe symptoms include mild and moderate symptoms plus :
difficulty in breathing ( respiratory distress )
blue lips , tongue or other parts of the body
severe drowsiness and loss of consciousness .
anybody with moderate or severe symptoms must seek and receive urgent medical attention .
provincial spread of the disease
the spread of the disease within our provinces as a percentage of the total infections in our country is as follows :
the six deaths :
western cape three
eastern cape one
free state one
kwazulu-natal one .
testing for the virus
official testing is done by the national institute of communicable diseases , situated in gauteng and decentralised recently to the western cape .
testing will be done on recommendation by a doctor .
patients who seek care within the public health system should not be requesting a lab test .
we note that this is currently the case in the private health sector but this is not recommended by the who .
doctors should treat suspected cases in terms of protocols provided by the national department of health .
treatment
the treatment of choice is tamiflu .
this should be prescribed by a doctor and is only recommended for those with :
mild symptoms in the specialised risk categories as mentioned above
moderate symptoms
severe symptoms .
mass treatment with tamiflu will lead to mass resistance to the drug and render it useless even for those individuals for whom it may be life-saving .
closure of institutions
experience throughout the world has shown that closures of schools and institutions of higher learning , shopping malls and workplaces has not been effective in stemming the spread of the disease .
instead , it caused severe social disruptions .
we advise that any learner , educator or worker with mild symptoms should stay at home .
if there are many learners and / or educators staying away , then the affected institution should consult the department of education , which together with health authorities will advise on what course of action needs to be taken. forward .
simple hygiene
due to the mode of spread of the disease as mentioned earlier , the following simple hygiene is recommended :
wash hands with soap frequently
cough or sneeze into a tissue paper or your sleeve
never cough into your hands , rather cough into your elbow
if you are forced to cough into your hands , don 't touch anything like door handles , windows , table tops or utensils until you have washed your hands with soap
if you experience mild symptoms , stay at home and avoid contact with people .
i wish to assure you that everything is being done by scientists the world over working with the who to try and produce a vaccine .
if things go well , such a vaccine may be available within a few months .
however , there is likely to be overwhelming demand for the vaccine with limited production capacity ― none of the capacity being in africa .
i wish to thank you for taking time to read this letter to you , and also wish to thank you in anticipation of your active involvement in communicating and in mitigating the effects of the disease .
with kind regards
dr a motsoaledi , mp

2008 / 2009 financial year
the public service commission ( psc ) was established in terms of section 196 of the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 .
it is the only institution established in terms of chapter 10 of the constitution .
the constitution stipulates that there is a single psc for the republic of south africa , consisting of 14 members , five of which are appointed on the recommendation of the national assembly .
one member is appointed from each of the nine provinces , after nomination by the premier of the province on the recommendation of a committee of the provincial legislature .
the members are referred to as commissioners .
all commissioners are appointed by the president .
the five commissioners appointed on recommendation of the national assembly are based at the head office , while the remaining members are based in their respective provinces .
the procedure for the appointment of commissioners is governed by the public service commission act , 1997 , which provides for the regulation of the psc and matters connected with it .
according to the act , a commissioner is appointed for a term of five years , which is renewable for one additional term only .
the commission is headed by a chairperson appointed by the president from the nominated commissioners .
the psc is accountable to the national assembly and must report to it annually .
it must also report to the legislature of the province concerned on its activities in each province .
the president appointed the first members of the psc with effect from 1 january 1999 .
however , the commencement of formal operations by the psc was delayed until 1 july 1999 because of legal difficulties around certain aspects of the public service laws amendment act , 1997 .
the psc is supported by the office of the public service commission ( opsc ) , with its head office in pretoria and regional offices in each province .
the opsc is headed by the director-general , who is the accounting officer .
the staff of the opsc is appointed in terms of the public service act of 1994 .
vision
the public service commission is an independent and impartial body created by the constitution , 1996 , to enhance excellence in governance within the public service by promoting a professional and ethical environment and adding value to a public administration that is accountable , equitable , efficient , effective , corruption-free and responsive to the needs of the people of south africa .
mission
the public service commission aims to promote the constitutionally enshrined democratic principles and values of the public service by investigating , monitoring , evaluating , communicating and reporting on public administration .
through research processes , it will ensure the promotion of excellence in governance and the delivery of affordable and sustainable quality services .
the psc derives its mandate from sections 195 and 196 of the constitution , 1996 .
section 195 sets out the values and principles governing public administration , which should be promoted by the psc .
these values and principles are :
a. a high standard of professional ethics
b. efficient , economic and effective use of resources
c. a development-orientated public administration
d. provision of services in an impartial , fair and equitable way , without bias
e. responding to people 's needs and encouraging the public to participate in policy-
f. accountable public administration
g. fostering transparency
h. the cultivation of good human resource management and career-development
in terms of section 196 ( 4 ) of the constitution , 1996 , the functions and powers of the psc are :
to promote the values and principles , as set out in section 195 , throughout the public service
to investigate , monitor and evaluate the organisation , administration and personnel practices of the public service , in particular adherence to the values and principles set out in section 195 and the public service procedures
to propose measures to ensure effective and efficient performance within the public service

to report on its activities and the performance of its functions , including any findings it may make and directions and advice it may give ; and to provide an evaluation of the extent to which the values and principles set out in section 195 are complied with and
either of its own accord , or on receipt of any complaint ,
to investigate and evaluate the application of personnel and public administration practices and to report to the relevant executive authority and legislature

to monitor and investigate adherence to applicable procedures in the public service
to advise national and provincial organs of state regarding personnel practices in the public service , including those relating to the recruitment , appointment , transfer , discharge and other aspects of the careers of employees in the public service
the work of the psc is structured around six key performance areas , namely : leadership and human resource reviews , labour relations improvement , governance monitoring , service delivery and compliance evaluations , public administration investigations and professional ethics .
these areas are divided into the following line function branches :
a. branch : leadership and management practices enables the psc to promote sound public service leadership , human resource management , labour relations and labour practices

bsa was established in terms of the south african boxing act , 2001 ( act no . 11 of 2001 ) to control and regulate boxing in the republic ( promote boxing and to protect the interests of boxers and officials .
it considers applications for licences from all stakeholders in professional boxing , sanctioning fights , implementing the relevant regulations , and training boxers , promoters , ring officials , managers and trainers ) .
saids was established in terms of the south african institute for drug free sport act , 1997 ( act no . 14 of 1997 ) .
its main function is to promote participation in sport , free from the use of prohibited performance-enhancing substances , and to educate sportspersons on the harmful effects of doping .

request procedure
when is a request granted or refused :
a requester must be given access to a record of a public body if the requester complies with the following ―
the requester complies with all the procedural requirements in the act relating to the request for access to that record ; and
access to that record is not refused on any ground of refusal mentioned in the act .
how does one request access to a record :
a requester must use the form ( form a ) that was published in government gazette ( government notice r187 of 15 february 2002 ) .
the requester must also indicate if the requester wants a copy of the record or if the requester wants to come in and look at the record at the offices of the public body ( srsa ) .
alternatively , if the record is not a paper document , it can then be viewed in the requested form , where possible .
if a person asks for access in a particular form ( e.g. a paper copy , electronic copy , and so forth ) then the requester should get access in that form , unless doing so would interfere unreasonably with the running of the public body concerned ( srsa ) , or damage the record , or infringe a copyright not owned by the state .
if for practical reasons access cannot be given in the required form but in another form , then the fee must be calculated according to the way that the requester first asked for it .
if , in addition to a written reply to their request for the record , the requester wants to be told about the decision in any other way , e.g. telephone , this must be indicated .
if a requester is asking for the information on behalf of somebody else , the capacity in which the request is being made must be indicated .
if a requester is unable to read or write , or has a disability , then the request for the record can be made orally .
the information officer must then fill in the form on behalf of such a requester and give them a copy of the completed form .
there are two types of fees required to be paid in terms of the act , namely ; the request fee and the access fee ( for notification of the decision regarding granting of access ) .
a requester who seeks access to a record containing personal information about that requester is not required to pay the request fee .
every other requester must pay the request fee of r35 ( payable to public bodies ) .
the information officer must notify the requester ( other than a personal requester ) by notice , requiring the requester to pay the prescribed request fee ( if any ) and deposit ( if any ) before further processing the request .
the requester may lodge an internal appeal , where appropriate , or an application to the court against the tender or payment of the request fee .
after the information officer has made a decision on the request , the requester must be notified of such a decision in the way in which the requester wanted to be notified .
if the request is granted then a further access fee must be paid for the reproduction and for search and preparation for any time required in excess of stipulated hours to search and prepare the record for disclosure .
access to a record will be withheld until the requester has paid all the applicable fees .
services available to the public and how to access them
services
the clients of srsa have direct link with the department .
however , it is advisable that departments responsible for sport and recreation at provincial level be contacted for province-specific enquiries and services .
these provincial departments work closely and in a coordinated manner with srsa .
the services of srsa such as mass participation in sport at community and school level ; development and resourcing of sport clubs ; and provision of technical advice on provision of facilities for sport and recreation can be accessed through the provincial departments responsible for sport and recreation .
it should however be mentioned that the provision of facilities itself , is the responsibility of municipalities .
srsa contributes to this programme through the municipal infrastructure grant that is being managed by municipalities themselves .
however , certain information about srsa , for example , its products such as reports and other publications , can be obtained from the marketing & communication directorate through officials listed under item ' 6.2 ' below .

executive briefs
the sati executive held its latest meeting on 14 february 2009 .
below is a summary of the major items of discussion .
sati structure and 2009 elections
much of the discussion at the meeting revolved around the constitution and the structure of the institute going forward .
members will be notified in due course of the proposed amendments to the constitution , and a call for nominations to the executive and the committees for the next two years will be made shortly .
sati prize for outstanding translation
the categories and rules for the prize were finalised and the call for nominations in each of the categories will be sent out in march .
remember that the overall prize has been done away with and individual prizes will now be awarded in the following categories : literature , non-fiction , children 's literature , service translation and dic-tionaries .
members are encouraged to publicise the prize and the call for nominations among clients and other interested parties .
the awards ceremony will take place in september 2009 ( around international translation day ) .
bursaries
sati bursaries totalling r25 000 have been awarded to five students for the 2009 academic year .
members ' contributions to the development fund are being used to assist students who might not otherwise have been able to pursue translation studies .
it was agreed that from next year applications from first-year students would be accepted .
members are reminded that applications for bursaries for short courses may also be considered .
committees
the training committee is working on a survey to determine members ' needs for training , specifically with regard to translation-related short courses .
this will be sent out to members shortly .
the website committee reported that the full afrikaans version of the sati website should be up and running by mid-april .
translations into tswana and xhosa are also underway , but progressing more slowly .
members who work into the other official languages are urged to volunteer their services to help ensure that the website represents all the languages equally .
accreditation
the agreement that sati had with naati ( the australian national accreditation authority for translators and interpreters ) , which allowed for the accreditation of translators working in minor foreign languages , has unfortunately been terminated , owing to new manage
ment at naati and the prohibitive cost of the exams .
soccer world cup
members are reminded that there will be a special page on the sati website listing the contact details of interpreters offering their services for the world cup .
if you have not already submitted your details and you would like your name to appear on this page , please contact the sati office as soon as possible .
the next meeting of the executive will take place in june 2009 .
feedback from the last executive meeting
vol . 4 no . 1
february 2009
ix / 1 ( 2009 )
here we are , already starting the second month of the year .
we hope it will be a happy , healthy and prosperous year for all members .
together we can try to achieve more for our profession ― let us hear from you if you have any ideas about services the institute should be offering .
subs 2009
remember that subs for this year must be paid by the end of march .
invoices were sent out in december .
if you did not receive yours , please contact the sati office for a copy .
remember that corporate membership is available for agencies and offices .
thank-you to those members who have already paid .
please make sure that you inform the registrar of your payment .
tariff survey
the results of the latest tariff survey have now been put onto the sati website .
members are reminded that these are not official or recommended rates .
by law we may not prescribe rates .
all that we do is gather information on what is in practice being charged and make this information available .
we therefore request that members do not say sati recommends these rates .
members and others may use them as a check on their own rates , but should be aware that there will always be language practitioners who charge more or less than these rates .

post exposure prophylaxis
after a rape
information to help you take your treatment
what is pep
post exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) is the pills that are given to survivors of sexual assault and rape to reduce the risk of contracting hiv .
since it is difficult to establish the hiv status of the attackers , the survivors are treated as through the attackers are hiv positive .
this way we can be assured that all possible precautions are taken to reduce the chances of hiv infection being passed on .
why is testing for hiv important after rape .
testing for hiv is important because the pep is not necessary if the person is already hiv positive .
if you are hiv positive the staff at the clinic will provide you with information on how to live with hiv .
in most cases a hiv test is done before pep is started .
if the hiv test cannot be done immediately , the treatment should start anyway and the hiv test ca be done later .
when should the medication be started
medication must be taken within 72 hours after the attack , but preferably as soon as possible .
the medication is not effective if it is taken after this period .
for how long must the medication be taken ?
the medication must be taken for 28 days .
this helps to decrease the risk of becoming hiv positive .
the full course of 28days must be taken in order for it to work .
the pills
pills will be given to you to prevent things such as sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy .
the pep pills are however the ones that must be continued for 28days .
these pep pills must be taken twice a day .
most of the time , the clinic will not give you all the pills for 28 days , therefore you must return to collect the rest of the pills .
it is really important to come back to collect the rest of the pep pills to complete the course .
the clinic staff will give you a date on which to collect the pep pills .
it is bets to take the pills with food and it is recommended that you take the pills at approximately the same time every day .
for example , at 7am when you have breakfast and at 7pm when the news start .
many people use their cell phones to set up reminders .
this can be very helpful to you .
what about side effects .
most medicine has some side effects .
the pep pill is strong and may also have side effects .
the three most common side effects are nausea , running stomach and tiredness .
these become easier after the 2nd week .
you will be given anti-nausea medication for the first week .
it is also recommended that you take the pill with food .
if the side effects persist return to the clinic and inform the staff .
why is it important to take the medicine exactly as they are prescribed ?
taking the medicine at the right time and not missing any pills are important to ensure the effectiveness of the medicine .
developing a routine for 28 days is important .
we have developed a time table at the back of this pamphlet to assist you .
put it on your fridge or in the bathroom .
we are aware that this is a difficult time in your life with having to deal with sexual assault as well as having to take medicine to prevent possible hiv infection .
asking a family member or a friend to assist you during this period could also be helpful .
what do i do if i forget to take the medicine ?
it is important to take the pills daily for 28 days .
even over weekends and situations such as visiting friends etc. if you realize that you have missed a dose ; take it as soon as you remember , but if you only realize when taking the next dose , do not take double dose .
if you have forgotten to take the pills for two days or more speak to your clinic staff .
why must i return to the hospital / clinic ?
it is important that you must return to the clinic / hospital to collect the rest of the tablets and to have your hiv status checked .
at this visit they will give you the rest of the pep tablets and will also check how you are coping .
you should have another hiv test at 6 weeks ( 2nd return visit ) , after three months and after 6 months .
this is very important to find out your hiv status .
if you test negative each time it means that you did not contract hiv from the rape .
seeking help
rape is very traumatic .
here are some contact numbers :
national telephone numbers :
aids help line : 0800 012 4322
life line : 021 461 111
local numbers
the pill diary
here is an example of a pill diary .
this person started on a tuesday 12th november and she recorded this as day 1 and filled up her diary .
she also took her first pep pill in the morning and her second pill for the 1st day was at 7pm in the evening .
she will continue to take the pills at about the same time everyday for next 28 days until 9 december .
do the same for your pill diary .
it is important that you use condoms for six months .
your pep diary .
use this to help you remember to take the pills
fill in day 1 on the first day you start the pills .
tick off each time that you take the pill until 28 days of medication is complete .
keep the diary in a safe place .

To comply with the National Heritage Resources Act, anyone who wishes to modify historical structures must apply to Heritage Western Cape for permission.
A historical structure is defined as a building older than 60 years.
Heritage Western Cape issues a permit, based on the merits of the application and an environmental impact assessment.
This permit takes into account the development planning and zoning regulations of a local authority's Land Use Ordinance.
By ensuring that heritage matters are included in impact assessments for proposed developments, developers are able to identify heritage resources.
Thus developers will be able to proceed without uncertainty about whether work will be stopped if a heritage resource is discovered.
The permit system addresses a range of heritage resources:
* archaeological
* palaeontological sites and meteors
* architecture
* ethnographic and decorative art
* graves and burial grounds, including ancestral and royal graves, graves of traditional leaders, and graves of victims of conflict
* places of significant historical events, landscapes and natural features of cultural significance;
* living heritage associated with heritage and oral history, or scientific merit
* sites relating to the history of slavery in South Africa
* shipwrecks.
For further details see the South African Heritage Resource Agency's website: www.sahra.org.za.

The Western Cape Department of Health in conjunction with Crusaid, a UK based HIV/ Aids fundraising organization, is to launch the province's first dedicated Anti-Retroviral Treatment Centre in Gugulethu on Thursday 3 March 2005.
The 'Hannan Crusaid ARV Treatment Centre' stands out as a pioneering site for anti-retroviral treatment (ARV) in South Africa.
By the end of January 2005, the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health has 6 660 patients on anti-retroviral treatment at 31 sites across the province, exceeding the target set for the current financial year.
The anti-retroviral treatment (ARV) programme proposes a family approach to the provision of antiretroviral therapy to the community by building on the existing HIV care network.
It identifies suitable HIV infected individuals for ARV therapy as well as following up on their partners thus offering lifelong ARV therapy.
The programme's aim is to provide treatment for people infected with HIV and pregnant women referred from surrounding clinics and the Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU) in Gugulethu.
The centrally located center would thus function both as a treatment and a training center.
The Hannan Crusaid ARV Treatment Center represents the overall progress of ARV rollout in the Western Cape, says Pierre Uys, MEC for Health Western Cape.

UMTHOMBO WEENDABA City of Cape Town
The recent outbreak of avian botulism, commonly known as bird flu, in the Sonstraal and Vygeboom dams, which resulted in a moratorium on fishing in the dams being imposed, was the subject of a public meeting held in the Durbanville Council Chambers on Tuesday night, 8 March 2005.
Various officials from the City of Cape Town, as well as a representative from Cape Nature Conservation, were also in attendance.
Although the botulism appears to be currently under control, the general sentiment of the meeting was that fishing in the dams leads to unnecessary injury to the birds.
Birds have been strangled with fishing line, and even found with fish hooks in their beaks, are often encountered at these dams.
The meeting decided that the municipality be requested not to lift the moratorium on fishing, but to substitute it with a total prohibition on fishing in these dams.
The Directorate City Parks and Nature Conservation considered the request and due to the multitude of problems related to fishing, agreed to the imposition of a ban on fishing at these dams.
Therefore, no fishing is permitted at the dams and notice boards to this effect will be erected.
The presence of Law Enforcement will be increased at these dams to ensure compliance.

Provincial Government of the Western Cape Launches an e-Literacy Project
18 March 2005
SOURCE: E-Innovation (Department of the Premier, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
On 17 March 2005, the Cape Skills e-Literacy Pilot Project was initiated with the signing of an agreement between the provincial government and bridges.org, an NGO focusing on promoting the effective use of information and communications technology (ICT) in developing countries to improve people's lives.
"In its iKapa Elihlumayo strategy, the provincial government has committed itself to building human and social capital, with an emphasis on preparing the youth for employment.
With this e-literacy project, we are working to address this commitment in a very practical way," comments Dr Harold Wesso, the head of the Centre for e-Innovation, the provincial government unit in charge of this project.
e-Literacy looks at the combination of computer literacy and information literacy.
"This means that we aren't just looking at teaching people how to use computers; we're also teaching them how to use ICTs to access, generate and evaluate information and knowledge", says Katherine de Tolly, the project initiator.
"e-Literacy is important because we live in an age where people increasingly have to have these skills in order to be able to participate in the economy."
If e-literacy is not addressed, the digital divide is widened: those with access and skills benefit from technology and access to information, while those without are increasingly marginalised (e.g. excluded from jobs, and from participation in government processes and public discourse on the issues that affect their lives).
The Western Cape cannot afford to ignore the imperative to equip its citizens with e-literacy skills; it faces the threat of being left further behind in the global information society if it doesn't.
The Cape Skills e-Literacy Pilot Project will focus on developing training materials and doing training at various rural Internet access points in the Western Cape.
Based on lessons learnt from these initial training sessions, a strategy for a broad-based e-literacy across the province will be developed.
The training materials developed will be published as open content, which will mean that anyone can use and adapt them, be they NGOs, other governments, businesses or individuals.

* Who handles land development applications?
* How are applications decided?
* Appeals & queries
WHO HANDLES LAND DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS?
Local municipalities are responsible for handling development applications, such as applications for departures from building parameters or applications for rezoning or for the subdivision of land.
Municipalities decide how to handle these applications according to legislation, policies and guidelines provided by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning.
In a few instances, for example more complicated rezoning applications, the municipalities will refer applications to the Department for submission to the Minister for a final decision.
The Department processes agriculture-related applications for the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture, the national Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board.
The Department also processes mining-related applications for the national Department of Minerals and Energy, the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture, the national Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board.
HOW ARE APPLICATIONS DECIDED?
Before a development application can be decided in terms of land use planning legislation, the application must be subjected to various public participation processes and in some instances, the approval of various state institutions must also be obtained.
If an application falls within a certain category of land change it is also referred to the Department.
Applications are assessed in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act, 1989 to ensure that integrated environmental policy and planning considerations are addressed.
The Department ensures that these applications are coordinated with other related applications namely: mining reports, land development applications and spatial and strategic plans.
Once a development application has been reviewed in terms of environmental legislation, an authorization, permit or decision - whichever is appropriate - is issued.
Only after the application has been reviewed in terms of environmental legislation may a decision in terms of land use legislation be taken.
APPEALS & QUERIES
Once a decision has been taken by a municipality an appeal against the decision may be lodged with the Department for submission to the Minister.
If you have a query about a development application you've made, it must be directed to the body to which you made the application.

Visit to the Phelophepa Health Train by Health Minister Pierre Uys
22 March 2005
SOURCE: Ministry of Health (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
The "`best", "cleanest" and "healthiest" train to visit the Western Cape stops over at Malmesbury for four days to provide Dental, Health, Psychology, Eyecare and medicines to the first of thousands of people during a three month trek through the province.
The Phelophepa health care train, a hybrid name derived from Sotho and Tswana idioms meaning "good, clean health" is at Malmesbury station to provide services from the 22nd of March.
Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, will visit the train at Malmesbury on the Tuesday, from 8 to 10am.
"I believe the Phelophepa Health Care train is a brilliant concept of the Transnet Foundation and an excellent community outreach project.
It has been running since 1994 and has treated nearly 800 000 patients of whom 700 000 were children (in the Western Cape alone some 125 000 have been served) - an average of some 75 000 patients every year.
He said organisations such as the Colgate Palmolive Foundation and Roche Products which sponsor the train's dental and health clinics, was another good example of government partnerships with the private sector.
The services have been extended to include mother and baby-care, blood pressure tests, diabetic screening and cancer education and includes a pharmacy.
The dental clinic has six dental chairs equipped to perform the cleaning and extraction of teeth.
Three of the six chairs are also fully equipped to do restoration while a special X-ray unit performs X-rays of the mouth.
The clinic has been expanded to include diabetic screening and cancer education and screening.
Special attention is given to mother and baby care and also eating habits.
The psychology and counseling clinic conducts workshops within the communities and at schools.
Marketing agents have been to all the stopover centres six weeks prior to the train's arrival to inform communities of the services which will be provided as well as arrival dates.
The train will be at Piketberg from 4 to 8 April; Elgin from 12 to 15 April; Worcester - 18 to 22 April; Robertson - 25 to 29 April; Ashton - 2 to 6 May; Swellendam - 9 to 13 May and Oudtshoorn from 16 to 20 May.

Invitation to Comment on Draft Proposals: Provincial Spatial Development Framework
8 April 2005
SOURCE: Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
In terms of Section 4(5) of the Land Use Planning Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance 15 of 1985) the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning hereby gives notice as part of the process of drafting a Provincial Spatial Development Framework, that comments are invited on current documentation and proposals until 13 May 2005 at 12:00.
The aim and purpose of the Provincial Spatial Development Framework (PSDF) are:
* To align the PSDF with the National Spatial Development Perspective;
* To spatially reflect the vision of how the Province should develop in the broadest sense;
* To spatially integrate the strategies of the various sectors;
* To provide a framework which promotes environmentally sustainable development (i.e. ecological integrity, social equity and economic efficiency) throughout the Province;
* To ensure that these objectives are reflected in the provincial spatial economy;
* To guide the spatial development of municipalities;
* To serve as an information source and guideline to inform and direct land use management; and
* To spatially reflect the interrelatedness between ecological, social and economic activity.
To date preparatory documentation has been drafted through an inclusive process involving representatives of government, civil society, labour and business, and this documentation has been consolidated into one document.
Public comment is now being invited on the draft proposals contained in the document.
A copy of the document is available for scrutiny from Monday, April 11 at each of the District Municipalities (town planning component) and at the offices of the Director: Planning, Biodiversity Management and Coastal Management on the second floor, Property Centre, 3 Dorp Street (use entrance at 1 Dorp Street), Cape Town.

Cape Access Project
Cape Access is a community development project which sees Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) as tools to be used in building knowledge and creating opportunities.
Through this project, communities are provided with access to computers and the Internet, as well as skills to take advantage of these tools.

PILOT SITES
There are 6 pilot sites for the Cape Access project:
Area
Facility
Bitterfontein
Bitterfontein Library
Struisbaai
Struisbaai Library
Oudtshoorn
Bongulethu Library
Bambanani Multi Purpose Centre
Elim
Elim Primary School
George
Cornville Primary School
The Cape Access programme is using both new and existing infrastructure to provide rural communities with access to information technology and the benefits that can be derived from this.
By using existing computer centres in local schools and multi-purpose centres, Cape Access is helping communities to get the greatest benefit from these facilities.
New computer centres have been installed in libraries in communities where there are no facilities or extra-facilities are required.
The pilot sites situated in libraries are using the Smart Cape technology developed by the City of Cape Town for the Cape Town library access project (Smart Cape).
This provides users with the ability to register online, create their own email accounts and access the Internet.
Users are limited to 45 minute sessions at any of the five library computers.
The MPC and school sites are using the existing technology at those sites.
This may be upgraded in the future to provide users with email accounts.
e-COMMUNITY FORUMS
Each Cape Access site is centred around an e-Community Forum, consisting of various representatives from the community, including community leaders, community NGOs, facility representatives and interested community members.
e-Community Forum
Chairperson

Cornelius Ovies

Joanny Stuurman
Elim e-Community Forum
Martin Sallies
George e-Community Forum
Clive Zinkfontein
An enormous amount of time and energy has gone into the consolidation of these forums, as research has shown that many other tele-centre initiatives have failed because they focussed too much on the technological issues and not enough on the human issues around acceptance, training and promotion.
It is essential that communities play a leading role in defining what is required and how the project should operate.
Communities also need to take responsibility for the sustained use of facilities.
The e-Community Forums will manage access to the facilities as well as other logistical details.
They are also charged with mobilising the community and will play a key role in training community members.
LINKS WITH OTHER PROJECTS
The Cape Access project is part of a suite of e-society projects currently being delivered by the Centre for e-Innovation.
These projects are interconnected and adopt a holistic approach to ICT and development.
Cape Skills
Training support will be provided to the e-Community Forums through the Centre for e-Innovation's Cape Skills e-Literacy project.
The project will train members of the e-Community Forums as trainers who will in turn train members of the community.
This initiative is being run in partnership with bridges.org.
Cape Gateway
Cape Gateway is a channel through which citizens can get easy access to government information and services.
Users of the Cape Access facilities will be introduced to the Cape Gateway portal and training will be provided on how to use the portal and other government online information services.
Other projects that are interfacing with Cape Access include, RED Door, Library Business Corners and the Multi Purpose Community Centres.
FUNDING
The Centre for e-Innovation has provided funding for the Cape Access project until 2006.
Additional support is provided by the City of Cape Town through the technology, expertise and experience built around the Smart Cape Project.
Once the pilot project sites are fully operation and have been carefully assessed, the Cape Access model (as adjusted according to the assessments) will be rolled out to other communities.
It is anticipated that additional funding will be raised for this rollout from funding organisations and business.
PHASES OF THE PROJECT
Phase 1 ( July 2004 - March 2005)
* Initial research

Hands Off Our Children (HOOC)
The Hands Off Our Children Campaign (HOOC) was launched in March 2002 to help deal with child abuse in the Western Cape.
The Campaign works with communities to raise awareness about child abuse, develop prevention strategies and assist victims.
HOOC sees child abuse as a complex problem that needs to be addressed from different angles by everyone in society.
It is estimated that 500,000 children in South Africa are abused each year.
Only 15 out of every 100 incidents of child abuse in the Western Cape is ever reported.
1. Intensive Educational Schools Crime Prevention Campaign
This programme teaches educators and learners about their rights and responsibilities around abuse.
Learners are encouraged to report abuse and are provided with HOOC contact information.
2. Parental Guidance Programme
The Parental Guidance programme teaches parents how to manage their own stress and anger and how to speak to their children about sexuality and abuse.
3. Victim Support Programme
This programme assist victims of child abuse by providing emotional support and helping them debrief.
4. Multi-Disciplinary Training Programme
This initiative works with teachers, social workers, police and prosecutors to ensure better communication between them and to prevent bureaucratic delays in handling child abuse cases.

Policing Complaints Centre
The Department of Community Safety's Policing Complaints Centre deals with service delivery complaints lodged by members of the public against policing agencies such as the South African Police Service and the Municipal Police Officers.
The Centre only handles complaints regarding service delivery, for example if there has been no feedback on a case or if police officers conducted themselves in inappropriate ways.
Serious cases sucsh as deaths in police custody are dealt with by the Independent Complaints Directorate.
Once complaints are lodged with the Policing Complaints Centre an assessment and/or an initial investigation is made to ascertain the facts of the matter.
Efforts are made to resolve the issue by means of networking and interventions with the relevant role players and authorities.
If a member of a policing agency is found to be guilty of an alleged misconduct, this finding is submitted to the Provincial Commissioner and/or relevant authority for their further attention.

Annual Female Farmer of the Year Competition Opens
5 May 2005
SOURCE: Department of Agriculture (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
"We have to understand that there is no space in Agriculture for an "us" and "them" approach.
Everyone involved in Agriculture should feel at home and should know his or her specific role in the process of creating a sustainable and successfull agricultural sector," says Cobus Dowry, Western Cape Minister of Agriculture."
"As in every other aspect of life, the role and contribution of women in agriculture needs to be recognised and valued.
The annual Female Farmer of the Year competition is one of the ways in which we endeavour to do exactly this."
More than 100 women and women's groups across the Western Cape have participated in this competition over the past 6 years.
The aim of the competition is to empower women in agriculture and to increase their visibility.
At the same time it serves as an instrument through which women's significant contribution in the fight against poverty can be recognised.
The competition is run first on provincial level, whereafter provincial winners compete at national level.
3. Entries for category three - for those who sell to informal markets and are thus enabled to care for their family.
4. The last category is for candidates who produce mainly for their own consumption, e.g. vegetable gardens.
Besides great publicity and exposure for participants, they also become a rolemodel for others involved in agriculture or for those who may consider taking up agriculture as career.
The closing date for entries and nominations for the Western Cape competition is 17 June 2005.

Support for AgriBusiness
The Department of Economic Development and Tourism can refer farmers to a wide range of information, support and training programmes.
At present there is a particular focus on supporting the development and marketing of organic produce because of increased local and international demand for organic produce, the benefits of these farming methods in terms of biodiversity and sustainability, and the fact that organic farming lends itself to small-scale farming.
Organic farmers can access training, business and marketing support and technical assistance through the agribusiness support programme.
The development of potential organic farmers is being supported through the Agricultural Research Council, anationally mandated statutory body, and Elsenberg.

Information on Setting up Workplace HIV/Aids Policies and Programmes
HIV/AIDS threatens productivity, profitability and the welfare of employees and their families.
Workplace HIV/AIDS policies and programmes can play a vital role in raising awareness around HIV, preventing HIV infection and caring for people living with HIV.
* HIV/AIDS Workplace Policies
* Workplace HIV/AIDS Programmes
* Best Practices and Guidelines
* Provincial Government Involvement
HIV/AIDS WORKPLACE POLICIES
An HIV/AIDS policy is a written document that sets out an organisations position and practices as they relate to HIV and AIDS.
The Function of an HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy
An HIV/AIDS policy:
* Defines an organisation's position on HIV/AIDS and sets out clear guidelines on how HIV/AIDS will be managed within the workplace.
* Aligns the workplace response to the broader legal framework.
* Ensures fairness.
* Identifies and protects employers and employees' rights and responsibilities in the context of HIV/AIDS.
* Sets standards of behaviour expected of all employers and employees.
* Establishes consistency within the company.
* Sets the standard for communication about HIV/AIDS.
* Provides a good foundation upon which to build an HIV/AIDS workplace programme.
* Informs employees about assistance that is available.
* Indicates commitment to dealing with HIV and AIDS.
* Ensures consistency with national and international practices.
Key issues that companies should be thinking about in relation to HIV/AIDS policies.
* Recognition of HIV/AIDS as a workplace issue because it threatens productivity, profitability and the welfare of employees and their families.
The workplace, as an integral part of the community, has vital role to play in terms of prevention.
* Promotion of equality and non-discrimination between individuals with HIV infections and those without, and between HIV/AIDS and other comparable health/medical conditions.
* Creation of a supportive environment so that employees living with HIV are able to continue working under normal conditions in their current employment for as long as they are medically fit to do so.
* Protection of the human rights and dignity of people living with HIV or AIDS – such protections are essential to the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.
* Recognition of the fact that HIV/AIDS has a disproportionate impact on women – this should be taken into account in the development of workplace policies and programmes.
* Recognition of consultation, inclusivity and encouraging full participation of all stakeholders as key principles which should underpin every HIV/AIDS policy and programme.
* Recognition that HIV is preventable and that the workplace needs to promote effective prevention efforts.
WORKPLACE HIV/AIDS PROGRAMMES
An HIV/AIDS workplace programme is an action-oriented plan that an organisation can implement in order to prevent new HIV infections, provide care and support for employees who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, and manage the impact of the epidemic on the organisation.
Key elements of an HIV/AIDS Workplace Programme include:
* an impact assessment of HIV and AIDS on your organisation
* HIV/AIDS awareness programmes
* voluntary HIV testing and counselling programmes
* HIV/AIDS education and training
* condom distribution
* encouraging health treatment for STIs and TB
* universal infection control procedures
* creating an open accepting environment
* wellness programmes for employees affected by HIV/AIDS
* the provision of antiretrovirals or the referral to relevant service providers
* education and awareness about antiretroviral and treatment literacy programmes
* counselling and other forms of social support for infected employees
* reasonable accommodation for infected employees
* strategies to address direct and indirect costs of HIV and AIDS
* monitoring, evaluation and review of the programme.
BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES
For best practices and guidelines, people can be referred to these following documents, companies and organisations (form "HIV/AIDS in the workplace requires holistic, proactive solutions", Stephen Kramer, 2001):
* International Labor Organisation.

PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT
The Western Cape Department of Economic Development provides the following services relating to HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes:
* Facilitating and driving a Western Cape HIV/AIDS in the Workplace initiative, by mobilizing existing and possible new parties involved.
* Targeting the big corporate employers in the province, in terms of making sure that HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes are in place. (Give advice on developing and implementation of HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes).
* Researching the impact of HIV/AIDS on the Western Cape economy.
* Examining what has already been done in the corporate world.
Where good practices have been implemented the unit encourages firms to share what they have been doing well with other organisations and encourages media coverage of these initiatives.
* Raising awareness and providing assistance to small business through the initiatives and successes of large firms.
Organisations with less extensive programmes (SMMEs) can learn from the experiences (highlights and pitfalls) of business with established policies and programmes and can recognise the value of these initiatives.
Research indicates that many small business owners feel powerless in the face of HIV/AIDS.
They don't know the HIV prevalence amongst their staff, how to deal with an employee who is HIV-positive, or how to introduce HIV/AIDS awareness and education into the workplace.
* Encouraging companies to buy the comprehensive HIV/AIDS toolkit, produced by South African Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (SABCOHA), in accordance with international best practice.
This toolkit provides businesses, especially SMMEs, with a means of implementing cost effective workplace programmes.

Funding for Municipal Impact Projects
The Department assists local economic development projects throughout the Western Cape with funding and by providing them with expert advice, business plan development assistance and feasibility studies.
In the 2002/2003 financial year the Department assisted with five projects:
* Hydroponic farming in Beaufort West
* Expanding the Wupperthal Tea Court
* Training staff at the liquorice extraction facility in Dysseldorp
* Establishing a dried fruit facility in Van Wyksdorp
* Bitterfontein Medicinal Herbs
HYDROPONIC FARMING IN BEAUFORT WEST
A hydroponics tunnel has been set up in Beaufort West creating 14 permanent jobs for local residents.
The project is a collaborative effort between the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, the Department of Social Services and Poverty Alleviation, the Beaufort West municipality, the CSIR and the Association of Intensive Plant Production at the University of Stellenbosch.
The pilot project is expected to start making a profit in January 2004.
The project grows herbs including basil, mint, dill, coriander, rocket and sorrel for local and international retailers.
The first export shipment was flown to the UK in June 2003 to test the market there.
EXPANDING THE WUPPERTHAL TEA COURT
The Wupperthal Tea Court was assisted in expanding its facility to increase its production capacity for rooibos tea.
One hundred and seventy-one farmers from Wupperthal and surrounding communities currently participate in a program moving from wild harvesting to sustainable cultivation of rooibos for export to the world market.
Growing rooibos organically is not particularly difficult and brings farmers a better price.
As a result, all Wupperthal farmers are now growing rooibos organically.
These small-scale farmers are producing 60-70 tons of rooibos a year.
TRAINING STAFF AT THE LIQUORICE EXTRACTION FACILITY IN DYSSELDORP
The Dysselsdorp Liquorice Extraction Project is well established and employs 11 full-time and 50 part-time employees.
The Department funded the initial project and has provided accredited skills development training to 11 people at the plant.
Continuous mentorship and technical assistance is also provided to the Board of Directors.
ESTABLSIHING A DRIED FRUIT FACILITY IN VAN WYKSDORP
The Department co-funded the establishment of a dried fruit factory in Van Wyksdorp to assist in help the local community to stimulate economic development for their region.
Registering of the Section 21 Company is underway.
Fivepermanent and 60 temporary jobs have been created, with 90% of the total workforce being women.
BITTERFONTEIN MEDICINAL HERBS
The Department co-funded the test phase of production and marketing for the community-based medicinal herbs and plants job creation project in Bitterfontein.
The University of the Western Cape conducted a land potential survey to determine both the feasibility of the project and the specific crops to be cultivated in the area.
A business plan was completed and the testing period commenced in April 2003.
Preliminary market research indicates keen domestic market interest.

Permits to Drive on the Beach and Licences to Operate a Boat-Launching Site
The Department handles applications for permits to drive on the beach for the purposes of scientific research, recreational use, tourism business and gaining access to private property if there is no other access road.
The Department also handles applications for a licence to operate a boat-launching site.
The applications are assessed in terms of the National Environmental Management Act, 1998, with specific reference to Section 24(7) of the Act, in respect of the investigation, assessment and communication of the potential impact of the activity being applied for.
The Department ensures that these applications are coordinated with other related applications, namely: a lease agreement in terms of the Sea Shore Act, 1935, or an EIA application where construction below the high water mark is being applied for.
Based on this assessment, a decision will be made by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning whether the activity being applied is authorised or not.
The written decision is called a Record of Decision (ROD).
This is a legal document setting out conditions required to protect human health and the environment.

Rural Subsidies
These kinds of tenure are protected under the Protection of Informal Land Rights Act while land reform processes are implemented.However, people who don't have legal tenure are not able to access subsidies under the Housing Subsidy Scheme so a special subsidy has been developed.
WHO CAN APPLY FOR THE SUBSIDY?
The subsidy will only be granted to individuals whose informal rights are uncontested and who are unlikely to lose those rights during the current land reform process.
In addition the individual must comply with all other qualification criteria specified in 3.1.1 of the User Friendly Guide.
In terms of land held by a community, should an individual be granted a rural subsidy and then lose the rights to his or her land, a process has been put in place whereby the person can qualify for another subsidy.
While the subsidy is called a rural subsidy it is not limited to rural areas only and is made available in urban areas as well.
This form of subsidy is regarded as a subsidy of last resort as it is seen as desirable that secure rights of tenure are provided wherever possible.
The subsidy can only be accessed on a project basis, but there is no minimum or maximum number of participants imposed.
The Provincial Housing Development Boards are allowed to accredit implementation agents to identify, plan and implement projects in terms of this subsidy.
The approved subsidy is paid to financial agents identified by the Provincial Housing Development Board who administer the disbursement of the funds.
Rural subsidies may be used for any housing related purpose agreed with the Provincial Housing Development Board.

Dispute Settlement between Tenants and Landlords
Hearings and mediations are held as close as possible to the point of complaint.
The Tribunal is assisted by the Support Component of the Directorate Housing Settlement.
The Tribunal seeks to:
* Harmonise relationships between landlords and tenants in the rental housing sector.
* Resolve disputes that arise due to unfair practices.
* Inform landlords and tenants about their rights and obligations in terms of the Rental Housing Act.
* Make recommendations to relevant stakeholders.
* To promote stability in the rental housing sector in the Western Cape.
* To create mechanisms to deal with disputes in the rental housing sector.
* How do you lodge a complaint?
* Who may lodge a complaint?
* What is mediation?
* What is a hearing?
* What happens if the parties don't stick to the Tribunal's decision?
HOW DO YOU LODGE A COMPLAINT?
Complaints must be lodged on the complaint form which can be obtained from the Tribunal.
A case file will be opened and a reference number allocated.
The Tribunal will conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the complaint relates to a dispute in respect of a matter which may constitute an unfair practice.
An inspector may inspect the property concerned and compile a report if necessary.
The Tribunal must, within 30 days of receipt of the complaint, determine whether the complaint relates to a dispute in respect of a matter which may constitute an unfair practice.
If the complaint does not relate to such a dispute, the complainant will be notified in writing.
If the complaint does relate to such a dispute, the Tribunal will try to resolve the matter with informal/formal mediation.
If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the case will be referred for a ruling at a formal hearing.
WHO MAY LODGE A COMPLAINT?
Any tenant or landlord or group of tenants or landlords or interest group in the Western Cape Province may lodge complaints to the Western Cape Rental Housing Tribunal.
WHAT IS MEDIATION?
It is a process that encourages people to resolve disputes by talking in an informal, safe and confidential manner.
Trained, experienced and impartial mediators help the parties to come to an agreement.
The parties decide what is in the agreement and not the mediators.
An agreement can be made an order by the Tribunal.
WHAT IS A HEARING?
A hearing is a process whereby the both parties can state their cases, with supporting evidence, in order for the Tribunal to make a ruling which is final and binding on the parties.
Proceedings of the Tribunal can only be brought under review before the High Court.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PARTIES DON'T STICK TO THE TRIBUNAL'S RULING?
A ruling by the Tribunal is regarded as an order of a Magistrates' Court.
* Fail to attend a hearing without sufficient cause.
* Refuse to be sworn in.
* Refuse to produce any document or object in his possession
* Intend to deceive the Tribunal.
* Wilfully make false statements.

Application for Support from the National Empowerment Fund (NEF)
This service describes the functions of the National Empowerment Fund and how to access their spectrum of services.
It is particularly relevant for the start up business person, however there are also very useful services for large corporates.
* WHAT IS THE NATIONAL EMPOWERMENT FUND?
* WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NEF?
* HOW DO I APPLY FOR FUNDING?
What Is the National Empowerment Fund?
The NEF was established by the National Empowerment Fund Act of 1998 to promote and facilitate economic equality and transformation.
The National Empowerment Fund (NEF) was re-launched in May 2004 by the Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa to re-focus and refresh these efforts.
The NEF Trust operates under the umbrella of the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) and is governed by a board of trustees under the Chairmanship of the director-general of the dti, Dr Alistair Ruiters.
Find out more about its history on the website.
Its main objective is to become a catalyst in facilitating economic equality and transformation, thereby maximising the empowerment dividend.
The passing of the broad based empowerment charter, government policy and other sectoral charters; and a deeper understanding of the current market needs led to the new mandate which resulted in the enhanced operational business pillars of the NEF.
These are:
* Advisory Services, which will oversee the consistent standardisation and application of the charters across the government and private sectors.
* Corporate Transformation Services, which will sustain transformation targeted at corporate and regional levels on a specific basis determined by national importance.
* Market Making Services, which will play a catalytic role in facilitating BEE investment opportunities that will ensure ownership sustainability and transformation within the HDP sector.
* Group and Entrepreneurial Schemes, enterprise development and synergistic partnership formation to leverage offerings.
What Is the Philosophy of the NEF?
* NEF looks to finance BEE groups who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and add value to the transactions by maximising transformation.
* The focus is on regional and community development to energise enterprise growth.
* The NEF will also provide a BEE advisory service to both Government and the private sector to enable consistent charter application across all sectors.
* NEF will have significant input into the development of strategy to maximise transformation in targeted areas and sectors in the economy.
* NEF will assist rural communities in uplifting themselves through targeted offerings.
* NEF will act as a medium for dialogue with the private sector on their corporate and industrial strategy for transformation and BEE.
* NEF will act as mediator between the private, public and empowerment sectors on transformation and BEE objectives including enterprise development.
How Do I Apply for Funding?
The NEF's funding activities are currently focused under Entrepreneur Support, which exists in the Group and Entrepreneurial Schemes division (GES).
This offering provides acquisition and enterprise finance to support historically disadvantaged South African entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneur Support provides equity and debt funding in accordance with venture capital principles, within a development context.
To access products under GES, a funding application process is initiated by the completion of a screening application form that tests for the eligibility criteria and commercial viability.
For more information on these criteria and assistance on our products and services, please refer to our website address: www.nefcorp.co.za.

Voting in the National and Provincial Elections
These elections take place every five years.
They determine who will rule the country and how many seats each political party will have in parliament.
They also determine which party will run each province.
The first democratic elections were held in 1994.
The ANC won the elections with 63% of the vote.
The last National Elections were held in 1999 when the ANC won 66.35% of the vote.
You can view the results of the provincial election online.
The next elections will be in 2004.
To vote in the elections, you first need to be registered on the Voters' Roll.
You will then be able to vote at the voting station in that area that you are registered in.
* You enter the voting station and your name is checked against the Voters' Roll to make sure that you are registered and that you haven't already voted.

Home > Publications > Public Information > I &gt Immunisation is Safe
Immunisation is Safe
Department of Health (The Government of South Africa)
This fact sheet explains what measures are undertaken to ensure that vaccines are safe.
IMMUNISATION IS SAFE
EPI(SA) Fact Sheet
* Introduction
* Desease Burden Versus Risk
* Vaccine Safety and Quality
* EPI(SA) Vaccines
* Immunisation Safety Project
* Roles and Responsibilities
* Challenges
1. INTRODUCTION
When the World Health Organisation (WHO) began it's immunisation programmes in 1974, less than 5% of the world's children were immunised.
Twenty-six years later, it increased to 75% of children.
Millions upon millions of children's lives have been saved and the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been considerably reduced.
While many diseases have disappeared from the public eye, paradoxically the debate about safety of immunisation is still very much alive.
Lack of public confidence in immunisation programmes has resulted in a concomitant drop in vaccine coverage levels (in some countries by 25% by the mid 1990s).
Global communications, increasing consumer awareness, greater scientific knowledge and more open debate about health matters have all contributed to greater public scrutiny of healthcare issues and more scepticism about the intrinsic value of immunisation.
2. DISEASE BURDEN VERSUS RISK
Emphasis on Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) rather than lives saved and a lighter disease burden have contributed to fanning emotional responses without necessarily balancing the facts.
The number of groups that actively seek information and knowledge about the risks and benefits of medicinal products has burgeoned as one public health crisis leads to another.
Vaccine-associated adverse events have drawn public attention and criticism.
It appears that the public focus has shifted from acute risk of deadly diseases to longer-term concerns about quality, safety and equity.
The risks of disease and complications resulting from withholding immunisation, should be communicated to parents and communities.
Health care workers need also be reminded of the great benefits of immunisations.
No child should be denied immunisation without serious thought as to the consequences, both for the child and the community.
3. VACCINE SAFETY AND QUALITY
Over the years, the WHO and its partners have deployed continuous efforts and resources to improve safety of immunisation.
New delivery technologies including the auto-disable syringe (which does not allow re-use of the syringe) have been introduced.
Each country has a National Control Authority (NCA) that assesses the quality of vaccines, whether locally produced or imported, and ultimately authorises or rejects their public use.
WHO considers a vaccine to be of good quality provided that an independent NCA has controlled the vaccine in accordance with the requirements defined by the WHO.
There should be no remaining problems related to the vaccine quality.
All vaccines used within the national immunisation programmes should, as a minimum, meet the WHO quality requirements.
4. EPI(SA) VACCINES
Vaccines are tested for safety and efficacy in clinical trials and then in mass trials before being registered and made available in South Africa.
All vaccines are evaluated by the NCA in South Africa, namely the Medicines Control Council (MCC) to ensure efficacy, quality and safety prior to registration and approval for marketing.
All vaccines used in the EPI(SA) Programme are manufactured according to strict safety guidelines.
These vaccines meet World Health Organisation (WHO) standards of quality, safety and efficacy.
Vaccine batches intended for use in the country are tested at the National Control Laboratory (NCL) in Bloemfontein, prior to release.
After introduction into the immunisation schedule there is ongoing surveillance of safety and efficacy through trials and post marketing surveillance by the MCC, EPI Programme and Vaccine Suppliers.
The EPI Programme in South Africa introduced a active surveillance system for Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFIs), 1995, in all the provinces.
The purpose of the EPI system for AEFIs is to
* improve the quality of immunisation services;
* to increase public acceptance of immunisation; and
* to ensure that any such event is handled in a way that is acceptable to the patient, the parents and the vaccinators.
AEFIs may range from the common redness and soreness at the injection site, to rare, serious conditions such as the potential risk of a severe allergic reaction in 1:100 000 to 1:1 000 000 doses of measles vaccine.
AEFIs may also be:
1. Programme - related
2. Vaccine - induced
3. Coincidental
4. Unknown
5. IMMUNISATION SAFETY PROJECT
In order to keep pace with new science, new technology and public concerns, WHO has created the Immunisation Safety Priority Project, which will focus on:
* ensuring vaccine safety from clinical trials through the point of use
* research and development of safer and simpler vaccine delivery systems
* expanded access to safe and effective delivery technologies and their disposal
* identification and management of risks related to immunisation
In the heated debates that immunisation provokes, it is important to consider the risk/benefit ration and to put AEFIs into perspective.
Vaccines are known to be among the safest and most cost effective health interventions.
Reports linking immunisation to an AEFI that are later proven to be a coincidence and unjustified continue to occur.
These unfounded reports which have not been fully investigated, have a potential to do a lot of harm to the image of the programme.
Arguments against immunisation derive their power from unjustified scares and misconceptions.
It is important to remember that the RISK of the DISEASE is far higher than the RISK of giving the VACCINE.
6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the joint responsibility of governments, regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers and communities to report any untoward events related to immunisation.
There is a need to respond with facts and empathy to the concerns of parents and communities.
7. CHALLENGES
The approach requires a combination of a caring attitude towards parents and infants, up to date knowledge and a positive attitude towards immunisation.
There is no need to be defensive about immunisation.
It is a known fact that the vaccine-preventable diseases are severe and immunisation prevents them!
New challenges in the field of vaccine development and vaccine safety lie ahead.
More complex vaccines are being developed and tested that may require increasingly sophisticated screening and monitoring systems.
At the same time, these vaccines should reduce delivery schedules, simplify delivery technologies and offer good price/benefit ratios in overall public health terms.
Other than improved housing, sanitation and clean water supply, vaccines have had unparalleled success in reducing the incidence of death and disease.
Paradoxically, this success may result in an undue emphasis on vaccine side effects.
Risk communication offers a set of tools for explaining risks in proportion to benefits.
When we refer to the safety of any drug, we are talking about relative safety, that is safety relative to the alternative of not using vaccines.
The EPI Programme will continue to work with all partners to improve all aspects of immunisation, such as vaccine safety, training and work with the industry to improve delivery technologies.
It is by improving the quality of health care and keeping in mind the benefits that preventive health measures such as immunisation can offer, that tomorrow's world will be a healthier place.
The Department of Health will continue to promote the benefits of immunisation to all South Africans, all health care workers and the health care providers.

How Can I Best Help and Support My Friend Living with HIV/AIDS?
Question: I am a close friend of a person living with HIV/AIDS.
How can I best help and support my friend and at the same time also deal with the emotional effect and impact this has on my life and relationships?
Answer: A diagnosis of HIV/AIDS affects more than just the individual.
It may affect family, friends and even the community.
The diagnosis and the knowledge of living with HIV may be painful and affect many areas of life: physically, emotionally, socially, financially and spiritually; it may put extra strain on individuals and relationships.
As the support person your 'emotional stressors' may be similar to the person living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA).
Feelings of anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, helplessness and ambivalence may arise and come and go at any time.
These feelings are natural, but are hard to deal with.
It is important for you to identify and know the overwhelming feeling you have towards your friend and find support to deal with it.
In the context of the your relationship to the PLWHA on a day-to-day basis, withdrawal, conflict, codependency, resentment, role changes and sex may become issues.
In the outside world, family, finances and stigma could impose extra burdens.
It is important to remember that even though your needs and feelings may seem irrelevant compared to those of the loved ones, they should not take a back seat.
They are of equal worth to the PLWHAs.
If you do not deal with your own feelings and needs, they will only magnify, cause resentment and many other negative and hard to deal with emotions.
The best way to handle them is to talk about them to someone you feel safe with.
While you may be able to talk to some of your friends, this is not always possible.
Friends may not always understand what you are going through.
Also, you may have been sworn to secrecy and not be able to confide in your closest friends.
Another place to talk through the difficulties, to share your experiences and find support from the sharing of similar experiences may be with a support group.
This may be a safe place for venting unwanted and negative feelings for example, resentment, guilt, fear or even rage without feeling guilty, and without hurting anyone in the process.
Apart from providing emotional support, support groups may also be able to help with networking, medical or care issues, financial problems, by, for example, starting a vegetable garden or learning beadwork skills, and child care or parenting skills.
The PLWHA should also be encouraged to join a support group for people living with HIV for the same reasons.
For the PLWHA to know that they are supported and accepted is vital.
Simply by being there, listening, acknowledging confusion, touching, being silent, laughing and crying is sometimes the best that you can do.
As a friend, you have the opportunity for an increased sense of sharing, increased appreciation of time together and deeper and more intimate and open levels of communication together.

Tourism Road Signage Application
You may apply for a tourism sign to be erected near your tourist facility.
Three types of facility can apply:
* A tourist facility which comprises tourist attractions, tourist services, accommodation and special events.
* A community or public service facility which consists of major traffic generators (such as a regional shopping centre) and minor traffic generators (such as a place of worship or licensing office).
* A commercial or business service or product which is indicated by signs located alongside (but outside) the road reserve which are directed at drivers.
You can make an initial application for road signage to your nearest Local Tourism Bureau (LTB).
Based on the application details the LTB makes a recommendation.
The details are then passed on to a higher tourism authority where more considerations and recommendations are made.
Following the various investigation processes, a letter of recommendation can be issued and if the application is successful the sign can be erected.
In general, the owner/operator of the facility pays for the provision of non-emergency tourism signs, e.g. for attractions or services.
Provided that all the required information has been given promptly, the application consideration process should not be longer two months.
The document, Guidelines and Application Form for Tourism Road Signage, contains an information sheet for application plus all the necessary forms.
Applicants can obtain this document from their nearest LTB.
Once you have completed the initial sections of the application form, you should return the documents to the LTB for consideration.
For further information refer to the Provincial Tourism Facility Audit and Signing Framework for the Western Cape document.

Movement Restrictions on Pigs in Hex River Valley and Worcester Area to Control the Outbreak of Classical Swine Fever Remain in Force
17 August 2005
Press Release by the Acting Minister of Agriculture: Department of Agriculture Western Cape: Mr Pierre Uys
The Acting Minister of Agriculture of the Western Cape, Mr. Pierre Uys has announced that the control of the outbreak of classical swine fever in pigs in the Hex River Valley and Worcester area has progressed very well.
An estimated 1009 pigs died of the disease on the infected properties.
To date a total of 1591 pigs of 97 owners were destroyed and buried and compensation paid at market related to the amount of R1,3 million.
Surveillance activities are continuing to ensure that pigs that might be carrying the disease are detected without delay.
All infected holdings have been disinfected and inspected by Veterinary Services personnel.
This process is almost complete but the minimum required disease-free period will remain in place until 30th September provided no further infection is detected.
No movements of pigs may take place without a permit issued by the Department of Agriculture of the Western Cape.
An embargo on the restocking of farms where pigs have been removed and destroyed remains in force until 30th September.
The Director of Veterinary Services of the Department of Agriculture, Dr. Gideon Brückner said that a national survey has also been launched by the National Department of Agriculture to detect if the disease is present in pigs elsewhere in the country.
He expressed his appreciation for the excellent cooperation that was given by stock owners within the Hex River Valley as well as the support received from the Provincial Disaster Management Unit, the SAPS and the Provincial Traffic Department.

Minister Uys Visits Groote Schuur Hospital's Renal Dialysis Unit in Support of Kidney Awareness Week
23 uAgasti 2005
South Africa's kidney transplant programme is amongst the best in the world with a success rate equal to all leading organ transplanting countries, says Western Cape Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys.
There is, however, a dire need for greater organ donor awareness.
"At present one third of our donors are living relative (family) donors and the rest cadaver donors.
We would prefer 100% cadaver donors, but to achieve this, it is essential to promote a much greater public awareness regarding organ donation.
Donors can also carry organ donor cards," says Uys.
Kidney transplants at Groote Schuur Hospital are already at 58 this year compared to the 51 done last year.
We can all contribute to help ease the burden on organ transplants at our hospitals by adopting a lifestyle minimising the risk of kidney disease.
The most important steps to keep kidneys healthy include:
* Giving up smoking.
* Limiting alcohol: limit alcohol intake to two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.
* Enjoying life: Reduce stress by doing things you like doing.
* Good nutrition: Eat lots of fruit, stick to lean meat and avoid fatty foods.
* Drinking water: Water assists in transporting nutrients around the body.

Tips for Tendering
September 2005
Economic Participation (Department of Economic Development and Tourism, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
This document contains tips from procurement officers in the Provincial Government on how to improve your chances of successfully bidding for government tenders.
The following are common mistakes made when tendering:
1. Always provide all of the information requested by in the tender application.
Do not forget things like your tax clearance certificate and shareholding certificates.
Note: out-dated tax clearance certificates are also not allowed.
2. It is important that the calculations of tender prices is correct.
Check and DOUBLE-CHECK this!
3. Often, tenderers misinterpret the scope of the work.
If you are unsure of anything in the tender ASK!
4. Always SIGN your bid document.
Unsigned documents are unresponsive and will therefore be disqualified.
5. If you are an HDI, remember to claim your points.
Points unclaimed are points lost!
6. Make sure that you drop the tender into the right box, before the closing time.
By law, no late bids will be accepted, not even 1 second past the closing time.
7. If samples are requested, sufficient amounts must be supplied to enable the item to be evaluated under the appropriate technical or clinical conditions.
Ensure that any requirements related to compliance with SABS specifications are met.
Tips from the procurement officials:
1. Always read through the bid documents carefully.
2. Complete the document in full.
3. Do a proper cost analysis when calculating your bid prices.
Bids calculated too high or too low are considered unresponsive.
4. Enquire about the bid and obtain all the relevant information before completing the tender document.
5. Feel free to ask why you were unsuccessful so that you may learn from mistakes made.
6. Make sure that you are able to meet all the requirements within the specified time and are able to honour your offer in the event that your bid is successful.
7. Do not make any misrepresentations or false statements in your bid documentation.
It is a legal document and therefore enforceable by law.
8. Quality services and products will improve your track record and good standing with the department.
Poor delivery creates a negative impression not only for your business but for all small businesses in general.

Consultative Workshop on Khoisan Languages (13 - 14 Nov 2005)
Workshop
Knysna, Knysna Municipal Offices
On 4 June 2005 the Western Cape Language Committee held a certificate ceremony signalling the end of the 5-year research process on Khoisan languages.
The need for this research was identified at "Poem se Voetrus" near Oudtshoorn in November 2000.
During the past five years members of the Khoisan community in the Western Cape participated in research on Khoisan languages and 18 workshops on the Nama language were held in six different regions of the province.
This five-year process has culminated in the production of a research report on Khoisan languages and a booklet and CD comprising a basic introduction to the Nama language.
On 13 and 14 November 2005 the Language Committee will be holding consultative workshops with representatives of the Khoisan communities who participated in the above-mentioned processes to get their input on a long-term (3 to 5 year) strategy for the further promotion and development of Khoisan languages in the Western Cape.
Such strategies should be based on the principle of building on what had been done in the first 5-year process, i.e. how to use the material produced.
Representatives from PanSALB (Pan South African Language Board), the National Khoe and San Language Body, and Ms Nomvula Mbangela, Department of Arts and Culture co-ordinator for the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape, will be invited to give their input in an attempt to strengthen ties and co-operation between the different organisations.
The workshop will be held at the Southern Comfort Western Horse Ranch near Knysna.
For more information contact the Western Cape Language Committee on 021 483 9677 or send an email to exa@pgwc.gov.za.

Multi-Drug Resistant TB Fact Sheet
Multi-Drug Resistant TB, like "Ordinary" TB, can be prevented and treated.
Early presentation to a local health facility and adherence to prescribed treatment will prevent further spread of the disease.
Encourage everyone who is coughing for more than 2 weeks to be tested for TB and everyone on treatment to complete their treatment.
* What is MDR TB?
* How many people in the Western Cape Province are affected with MDR TB?
* What causes MDR TB?
* Can someone develop MDR TB without ever having been infected with "ordinary TB"?
* Who is at risk of contracting MDR TB?
* Is it easier to get MDR TB?
Is MDR TB more infectious than "ordinary" TB?

* Is there a link between HIV/AIDS and MDR TB?
* Can an HIV infected person or person living with AIDS take both MDR TB and Antiretroviral treatment at the same time?
* What is meant by an "outbreak" of MDR TB?
* In the case of an outbreak of MDR TB, how is further spread of the infection prevented?
What is MDR TB?
Multi-Drug Resistant TB (or MDR TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria (germs) that are resistant to the usual drugs used to treat "ordinary" TB.
In other words, the normal drugs that we use to treat "ordinary" TB will not work.
How many people in the Western Cape Province are affected with MDR TB?
* The Western Cape Province has relatively low rates of MDR TB, compared to other provinces and elsewhere in the world.
* Of all people who are diagnosed with TB for the first time, 1% (1 in 100) will have MDR TB, and of all people who are diagnosed with TB after having been treated for TB before, 4% (4 in 100) will have MDR TB.
* The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks South Africa the 9th country in the world who notifies the most number of TB cases every year.
* More than 44, 000 people were diagnosed with TB in the Western Cape in 2004,
* This means that although the rates of MDR TB are low in the Province, there is still a large number of people diagnosed with MDR TB in the province each year.
* On average between 450 and 600 new cases of MDR TB are diagnosed in the Western Cape annually.
What causes MDR TB?
MDR TB is caused by the development of TB bacteria, which have become resistant to ordinary TB drugs.
This occurs as a result of inadequate or irregular management of "ordinary" TB, either by using inappropriate drug combinations or by using single drugs for "ordinary" TB, clinics running out of drug stocks, inadequate counseling of patients leading to patients not taking their treatment correctly (poor treatment compliance) or patients not returning for treatment (defaulting treatment).
Can someone develop MDR TB without ever having been infected with "ordinary TB"?
Most MDR TB will develop as a result of poor adherence to the treatment for "ordinary" TB; however it is possible for someone who has never had or been treated for TB before to be infected with bacteria that are already resistant to ordinary TB drugs, if they have had close contact with someone with MDR TB.
Who is at risk of contracting MDR TB?
Anybody who is exposed to someone with MDR TB may be at risk of developing it.
Most people who have strong immune systems will not develop the disease, as their body's immune system can fight the infection.
* Babies and children under 5 years of age (They will need to have treatment to prevent TB disease if exposed to someone with TB)
* HIV infected persons
* Malnourished persons
* Persons living in overcrowded households/ public institutions like prisons
* Persons whose immune systems are not strong due to other diseases e.g. Diabetes Mellitus, cancer and some medications
* Persons with substance abuse problems e.g. alcoholism or drug abuse.
Is it easier to get MDR TB?
There is no evidence to suggest that it is easier to get MDR TB than ordinary TB.
TB of the lungs is relatively more infectious than TB affecting other organs/ systems of the body, as the bacteria may be excreted and spread by air-borne droplets.
What are the symptoms (complaints) of persons with MDR TB?
• The symptoms are the same as for "ordinary" TB
• A persistent cough for longer than 2 weeks.
• The cough may be productive and blood stained, chest pain, loss of weight and loss of appetite and night sweats.
How is MDR TB diagnosed?
Once a person presents with symptoms of TB, or is found to be a close contact of somebody with TB, clinic staff will request the person to provide two sputum (spit) specimens (phlegm from coughing), which will be sent to the laboratory for testing under a microscope.
In addition to the normal tests done for TB, additional tests called culture and sensitivity testing, are done on the sputum specimens of people suspected of having MDR TB.
These specialized tests take three to four weeks to reveal growth of the resistant TB bacilli, and to see which drugs will work against the bacteria.
In addition, chest X-rays may be done in certain circumstances to see the extent of any lung damage and for future monitoring of response to treatment.
Can patients with MDR TB be treated and cured?
MDR TB is more difficult to treat than ordinary TB, because the TB bacilli are resistant to the drugs used to treat ordinary TB.
"Second line" TB drugs are used, which are less effective and have more side effects.
Treatment outcomes are not as good as those with drug sensitive TB, partly because MDR TB tends to occurs in people with extensive lung damage who have been on and off TB treatment a long time.
If diagnosed early the chances of cure are much better.
On average, less than 50% of people with MDR TB will be cured, and about 30% will die before completing treatment.
How is MDR TB treated?
Patients with MDR TB will have to take at least 5 different drugs, including a daily injection for 4 months 5 days a week.
During this time most patients with MDR TB are admitted to hospital so that they can be closely monitored for adherence to treatment and to monitor any side effects.
Thereafter patients will need to take at least 3 different drugs for a further 12 – 16 months 5 days a week.
Thus, treatment is much longer than for "ordinary TB" (which takes between 6 to 8 months), and can go on for up to 2 years.
The length of treatment is to ensure that the disease does not relapse.
How can the spread of TB be prevented (including MDR TB)?
When coughing or sneezing, any person and especially those with TB or MDR TB should cover the nose and mouth with a tissue to prevent air-borne spread of the bacilli.
Patients should also avoid spitting into open air/ the ground.
Good ventilation of households is strongly recommended, people are encouraged to keep all windows and doors open.
If possible limit prolonged contact (includes avoiding sharing the bedroom at night) with persons with ordinary TB or MDR TB, while their sputum remains positive with TB or MDR TB bacilli.
Can a person with MDR TB continue to work, and if not, are they eligible for a disability grant?
When the patient is taking treatment regularly and once the sputum has been tested and shows that they are no longer excreting MDR TB bacilli, the person can resume working.
If the patient is assessed and declared to be "physically incapacitated" by a medical doctor, they may apply for a temporary disability grant.
Is there a link between HIV/AIDS and MDR TB?
Infection with TB also increases illness and progression (morbidity) of HIV, including increasing the death rate (mortality) in HIV infected people.
Thus it is extremely important for TB to be prevented and/or detected and treated as early as possible in HIV infected people.
It is important to remember that even if someone is HIV positive TB can be treated and cured!
Can an HIV infected person or person living with AIDS take both MDR TB and Antiretroviral treatment at the same time?
The two treatments may be taken concurrently.
Close monitoring by an experienced medical doctor is necessary for patients on both therapies.
What is meant by an "outbreak" of MDR TB?
By definition any disease outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of the particular condition than would normally be expected in the particular circumstances.
The disease cases must be epidemiologically linked (that means that medical staff are able to establish definite links between the cases), as opposed to occurring by coincidence.
In the case of an outbreak of MDR TB, how is further spread of the infection prevented?
Once an MDR TB case is suspected, active case finding is undertaken, i.e. we actively look for all persons who may have contracted the infection before they present ill to health facilities.
This is done to limit the potential spread of the infection by as yet undiagnosed persons.
Sputum tests for MDR TB are done and appropriate treatment is offered to confirmed cases.
At the same time, these persons should be removed from the community until they have received treatment and are no longer infectious.

Early Detection is the Key to Survive Breast Cancer
18 October 2005
The incidence of breast cancer among South African women is increasing, with more than 3 800 cases being diagnosed every year, says Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys.
In a statement in support of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Uys says breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in this country.
About 90% of patients survive for many years after diagnosis when breast cancer is detected at the early stages.
The designation of October as "Women's Health and Breast Cancer Awareness Month" in South Africa reflects a nationwide drive by public and private healthcare structures to raise awareness of this debilitating disease.
Risk factors for female breast cancer include early menarche (period), late age at first childbirth, a high-fat diet and certain genetic mutations.
Other suggested risk factors include, to a lesser extend, high alcohol consumption, contraceptives use and the use of certain post-menopausal hormone replacement therapies.
The risk of developing breast cancer among South African women (aged 0-74 yrs) is 1 in 31 females.
Uys says health services the world over have come a long way in fighting this dreaded disease.
"Treatment is, however, expensive and every new facility this province gets to help us in our fight against cancer is welcomed.
We have a new CT scanner at Groote Schuur Hospital and injected an extra R1 million for the treatment of mainly head and breast cancers.
"We do this because cancer patients often still have many fruitful years ahead with special treatment.
We in the Western Cape are fortunate that we do have excellent cancer treatment facilities throughout the province, but if there is no early detection through regular examination, survival chances are drastically reduced," says Uys.

The software programme is to be utilised for the purpose of disaster management preparedness planning.
ISIQALO:
1 uJanuwari 2002
ISIPHELO:
31 uDisemba 2004
The disaster management software programme will provide a mechanism whereby all applicable organisations will forward information to the Sub-directorate Disaster Management, which in turn will then co-ordinate the combined database as required for the establishment of the Provincial Disaster Management Centre.
The software programme (GEMC3) can escalate an incident from a municipality to the next level of governance and has the capability to activate the relevant disaster management plan.
Furthermore the system has the following capabilities:
* Strong mapping and live vehicle and resource tracking capability.
* Live video feed.
* Log the impact of a disaster.
* Create step-by-step audit trail of who has done what, when, as the disaster intervention is taking place.
* Produce SITREP's for National Disaster Management Centre.
One of the issues that have to be contended with is the connectivity between the municipalities and SITA's Openet Wide Area Network.
Only once this connectivity has been established can the installation commence.
The software programme has been used in several instances, namely:
Grabouw Informal Settlement Fire
Numerous shacks were destroyed by fire at the Grabouw informal settlement in the Boland on Sunday 23 September 2002 and hundreds of people were left homeless.
The 2003 Cricket World Cup
The 2003 Cricket World Cup (CWC) was held in South Africa and participating teams competed on a number of cricket pitches across South Africa.
The CWC organisers went to great lengths to ensure the safety of the cricketers, the spectators and visiting dignitaries.
The organisers achieved this by preparing substantial disaster management plans for both cricket stadiums.
The 2003 and 2004 Cape Argus Pick n Pay Cycle Tour:
The negative publicity of the 2002 Cycle Tour raised some concerns and the Race Organisers approached the PGWC for help.
The PGWC agreed to assist the Race Organisers.
* Provincial EMS Ambulances were made available to the Organisers
* DMIMS was made available to the Race Organisers
* EMS staff members assisted the Race Organisers with, incident management; call taking and registration of incidents in the DMIMS; dispatching of resources to incidents.
Montagu Floods of March 2003:
During March 2003 a cut-off low developed over the mountains in the Boland.
As the cut-off low deepened a weather situation developed that caused extremely heavy rainfall to occur across the entire Southern Cape region.
Because of the flood damage caused, the State President declared the region as a national disaster area.

RAVA - Risk and Vulnerability Assessment of the Western Cape
The main purpose of this study is to develop appropriate, user-friendly decision support management tools for the Western Cape to assist the Provincial Disaster Management to execute risk and vulnerability assessments and to formulate appropriate disaster prevention and mitigation strategies for the Province.
2003
Completed
Disaster Management is responsible to identify potential hazards, while the line Departments and Municipalities are responsible for preventing and reducing the risk of applicable hazards.
During the 2002/03 financial year the Universities of Cape Town and the Free State were appointed to conduct the first phase of the RAVA project, namely to scientifically identify potential hazards in the Western Cape.
This project has the following outcomes:
* To generate standardised user-friendly maps of natural and other hazards.
* To present hazards in GIS (Geographic Information System) formats that can be linked to other provincial maps and information to improve planning and disaster management efforts.
The use of computers and communications technology in manipulating and moving data, in a timely and efficient manner is recognised by the Provincial Government Western Cape.
The DMIMS will offer a very important tool for planning, warning and responding to disasters.

18. How do I go about lodging a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal?
19. How can I contact the Western Cape Rental Housing Tribunal?
MUST I SIGN A LEASE WITH MY LANDLORD?
A verbal agreement is as binding as a written lease.
However, if a written lease is required for you to occupy premises and you refuse to sign it, there is no agreement and you can't legally move into the property.
If you have rented a property on a verbal basis for some time and your landlord then asks you to sign a lease, you do not have to sign a lease with terms that are different to your verbal agreement.
Rather, the landlord will have to negotiate new terms with you and secure your agreement first.
Remember, it is always better for both of you to have your agreement in writing, setting out the terms and conditions of your agreement.
This will go a long way to preventing later disputes.
WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE ON A WRITTEN LEASE?
* Your name
* Your landlord's name
* Your postal address
* Your landlord's postal address
* The address of the property being leased
* The amount for which you will rent it
* The amount by which the rent will increase (for example, by 10 percent when renewing the lease)
* When the rent will increase (for example, if there is a rates increase)
* How often rent is to be paid (for example, monthly)
* The amount of the deposit, if any
* Your and your landlord's obligations (For example, who is responsible for maintenance?
Who will pay the water, electricity and rates bills?
Usually, the tenant pays for charges related to consumption, such as water and electricity, and the landlord pays for charges related to the property, such as rates)
* The conditions under which either you or your landlord can give notice to cancel the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not done, or if the tenant is in arrears with the rent)
* The House rules, signed by both of you, should be attached to the lease.
* A list of defects, drawn up at a joint inspection when you move in and signed by both of you, must also be attached to the lease.
MUST I PAY A DEPOSIT?
Yes, if the landlord asks for one and it is stipulated in the lease.
If the terms of your original agreement, whether oral or written, did not include a deposit, you need not pay one if the landlord asks you to do so later.
Changes to an agreement are only valid if both you and your landlord agree to it.
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY DEPOSIT WHILE I'M LIVING ON THE PROPERTY?
The landlord or his agent must keep your deposit in an interest-bearing account (or trust account, in the case of an agent) for the time you are living on the property.
The full deposit amount, plus the interest earned, must then be returned to you when you move out less the costs of damages caused by you and any monies you may still owe to the landlord in terms of the lease.
WHAT MAINTENANCE MUST THE LANDLORD DO?
It depends on what your lease says.
Usually, a landlord maintains the outside of the property and a tenant the inside.
WHAT CAN I DO IF THE LANDLORD REFUSES TO MAINTAIN THE THINGS HE SAID HE WOULD?
Lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.
CAN MY LANDLORD ENTER THE PROPERTY WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?
Your landlord has a right to enter the property to perform routine inspections and so on, but only after letting you know well in advance to arrange a time that suits you.
You do not have the right to deny him reasonable access.
CAN MY LANDLORD INCREASE MY RENT WHEN HE WANTS TO?
No, the lease or verbal agreement determines when, and by how much, your rent can be increased.
If the agreement does not specify an amount or date for an increase, the landlord has to negotiate the increase with you.
Neither you nor your landlord can make changes to your original agreement without checking with the other party first.
BY HOW MUCH CAN MY LANDLORD INCREASE MY RENT WHEN I RENEW THE LEASE?
This is specific to the renewal terms of your agreement.
If your agreement doesn't specify a reasonable escalation, your landlord has to negotiate an acceptable rent with you.
WHAT CAN I DO IF MY LANDLORD SAYS I HAVEN'T PAID THE RENT WHEN I HAVE?
It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord receives the rent, so it will be up to you to provide proof of payment (for example, a bank-deposit slip).
If you can't, your landlord will be able to give you notice in terms of your agreement and seek a court order for eviction.
It is your right, in terms of the Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999), to insist on a receipt for all payments if your landlord does not automatically supply you with one.
A receipt must contain the following information:
* The date of issue
* The address of the property for which the payment is made
* The reason for the payment (whether it's rental, arrears or a deposit)
* The period of the payment (for example, the month for which the rent will be paid).
If your landlord refuses to give you a receipt, lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.
CAN MY LANDLORD TAKE MY POSSESSIONS IF I FALL BEHIND ON RENT?
He has to obtain a court order first.
Then the Sheriff of the Court will attach your property to the amount of the money you owe.
If your landlord takes your possessions without a court order, it's theft and you should contact the South African Police and lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.
HOW CAN I END MY LEASE EARLY?
It depends on the cancellation clause in your agreement.
If there is no such clause, the only way you can end your lease early without being in breach of contract is if your landlord agrees to it or if your landlord is in material breach of the lease (for example, by failing to maintain the outside of the property, as agreed in the contract, and this makes it impossible for you to remain on the property.
But you will have to prove this, though).
If your landlord has met all the conditions of the lease, you can still end the lease early but will yourself be in breach of contract.
This means your landlord can demand the balance due by you for the rest of the lease period, and you may lose your deposit.
Speak to your landlord before making a move: many are willing to allow subletting or to terminate a lease after a suitable notice period on condition that you find a suitable replacement tenant.
If your landlord agrees to terminate a contract prematurely, be sure to get it in writing, outlining the terms and conditions of the termination.
MY LEASE EXPIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO.
HOW MUCH NOTICE MUST I GIVE BEFORE I CAN MOVE OUT?
Check your previous lease for a renewal clause that outlines how much notice you must give in such a situation.
If there is no such clause, then the two of you have, through your actions, effectively renewed the previous lease, on the same terms and conditions, and for the full period stated in the original agreement.
This means that you will have to invoke the cancellation clause of the original lease, if there is one, in order to get out of the agreement.
Without a cancellation clause, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your landlord one month's notice, in writing, before the lease expired. (So if you were nearing the end of a 12-month lease, you should have let your landlord know, in writing, at the end of the eleventh month.)
CAN MY LANDLORD LOCK ME OUT?
No. Your landlord must give you a duplicate key immediately if he changes the locks due to wear and tear or some other reasonable cause.
CAN MY LANDLORD REFUSE TO RETURN MY DEPOSIT?
A deposit is there to cover any money you may still owe your landlord, and/or the cost of repairs to any damage to the property, exceeding fair wear and tear, that you have caused.
If your landlord retains your deposit and is unable to furnish you with proof of the costs he has incurred, you should lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.
To prevent this, be sure to follow these steps:
* When you move in, inspect the property together and list, in writing, any existing defects.
Both of you should sign this document and it must be attached to the lease agreement.
* When you move out, inspect the property together again.
Compare the new list of defects with the list made earlier.
* You may be given a chance to repair the damage yourself, or you can agree that the landlord will do it.
If the landlord does the repairs, you have the right to see all receipts for repairs paid for out of the deposit.
* If repairs cost less than the deposit plus the interest accrued, your landlord will have to reimburse you the difference.
Contact the Rental Housing Tribunal if you have problems.
WHICH LAWS GOVERN RENTAL AGREEMENTS?
* Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999)
* Law of Contracts
* Common Law
* Constitution

18. Which laws govern rental agreements?
19. Who can help me if I have problems with my tenant?
20. How do I go about lodging a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal?
21. How do I contact the Rental Housing Tribunal
MUST I SIGN A LEASE WITH MY TENANT?
A verbal agreement is as binding as a written lease, but if your tenant insists on having something in writing, you must comply.
It is, however, better for both of you to have your agreement in writing to set out the terms and conditions agreed upon.
This will go a long way to preventing later disputes, when it is your word against your tenant's.
* Your tenant's name
* Your tenant's postal address
* The amount for which you will rent it out
* How often rent is to be paid, (for example, monthly)
* Your and your tenant's obligations (for example, who is responsible for maintenance?
Usually, the tenant pays for charges related to consumption, such as water and electricity, and the landlord pays for charges related to the property, such as rates.)
* The conditions under which either you or your tenant can give notice to cancel the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not done, or if the tenant is in arrears with the rent)
* The House rules, signed by both parties, should be attached to the lease.
HOW DO I CHECK A POTENTIAL TENANT'S BACKGROUND?
Speak to the tenant's current landlord for a reference.
It's also a good idea to speak to previous landlords, as the current landlord may give a good reference as a way to get rid of an unwanted tenant, and to get a letter from your tenant's employer to verify his permanent position and income.
You can also do an ITC credit check (call TransUnion ITC on 0861 482 482 or visit www.transunionitc.co.za).
SHOULD I ASK FOR A DEPOSIT?
Yes, it's a good idea to put it in the lease.
Remember that the deposit must be put in an interest-bearing account for the duration of the lease and given back to your tenant, plus the interest it has earned, when the tenant moves out.
If, however, your tenant still owes you money on moving out, or if the property has been damaged beyond normal wear and tear, you can use the deposit to pay for repairs or to cover the money owed to you.
See WHAT CAN I DO IF THE TENANT HAS DAMAGED THE PROPERTY? for more on deposits.
WHAT MAINTENANCE MUST THE TENANT DO?
CAN I INCREASE THE RENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A LEASE PERIOD?
BY HOW MUCH CAN I INCREASE RENT WHEN I RENEW THE LEASE?
It depends on what it says in your contract.
If your contract doesn't specify a reasonable escalation, you will have to negotiate an acceptable rent with the tenant.
WHAT CAN I DO IF MY TENANT HAS NOT PAID THE RENT ON TIME?
Technically, your tenant is in breach of contract.
Refer to the breach clause of your contract (or, in the case of a verbal agreement, the agreed on terms for termination) and act on it.
If you don't have a cancellation agreement, it is good practice to write a letter giving your tenant seven days to pay, failing which you will cancel the lease.
WHAT CAN I DO IF A TENANT CLAIMS TO HAVE PAID THE RENT, BUT I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT?
It is your tenant's responsibility to make sure that you receive the rent, so your tenant will have to show you proof of payment (for example, a bank-deposit slip).
If your tenant can't do so, you can give your tenant notice in terms of your agreement and seek a court order for eviction.
If you are satisfied that payment has, indeed, been made, you are then obliged in terms of the Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999) to provide you tenant with a receipt.
CAN I TAKE MY TENANT'S POSSESSIONS IF THE RENT IS IN ARREARS?
You will have to obtain a court order first.
The Sheriff of the Court will then attach your tenant's property to the amount of the money due to you.
If you take your tenant's possessions without a court order, it's theft.
MY TENANT'S LEASE EXPIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO.
HOW MUCH NOTICE MUST I GIVE, SHOULD I WANT MY TENANT TO MOVE OUT?
Without a cancellation clause, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your tenant one month's notice, in writing, before the lease expired. (So if you were nearing the end of a 12-month lease, you should have let your tenant know, in writing, at the end of the eleventh month.)
HOW DO I EVICT MY TENANT?
You can never evict a tenant yourself.
You can only seek a court order to evict a tenant if your tenant is in breach of contract.
To find out if your tenant is in breach of contract, check your agreement.
There should be a clause saying what constitutes a breach of contract (for example, not paying the rent on time) and what your rights would be in such a case (in other words, cancel the lease without further notice).
If your tenant is indeed in breach of contract, take steps to strongly urge your tenant to rectify the breach.
If this does not work, take legal action - lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal or seek the help of a competent attorney.
CAN I ENTER THE PROPERTY WITHOUT MY TENANT'S PERMISSION?
You have a right to enter the property to perform routine inspections and so on, but only after arranging with your tenant to do so at a reasonable time, and with reasonable notice.
Your tenant does not have the right to deny you reasonable access.
CAN I CHANGE THE LOCKS AND LOCK MY TENANT OUT?
If you change the locks, you have to give spare keys to the tenant.
WHAT CAN I DO IF THE NEIGHBOURS COMPLAIN ABOUT MY TENANT?
Check if the tenant's behaviour is in violation of the House rules.
If so, you may be able to invoke your lease's cancellation clause and give your tenant notice.
Keep a paper trail of complaints and your actions as proof.
WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK MY TENANT IS INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON MY PROPERTY?
Report your suspicions to South African Police Services.
It is also a good idea to add a clause to your lease stating that no illegal activities are to be conducted on the property, which would give you grounds to cancel the lease immediately.
WHAT CAN I DO IF THE TENANT HAS DAMAGED THE PROPERTY?
If you asked for a deposit, you can use the money to repair damages attributed to the tenant beyond normal wear and tear when the tenant moves out.
Be sure to follow these steps:
* When your tenant moves out, inspect the property together again, ideally no earlier than three days before the tenant moves out.
Compare the new list of defects with the list you made earlier.
* You may give the tenant a chance to do the repairs personally, or you can agree that you will do it.
Hold on to receipts for repairs paid for out of the deposit.
Your former tenant has a right to see them.
* If repairs cost less than the deposit plus the interest accrued, you will have to reimburse your former tenant with the difference.

Integrated Development Planning (IDP)
Municipalities draw-up a single development plan each year that includes strategies, projects and budgets for the year.
The Local Government Development Directorate helps municipalities with the drafting, implementation and the review of Integrated Development Plans (IDPs).
It provides help by assisting municipalities to get:
* access to training
* access to technical expertise
* information on funding
* guidance on the best practice of drafting and implementing a municipal integrated development plan.
The diagram below illustrates what the IDP consists of and what its ultimate aims are.

In addition to business registration certain businesses are required to get a business licence in terms of the Businesses Act.A business licence is generally required for businesses that need to comply with health and safety regulations.
Licences are required for the following businesses:
* making or selling food which can go off
* health or entertainment activities (including businesses offering saunas, massages, snooker, billiards, slot machines, night clubs, and cinemas).
Your local municipality handles business licences and you can contact them for details on licensing procedures and the various health and safety regulations required for different kinds of business.
Depending on the type of business, you may need to comply with the following requirements:
* zoning
* health
* safety (particularly fire).
If you comply with all the requirements, you will be issued with a licence.
If not, you can apply for a 14-day grace period, during which you can make changes to your premises so that they meet the requirements.

Cape Town City Police
The Cape Town City Police (CTCP) is a municipal police service.
The main function of the CTCP is visible policing.
They also make arrests and issue fines for all types of offences.
These can be serious crimes, traffic offences, and local by-laws within the City ... &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;

Home > Your Government > City of Cape Town > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Police > Calling for Emergency Help
You therefore need to dial different numbers for different government emergency services, unless you are in the City of Cape Town metropolitan area, which already has its own single emergency number (107).
For an emergency that needs police response, you should dial 10111.
For an emergency that requires an ambulance, you should dial 10177.
For both of these you must be able to say where you are and why you need the emergency response.
Both of these numbers can be dialled for free.
In the City of Cape Town metropolitan area, you can dial 107 (at no cost from a landline or public phone) for ANY emergency or disaster.
You must state the nature of the emergency (fire, mountain rescue, traffic accident, crime, etc.) and the operator will ensure that the right emergency response helps you.
You should also be able to state where the emergency is.
Dialling 107 from a cell phone won't work.
To dial the Cape Town single emergency number from a cell phone, dial 021 480 7700.
Normal cell phone charges apply.
However, if you are calling from a cell phone you can dial 112 and you will be linked to your cell phone company's emergency call centre.
A call to 112 on a cell phone is free and is even possible on a cell phone that does not have airtime (it should also be possible even if you don't have a SIM card).
Emergency calls take priority and if the network is busy, other calls will be dropped to take your emergency call.
The networks must, in terms of their licences, provide this access to five emergency services (fire, ambulance, police, sea rescue and traffic).
The cell phone networks also have different special emergency services that you can dial in addition to 112 or as part of 112 dialling.
Check with your network (Cell C, MTN or Vodacom) to find out what these are.

These can be serious crimes, traffic offences, and local by-laws within the City of Cape Town.
However, they do not investigate cases after arrests, as this is the function of the Detective Service of the South African Police Service (SAPS).
They share traffic policing functions with the Provincial Traffic Service.
The CTCP can be distinguished from SAPS (who wear blue uniforms) and traffic officers (who wear light blue uniforms) by their black-and-white uniforms with black-and-white check detail.
Their cars and motorcycles are also marked with the black-and-white check detail.
The CTCP was established on 1 December 2001 in terms of the South African Police Services Amendment Act 1998.
In other cities, such as Durban and Johannesburg, the traffic services immediately became part of their city police services.
In Cape Town, this is going to happen slowly and most traffic officers will become city police constables by 2010.
Everyone who joins the CTCP has to have special training at the Municipal Police Training College in Philippi before becoming a city police constable.
There is a committee called the Civilian Oversight Committee, which is responsible for making sure the CTCP operates properly.
They also advise the head of the CTCP about his/her duties, and evaluate the performance of the CTCP.
The Committee is made up of seven City Councillors and seven ordinary civilians.
The CTCP have offices all over the city.
They have two main offices, one in Cape Town and one in Mitchell's Plain, with Mitchell's Plain office being the only 24-hour office.
The head of the CTCP at present is Mark Sangster.
You can contact the Civilian Oversight Committee through Anton Visser on telephone 021 400 1405 or anton.visser@capetown.gov.za.

The content on this page was last updated on 18 March 2009
Home > Your Government > City of Cape Town > Services > Transport > Traffic, Accidents & Road Safety > Traffic Fines: City of Cape Town
These include the Atlantis, Durbanville, Elsies River, Helderberg, Milnerton, Oostenberg, Ottery Hill and Parow Traffic Departments.Violations that take place in other areas are dealt with by the relevant municipality's Traffic Department.

6. How much time do I have to pay my traffic fine?

8. What happens if I don't pay my traffic fine?
WHERE CAN I FIND OUT IF I HAVE OUTSTANDING TRAFFIC FINES?
Call Traffic Inquiries during office hours (Monday to Friday, 8am to 3.30pm) on 0860 034 637.
If you would like a printout of your fine, you will have to go to the traffic department in person.
If you suspect that the traffic department may be sending fines to an old address, please fax your new address (physical and postal), along with a copy of your ID, to Motor Vehicle Registrations on (021) 419 1676.
Mark it for the attention of the Correspondence Department.
Call Motor Vehicle Registrations on (021) 400 4900 if you need further information about this.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAFFIC FINES?
There are two kinds of traffic fines: Instant Summons and a 341 Traffic Ticket.
* Instant Summons is issued when a traffic officer pulls a motorist over to issue a fine for the following: a moving violation (for example, speeding or going through a red traffic light), a default on your motor vehicle (for example, a broken taillight), an expired motor-vehicle licence or for driving a vehicle without a driver's licence.
* A 341 Traffic Ticket is issued when a motorist is caught violating a traffic regulation by camera (for example, when speeding) or when a traffic officer issues a ticket when the motorist is not present (this is the pink ticket issued for parking violations, expired licence disks and so on).
WHERE CAN I VIEW THE SPEED-CAMERA PHOTO?
To view your photos you will need to know:
* The municipal district in which the photo was taken
* Your vehicle registration number
* The film number, which appears in the traffic fine.
Camera fines that start with "2" can only be viewed at Parow Traffic, Oostenberg Traffic, Helderberg Traffic, Milnerton Traffic South Peninsula Traffic and Cape Town Traffic between 8.30am and 3pm.
HOW CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?
If you are paying before the due date, you can pay your traffic fine by cheque, cash or postal order:
* Cheques and postal orders should be made out to City of Cape Town.
* Payment can be made either in person at the traffic department (find the address at Municipal Traffic Departments) or mailed to:
Private Bag X019
Roggebaai
8012
* Given the levels of fraud and theft in the Post Office, it is not recommended to send cash by post.
* If you are a First National Bank customer, you can also pay your fine at any FNB ATM using your fine reference number.
If you wish to pay on or after the due date, you can do so by cash or bank-guaranteed cheque at the court mentioned on the fine (find the address at Municipal Courts).
You will have to make the payment in person no longer than 14 days after the due date.
On the fourteenth day, your case will appear in court.
If you do not wish to pay your fine you will have to appear in court, in person, on your court date to argue your case.
If you are not there to argue your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued.
CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE ELECTRONICALLY?
If you are a First National Bank customer, however, you can pay your fine at any FNB ATM using your fine reference number.
HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE TO PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?
Depending on whether you have been issued an Instant Summons or a 341 Traffic Ticket, you have between 30 days and four months to pay your traffic fine.
An Instant Summons has a court date and you have 30 days from the date of issue to pay the fine at the traffic department or at the court mentioned on the summons.
If you pay the fine on the date of your court appearance, you will have to pay it in person at the court.
If you receive a 341 Traffic Ticket, you have 30 days before the Traffic Department will issue a "Notice Before Summons", after which you will have another 30 days before the summons will actually be issued.
After the summons is issued, you have another 30 days to pay your fine to the Traffic Department.
After the 30 days have passed, you have another 14 days of grace in which you can pay your fine at the court mentioned on the summons.
So in total, you have approximately four months to pay your traffic fine after receiving a 341 ticket.
CAN I CONTEST A FINE?
If you plan to contest your fine send a letter stating your reasons, along with a copy of your fine, to the Gallows Hill Traffic Department.
You can also fax the information to 021 421 6607.
You should receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the traffic department within about three weeks.
The Traffic Manager will then send your letter to the relevant court.
The Public Prosecutor at the court will review the fine, which takes a maximum of two days, after which the letter and the decision will be sent back to the Traffic Manager, where it is re-captured.
This process takes approximately three weeks.
The whole process takes about six weeks.
You can also contact the Public Prosecutor directly at the court that appears on your fine.
If you have received a summons, you should contact the Public Prosecutor before the date you are due to appear in court.
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?
If, for example, the traffic fine has been issued in error you may plead your case in court on the court date of your summons.
If you do not go to court to argue your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued and you will be charged with being in contempt of court.

CAPE WINELANDS DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY: OVERVIEW
The Cape Winelands District Municipality covers the Witzenberg, Drakenstein, Stellenbosch, Breede Valley, and Breede River / Winelands Local Municipalities.
District municipalities administer and make rules for a district, which includes more than one local municipality.
The purpose of district municipalities and local municipalities sharing the responsibility for local government in their areas is to ensure that all communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, have equal access to resources and services.
This will help some local municipalities who don't have the capacity (finances, facilities, staff or knowledge) to provide services to their communities.
It will also help to cut the costs of running a municipality by sharing resources with others.
The 'richer' areas will help the 'poorer' areas.

Umphandle > Urhulumente > uRhulumente Wephondo leNtshona Kapa > Iindaba > Statement by Provincial Health Minister Pierre Uys on Combating Diarrhoeal Disease in the Western Cape
14 uNovemba 2005
The summer is upon us and with the heat comes Diarrhoeal Disease, said Minister Uys today during a visit to Mitchell's Plain Community Health Centre.
Minister Uys said the Western Cape Department of Health will combatdiarrhoeal disease and increase immunization in the province as part of its2005 Christmas Deliverables campaign.
The disease peaks during Februaryand March.
Diarrhoeal disease is especially prevalent in summer because of more flies and higher water infection.
The highest incidence occurs in low income areas and especially in the informal settlements.
Minister Uys said children under the age of two are especially vulnerable and mothers need to wash their hands regularly.
The Department will combat the threatening diarrhoeal disease through the employment of 74 community-based workers trained in the IntegratedManagement of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy.
These community-based workers are based in affected areas such as Khayelitsha and the Eastern Klipfontein sub-districts.
In addition the Department has also employed and trained four coordinators in the IMCI-strategy.
This IMCI-strategy was originally developed by the World Health Organisation and focuses on the child as a whole, rather than on a single disease or condition.
"Sick children often arrive at primary health care facilities with a number of sicknesses and have to be managed in an integrated manner at home and at the clinic" min Uys said.
The aim of this intervention is to expand services in Khayelitsha with an additional service in Mitchell's Plain.
This is in line with the Provincial Government's Ikapa Elihlumayo strategy as it forms part of building human capital and strengthening social capital.
Minister Uys said by Christmas this year, a total of 134 community-based workers will assist and strengthen the Department's fight against diarrhoeal disease.
Every year, about 12 million children in developing countries die before they reach their fifth birthday, many during the first year of life.
Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to five main diseases: acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles, malnutrition, and malaria.
Minister Uys urged mothers to wash their hands regularly.
"If your children have the disease they must be given fluids immediately to prevent dehydration," he said.
There is a simple recipe of a mixture mothers can give to their children:
* Wash a bottle and a spoon
* Wash hands with soap and water
* 1 Litre of clean water (if in doubt boil)
* 8 teaspoons of sugar
* Half a teaspoon of salt

Provincial Minister of Health, Pierre Uys, Opens Revamped Trauma Unit at Elsies River
3 November 2005
A revamped trauma unit which practically doubles the capacity of the old unit, was opened by the Western Cape Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, at the Elsiesriver Community Health Centre this week.
"Our new six-bed trauma unit with its own waiting room, consultation chamber, dedicated chairs for asthma sufferers, new ablution facilities which can also accommodate the handicapped and which also has its own funeral parlour, is a far cry from the old four-bed trauma unit which was struggling to cope with the daily congestion," says Uys.
The unit serves the communities of Elsies River, Matroosfontein, Leonsdale, Eureka, Clarke and Balvenie Estates, Epping Forest, The Range, Connaught Estate and Uitsig.
After hours the unit also serves the entire Tygerberg sub-district - in total some 43 000 people.
In addition to the upgraded trauma unit the health center was also equipped with a centralised oxygen system replacing the old mobile system, an intercom and a fire-alarm system.
"The upgrading of our health facilities in the province is ongoing, prioritising the facilities where the need is the greatest, with the ultimate aim of good health facilities accessible to all," says Uys.

Statement by Provincial Health Minister Pierre Uys on strengthening Home Based Care Services in the Western Cape
21 November 2005
The important role of home-based care in the Western Cape Health Services was emphasised again today by min. Uys during his visit to health care workers at Citrusdal.
Home Based Care is the provision of basic nursing care needs by formal or informal caregivers to sick people in the comfort of their homes.
Amongst people who qualify for this care are those who have had strokes, who are living with HIV and Aids, who are physically or mentally challenged, frail older persons, or those who are terminally ill.
"Home-based care is not a 24-hour service and does not replace the family as the primary caregiver, but it is only meant to be a complementary and supportive service to prevent caregivers, who have no other option but to care for sick relatives from overworking themselves" says Uys.
Community-based care is the care that people can access nearest to home, which encourages participation by people, responds to the needs of people, encourages traditional community life and creates responsibilities.
Caregivers from the various organisations have to complete a home-based care course facilitated by the Department of Health.
Continuous, in-service training is provided by the Department to ensure competence.

The Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport is about to embark on a process to establish a Musicians Resource Office that would address issues pertaining to professional performing artists.
All current and aspiring persons in the music industry are invited to provide information as well as details in order for a provincial database to be collated, which would be administered by the Musician's Resource Office.
Registered persons on the database will be invited to initiatives organised by the Interim Western Cape Musician's Association.
Are you?
* Involved in African music (traditional and contemporary)/ Jazz/ Classical/Opera/ Choral/ Hip Hop/ Reggae / Gospel/ Rap/ Kwaito/Rhythm and Blues/Cape Minstrel music / Ghoema music
* A disc jockey (DJ's)/ sound engineer/ studio musician/ technician
* A music researcher/ teacher/ lecturer/ producer/ conductor/ composer/independent music school
* A promoter/agent/manager?
Organisations and individual music practitioners who fall within the above-mentioned categories and genres should forward the following information:
1. Full name and surname
2. Area of specialisation within the industry
3. Contact details, including postal address, e-mail and telephone number/s
4. Employment status within the industry: full-time or part-time
5. An indication of international networks (please specify)
6. Personal information, including gender and ID numbers
Private Bag X9067, Cape Town 8000.
Registration forms are available at our offices.
NOTE: The Database will be used to provide effective information to music practitioners and others with an interest in the music industry to structure the music industry and ensure equal access to the industry's resources.
The database would assist in identifying, nurturing and developing young talent to become tomorrow's musical icons and ambassadors.
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INTERIM WESTERN CAPE MUSICIAN'S ASSOCIATION

Young people participating in the programme are provided with training which enables them to earn credits against the National Qualifications Framework.
Phase 1
In the first phase of the programme, trainees received skills, work experience and ultimately job placements in the gardening, laundry, cleaning, child-care and aged-care sectors.
Phase 2
For Phase 2, 40 young people have been selected from all of the Training Workshops Unlimited training centres.
Each selected trainee will undergo comprehensive training in Hygeine and Cleaning services and related lifeskills.
Trainees will then be placed into positions in the Athlone, Retreat, Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha communities, where they will conduct voluntary work.
Job coaches will visit the trainees at the community placements to provide them with ongoing support and to monitor their progress.
ENROLLING AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE PROJECT
Young people with intellectual disabilities can apply to join the Training Workshops Unlimited programme.
Participants for the Siyanceda project are selected from those involved in the workshops.
SIGNING UP FOR PLACEMENTS WITHIN YOUR ORGANISATION
To prepare them for future employment, the Siyanceda trainees need to experience what it is like to work in a real work environment.
Placement within organisations in selected communities, provides real experience to the workplace and offers a valuable, free service to the community.
Organisations and businesses in the following communities can benefit from the internal and external cleaning services offered by the Sioyanceda programme:
* Athlone
* Retreat
* Mitchell's Plain
* Khayelitsha
The organisation is only required to pay for cleaning materials.
Organisations and companies interested in applying to take on board the Siyanceda trainees and make use of the cleaning services offered on a volunteer basis can contact any of the Job Coaches during business hours or call the Siyanceda Project Manager on 021 638 3143 or email stephan@trainingworkshops.co.za.

"We are deeply disturbed and shocked by the reports in the media detailing the disappearance of a number of children in the Western Cape over the past few weeks."
In the last two weeks:
* Newly born baby from Delft went missing but later found alive and well in a Delft home.
A 25 -year old woman was arrested.
* Albert Smith, 2, from Athlone, disappeared Saturday afternoon.
* Joey Josephs, 3, from Delft went missing on Wednesday night.
* On Monday the charred body of a girl of about eight was found in a bushy area in Zeekoevlei near Grassy Park.
The recent incidences of severe crimes committed against children in the Western Cape has prompted the Department of Social Services and Poverty Alleviation to fast-track a programme of action to protect children who are one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society.
MEC for Social Services and Poverty Alleviation Koleka Mqulwana has made child protection a key focus area in her interaction with communities via recent Imbizo processes.
The children - targeted in particularly poor communities - will also receive meals for the duration of the programme.

18 uNovemba 2005
During a visit to Hermanus Hospital today Minister Uys said "well-functioning equipment is crucial to the delivery of quality health services" The Hospital received a new gastroscope worth R 120 000 and 3 infusion pumps worth R30 000.
"This December, as part of the Christmas Deliverables campaign, the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health will spend millions on medical equipment in an attempt to improve access to quality health services" min. Uys says this morning at the Hermanus Hospital.
The Health system is set for a big boost with the purchasing of various state-of-the-art and much needed medical equipment such as a gastroscope, x-ray rooms and a colposcope that will offer top-class medical treatment to the affected facilities where there is a need for these equipment.
In this financial year the Department of Health will spent close to R130m on new equipment.
Min Uys said the new equipment comes just at the right time, as the Festive Season is upon us and through past experiences the health facilities are busier than usual as a result of more road accidents and violence.

Pollution and Waste Management (Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
Cleaner Production is changing the way we do and use things, by making them more efficient and causing less pollution and waste.
It is based on the principle that prevention is better than cure.
This can lead to fundamental changes in people's mindsets and their actions.
This publication provides tips on how you can save energy, save water and minimise waste.
INTERESTING FACTS
" For every kilowatt hour of energy used almost one kilogram of coal is burned."
"Water is a scarce resource and the Western Cape no longer has suitable places to build dams."
"There will only be two operational landfills left in the next two years!
A new landfill is being sought but will cost millions to build and no-one wants it in their backyard."
"The world produces an average of 4 tons of CO2 per person per year, South Africans each produce 10 tons of CO2 per person per year."

WHY IMPLEMENT CLEANER PRODUCTION IN YOUR HOME
* IT SAVES YOU MONEY!
* It conserves natural resources, like water
* It reduces water and air pollution
* It creates a healthy environment for you family
HOW TO SAVE ENERGY!
The following are some examples of what can be done in your home to make it more energy efficient:
1. Hot Water Geyser
* Insulate the geyser by wrapping it in a geyser blanket and save R10 and R20 / month.
* Install a timer on the geyser to avoid heating up water when you don't need it.
This can save up to 20% on your electricity bill.
* Install a solar water heater.
This pays back in electricity saving over approximately 8 years and utilizes a renewable source of energy.
* Particularly is you are building a new house, it is a sound economic choice.
Estimated savings of 20-40% of the total electricity bill.
2. Lighting
* Use CFL's or LED's, which are more energy efficient, rather than normal incandescent lights for any lights which stay on longer than an hour or two per day-especially good for outside fittings which stay on all night.
* Switch lights off when you leave the room.
3. Heating your home
* By insulating your ceiling you can save half of heating electricity.
* Include passive solar features if you are designing a new house:
* Enough north facing window areas
* Roof overhangs of the correct length to keep summer sun out but let winter sun in
* Installing ceilings, note that it is difficult to warm up a double volume house
* Insulate your walls and floors well, or use thermally efficient building materials.
HOW TO SAVE WATER
The following are some examples of what can be done in your home to make it more water efficient
1. By reducing your toilet flush volume you can save 20% of your total water consumption with no reduction in convenience.
Dual-flush or multi-flush systems can be installed.
The dual-flush device has two fixed settings-a light setting for urine and a heavier one for solids.
The multi-flush device lets you flush any amount you want-just lift the handle back up and the flush stops.
2. By installing a system to pump grey water (from the washing machine, basins, shower and bath) to the garden, most households will eliminate the need for any additional garden watering.
This can reduce your consumption by 35%.
These systems cost around R4 500 to install, but will pay themselves back in water savings in about 2 years.
3. Fitting low-flow showerheads will reduce shower water used by 50-75%.
Various types are available depending on the level of user comfort desired.
Showering is in any case more water efficient than bathing, even without these shower heads.
4. Tap aerators reduce the flow in kitchen taps by around 50-75%.
Normally much water from these taps flows straight down the sink without being used.
HOW TO MINIMISE WASTE
The Western Cape is producing more waste than it can dispose of.
The Average Capetonian produces 1.6 kilograms of waste per day.
Water seeping through the landfills pollute the groundwater and the earth.
The following points give you some ideas of what can be done in your own home to minimise the amount of waste that you produce.
1. Recycle as much of your refuge as possible.
The following products can be recycled: paper, glass, tins, plastic, organics and car oil.
There are recycling depots at a number of schools or organistions.
Contact your local municipality or telephone directory to find a recycler near you.
Make use of a twin or trio bin system.
These are household bins that have been separated into compartments to allow for easy recycling.
Different recyclables can go into different colour coded compartments.
2. Compost your organic material (kitchen and garden waste).
Compost can be used in the garden by mixing it with the soil to improve the soil structure.
It increases the amount of organic matter in the soil and provides nutrients that will assist the plants to grow.
3. Re-use containers as much as possible and ensure that the goods that you buy are not overpackaged in plastic.
If they are, complain!
It raises awareness.
* If you are decorating, chooses paints and varnishes that are solvent-free and organic.
* Switch off your television instead of leaving it on standby-TV's on standby still consume a quarter of their normal power.
* Make use of public transport or walk or cycle to work or to the shops.
Driver a smaller car as this uses less fuel, releases less pollution and requires fewer resources to manufacture.
WATER-WISE GARDENING
Because gardens are often so water intensive, it is useful to look at principles of water-wise gardening.
They are also lower maintenance than normal gardens.
The following tips are taken from “Water-wise gardening” (DWAF and NBI, 1998):
* Grow water-wise plants-generally the best suited plants are those indigenous to the area as they seldom need additional watering.
* Group plants according to their water needs-this avoids wasting water on plants that don't need it.
* Consider the quality and type of your lawn-lawns guzzle water, so consider reducing your lawn area.
* Improve the soil and mulch- soil water-holding capacity is improved by higher organic matter content.
Mulching (covering the soil with a thick layer of bark, compost, straw, etc) keeps the soil much more moist.
* Plant in the right season-For winter rainfall areas, this is in autumn and early winter so the plants have a chance to develop their root systems before the dry season.
In summer rainfall areas, it is spring and early summer for the same reason.
* Water correctly-avoid watering during the heat of the day or in windy conditions.
One of the best irrigation systems is drip irrigation-it uses 25% of water used by normal irrigation system with the same effect, and can even be placed under lawns.

"29 million condoms will be distributed by the Health Department in ourprovince alone this year " Minister Uys said today.
Minister Uys said you can get an STI from having sex only once with an infected partner.
There are more than 20 different types of infection, which can be spread through sexual contact.
Some of these are syphilis, gonorrhoea (drop) and herpes.
There are no visible signs of the illness in the early stages and it may take years before a person becomes ill.
During this time the infection can be passed on to sexual partners.
Minister Uys says one in every 10 sexually active persons in SA is infected with an STI.
He said that if it is left untreated, STI's can cause :
* infertility
* cancer of the sex organs
* abnormalities or death of unborn babies
* damage to the heart and kidneys
* mental illness
Minister Uys said people must know their bodies and seek medical treatment at our health facilities when they notice the following signs:
* Abnormal discharge from sexual organs.
Even a slight watery discharge may be an indication of an STI
* Sores, warts or blisters around the sex organs, which may be painful orpainless
* Swollen glands near the sex organs
If a person is diagnosed with an STI or notice some of the signs, he or she must
* Inform all their sex partners if there are more than one (although this is not recommended) and get them to go for treatment as well, even if they have no signs of any infection
* Take the full course of medicines and do not share it with their partner
* That person must get his or her own medicine.
If you don't take the fullcourse, you may think you are cured, when in fact you are not
Minister Uys said to condomise is the best prevention."
Always use a condom when you have sex, as that will greatly reduce your risk of getting an STI"

Zenzele Road Maintenance Programme
To implement a road maintenance program employing the maximum number of people from the local community.
2009
The Zenzele Road Maintenance Programme aims to create long term job opportunities for local communities.
The programme is an initiative of the Community Based Public Works Programme (CBPWP) and aims to improve the existing roads infrastructure by employing community members to conduct routine and periodic road maintenance.
The CBPWP works with municipalities to identify operational areas and set up projects.
Projects in these operational areas are supervised by contracted Zenzele project managers.
Local community participation is facilitated by the CBPWP through community meetings.
Approximately 12 - 25 Community Development Workers (CDWs) are employed by the CBPWP for a 12 month period for each project.
The CBPWP conducts a skills audit of prospective CDWs and appointments are strongly gender and youth-focused.
CDWs are contracted to work for 60 hours per month and are provided with bicycles to access their work areas.
Work activities include clearing alien vegetation, cleaning drains and culverts, removing litter and foreign objects from roads, repairing potholes and washing roads signs and hazard plates.
Workers also report major repairs.
Each worker is allocated approximately 1km of road.
The CBPWP provides roads maintenance training for CDWs as well additional life skills and HIV/AIDS awareness training.
Social Facilitators monitor CDWs and aim to identify future opportunities for them such as additional training, placement or entrepreneurial opportunities.

Local Councils with Wards
Large municipalities are divided into wards.
People in local councils with wards will have three votes in the 2006 municipal elections to ensure that they are represented at every level in their local government:
* 1 vote for a Ward Candidate: This vote is for a person, the ward candidate, who can be an independent or a party candidate.
* 1 vote for your Local Council: This vote is for a party.
The more votes a party gets, the more representatives it will have on the Local Council.
* 1 vote for your District Council: This vote is for a party who will represent you on the District Council.
District Councils manage a district which consists of several Local Councils.
Metropolitan Councils
There are six metropolitan areas in South Africa - City of Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni, Tshwane, Ethekwini, Nelson Mandela and City of Cape Town.
These areas are run by Metropolitan Councils.
Metropolitan Councils consist of ward councillors and party representatives.
If you live in one of these metropolitan areas, you will have two votes in the 2006 Municipal Elections, one vote for a ward candidate and one vote for a party:
* 1 vote for a Party: This vote is for a party who will represent you on the Metropolitan Council.
The more votes a party gets, the more representatives it will have on the Metropolitan Council.

Klein Karoo National Arts Festival 2006
29 uMatshi 2006
Message By Western Cape Premier Ebrahim Rasool
Cultural festivals in the Western Cape have one thing in common: they serve as a mirror in which communities in our province can see themselves as diverse groups - all of them embedded in one opulent Western Cape mosaic.
To really be able to build a Home for All in the Western Cape, it is important that we should open up to one another and create an environment in which we will be free to interact with other people.
This is what makes arts and cultural as well as community festivals such as the Little Karoo National Arts Festival (known as the "KKNK") so valuable and enriching.
We should continue to introduce and expose our people to the rich diversity of cultures, beliefs, practices and values in the Western Cape, and enable them to enjoy the pleasure of really beginning to understand one another and developing a deep appreciation for each other.
That is why the Provincial Government of the Western Cape is continuing its support of iconic events and festivals such as the KKNK and other festivals in the province: these events are vital for discovering what is important to fellow Western Cape residents and for learning more about it.
The image in the mirror is a fine one - let us make sure that as many people as possible get to see it and enjoy its beauty.
I wish to thank the management, participating artists, sponsors, the community of Oudtshoorn and surrounding areas, and all other role-players for helping us build A Home for All.
Our best wishes for another magnificent festival!
Kind regards
Ebrahim Rasool
Premier of the Western Cape

Free Water and Electricity
Government has announced its intention of providing free basic water and electricity services for all.
There is also an initiative to provide free sanitation services.
FREE WATER
By July 2001, approximately 23 million people in South Africa were receiving Free Basic Water.
The aim ultimately is to provide poor households with a basic supply of 6 000 litres of safe water per month free of charge.
This might vary from municipality to municipality and you should contact your municipality directly to find out exactly what the free basic water service is that they provide.
You are required to pay for water that is used over and above the free supply.
For more information, contact your local municipality or contact:
Simpiwe Mashicila
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry
Tel: 021 946 3666
Fax: 012 323 3877
mashics@dwaf.gov.za
FREE ELECTRICITY
Free electricity services are specifically targeted at poor households.
These households will be provided with an small amount of electricity for free but they must pay for any electricity that is used over the basic service level.
The proposed amount of free electricity is 50kWh per household per month for a grid-based system.
This is the approximately the amount of energy needed for basic lighting, running a small black and white TV and a small radio, basic ironing and basic water boiling through an electric kettle. 50Wp will be provided per non-grid connected supply system for all households connected to the official non-grid systems.
Users who have pre-paid electricity meters will be able see when the free electricity is used up and will be able to buy more electricity at their own expense.
Users with credit meters will not be able to see easily when they have used up their units.
They will be charged for additional use at the end of each month.
Free Basic Electricity will be phased in from July 2003, after Municipalities have received their funds from the Department of Provincial and Local Government.

SANITATION
Following from the successful implementation of the Free Basic Water programme, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is now in the process of developing a National Free Basic Sanitation Strategy.
This is being done with guidance from the National Free Basic Water and Sanitation Task Team, which is chaired by SALGA and co-ordinated by DWAF.
The aim is to develop a flexible national strategy, which assimilates the vast knowledge and practical experiences from within the water and sanitation sector.
When the strategy is finalised it will be implemented by the local authorities that provide sanitation services.

Easter Wishes from Premier Rasool
13 April 2006
SOURCE: Premier of the Western Cape (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
Easter is the holiest time of the religious year for our Christian sisters and brothers.
It is a time rich in spiritual symbolism and tradition dating back to the earliest commemorations of the capture, trial, death and resurrection of Jesus.
The build up to Easter starts on Ash Wednesday when ash from the palms used in the previous year's Palm Sunday procession is applied in the sign of the cross on the foreheads of Christians as a mark of penance.
The 40 day period between Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday is called Lent and is observed as a time of self denial and spiritual learning.
On Palm Sunday Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem is remembered, when crowds of poor people proclaimed him an earthly King and waved palms of welcome.
Jesus was condemned to death by crucifixion by the religious and political leaders of the day.
He carried his own cross to the Place of the Skull on the outskirts of the city where he was crucified with two thieves on Good Friday.
Churches are stripped bare of ornaments at this time to rep resent the absence of Jesus.
Christians remember the 'Seven Words of the Cross' and supernatural events of Good Friday with prayer vigils.
A great sadness at Jesus' sacrifice to reconcile humanity to God prevails.
Traditionally, hot cross buns which signify the crucifixion are served on Good Friday.
On Easter Sunday however, Mary Magdalene's discovery of the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus from the dead is cause for great celebration and thanksgiving.
Easter eggs are exchanged to symbolize the empty tomb.
I wish all who will travel this spiritual journey of Jesus a time of great meaning and growth.
Jesus is respected and loved by so many religions and teaches us that we gain much more by investing in a better future than seeking glory for a day.

2. How to Recycle Waste
3. What Paper Can I Recycle?
4. What Glass Can I Recycle?
5. Recycling Metal
6. Recycling Plastic
7. How to Recycle Electronic Waste
This will explain what paper, plastic, metal and glass can be recycled.
Not all domestic waste products are suitable for recycling.
This is a guide to help you decide what to take to your nearest domestic recycling drop-off depot, and what should go in the rubbish bin.
Not all domestic recycling drop-off points accept every kind of all recycling materials.
It is best to call ahead to find out what you can bring and check the hours of operation as they may change from time to time.
a. Rinse
Wash and dry any food and beverage containers such as wine bottles, food tins and beer cans.
Don't throw your recyclable materials into the dustbin thinking you'll fish them out later.
Rather have a separate bin (or bag) each for paper, glass, metal and plastic and throw the waste directly in it.
c. Drop off
When your glass, paper, metal and plastic bags are full, drop them off at the Recycling Depot that's closest to you.
Each depot has its own system for drop-offs: some depots have demarcated areas for certain materials, while others have people on site to help you sort your waste.
If you're uncertain, call ahead to ask.
3. Recycling Paper and Cardboard
The following types of paper can be recycled:
* White office paper
* Magazines and books (glossy magazines and inserts printed on glossy paper are recyclable, as long as nothing is laminated)
* Newspaper
* Corrugated cardboard
The following may not be recycled.
* NO laminated or waxy paper (such as that often found in boxes used for tomatoes or bananas)
* NO waxy paper ream wrappers
* NO tetrapacks (fruit juice and milk containers that seem to be made out of paper, but are lined with foil and plastic)
* NO punch confetti
* NO carbon paper
* NO stickers
4. Recycling Glass
The following glass can be recycled:
* Wine bottles
* Food jars (used for jam, mayonnaise, tomato sauce etc)
* Light bulbs, sheet glass, mirrors and Pyrex can be recycled, but should be stored separately as they are made of a different kind of glass
Note: Rinse out and dry bottles containing the remains of foodstuffs and beverages.
You can leave paper labels on the glass.
The following metal can be recycled but note items with asterisk
* Aluminium cooldrink cans
* Food tins (these should be rinsed.
It helps if you remove the paper label, too)
* Lids of glass containers
* Aluminium foil and foil packaging
* Small metal items (such as staples, paperclips)
* Paint and aerosol cans (leave labels on the cans as their contents are viewed as hazardous and recyclers need to know what was in them)
* Old car body parts*
* Rusty garden furniture*
* Non-ferrous metals (anything made out of copper, aluminium, brass, stainless steel)*
*NOTE: Very few recycling depots accept these metal items.
Call ahead to make sure.
The following plastic can be recycled:
* Food and beverage containers (hard plastic as used containers for ice cream, milk, juice, bottled water, soft drinks, milk, butter and margarine)
* Household cleaner containers (hard plastic such as that used for cleaners such as Handy Andy, bleach, dishwashing liquid, fabric softener)
* Plastic bags (soft plastic such as that used to wrap magazines, six-packs of beer or packs of toilet paper)
NO cling-wrap can be recycled.
7. Recycling Electronic Waste

In the Western Cape, a liquor licence is required by any person who is micro-manufacturing or selling liquor for retail purposes.
In the Western Cape a "retail seller" is a person who is licensed in terms of the Liquor Act 27 of 1989 to sell liquor for the purposes of consumption (includes consumption on the licensed premises and consumption off the licensed premises).
The Western Cape Liquor Board is the public entity which considers applications and makes decisions with regard to applications, while the Directorate: Liquor Regulation oversees the administrative as well as compliance and enforcement aspects of the Liquor Act.
If you are a manufacturer, or distributor you are required to register with the National Liquor Authority.
It is a criminal offence to sell liquor without a licence and the South African Police Service can take steps against such a person and close down the business.

Bursaries in Environmental Studies and Town & Regional Planning
1. Which Bursaries does the Provincial Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning offer?
The Provincial Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning offers about five bursaries each year for full-time studies in fields where there is a shortage of skills.
In 2006, for example, there were bursaries for environmental studies and town and regional planning.

Booker Prize winning novelist, John Berger, writes about Antonio Gramsci and defines his most unique and enduring capacity in the following manner:
The least dogmatic of our century's thinkers about revolution was Antonio Gramsci.
His lack of dogmatism came from a kind of patience.
He saw close-up, and sometimes directed the political struggles of his time, but he never forgot the background of an unfolding drama whose span covers incalculable ages.
It was perhaps this which prevented Gramsci becoming, like many revolutionaries, a millennialist.
He believed in hope rather than promises and hope is a long affair.1
This sensibility underpins President Thabo Mbeki's assertion that South Africa is in its Age of Hope, and the Western Cape Province's Hope, that we are on the Threshold of Prosperity.
This Hope is neither transcendental nor sentimental, but founded on patience and endless human practice.
It locates each one of us within an unfolding human drama in which we shun both dogmatism and complacency.
Our role in the drama is taking shape.
When I delivered my first budget speech for the Department of the Premier in 2004, we set out to respond to the challenge of building a Modern African State by laying the philosophical foundations of the state as developmental.
We understood that to depart from the kind of state that the Desai Commission warned us about was to orient the state towards achieving the objectives of the National Programme of Action and the Millennium Development Goals for our Province.
I proposed to you then the blueprint of a state that was integrated in itself, cooperative in its relations with other spheres of government, responsive to its citizens and partners, and globally-connected for its relevance.
In my 2005 Budget Speech for the Department of the Premier I warned that the path towards a Development State would require deep transformation.
I proposed a process that would see the reengineering of the Centre of the State, in which that Centre would gather together a skills set, drawn from the best of those inside and outside of the Administration, capable of giving leadership, setting the policy agenda and driving the implementation of the strategy.
Mr Speaker, in my third Budget Speech as Premier, I can report to this House that we have achieved both sets of objectives, and we are now ready to clarify the next scene of the unfolding drama of building and rewarding the Hope that Antonio Gramsci speaks about.
We in this Province are not alone in this unfolding drama.
We are part of a global concern that seeks to consolidate hope by defining a Shared Growth path - that which we call iKapa elihlumayo - and building social cohesion while nurturing diversity - what we envision as a Home for All.
Recently I was invited to join a gathering of progressive world leaders convened by President Mbeki at the Progressive Governance Summit precisely because what we are doing in this Province resonates with the hopes of the world to find a path to social justice, economic equity and a way of living together in the face of terrorism, intolerance and marginalisation.
Endless human practice, as Gramsci would have told such world leaders, would insist that the path to such a future is based on analysis, planning and strategy.
Analysis, planning and strategy draw from the global to the local and inform from the local to the global.
PGDS: The Foundation Stone of Prosperity
In the context of South Africa, our Province is required to fashion a Provincial Growth and Development Strategy (PGDS) out of the National Spatial Development Perspective and, in turn, ensure that the Integrated Development Plans of all local governments are in this single image.
This ensures both coherence and allows us all to work tangibly to create a better life for all our people.
Last year Minister Mufamadi's department published guidelines on what a PGDS is.
According to the Guidelines,
The PGDS is based on a long-term view of the province's development trajectory.
Drawing on the NSDP and the MTSF and working within a sustainable development paradigm, the primary purpose of the PGDS is to provide a collaborative framework to drive implementation within the province.
It is not a provincial government plan, but a developmental framework for the province as a whole.
We are about to finalise what we think this developmental framework for the Western Cape is.
It will be the raison'dêtre of my department and this government.
According to renowned planning theorist, Prof Patsy Healey, it will introduce the most radical and far-reaching changes seen in terms of the approach we have adopted.
She argues that:
...strategy-making is a process of deliberative paradigm change.
It aims to change cultural conceptions, systems of understanding and systems meaning.
It is more than just producing collective decisions.
It is about shifting and re-shaping convictions.3
At the heart of the PGDS is the paradigm of shared growth and integrated development.
As we proceed to engage our social partners and the citizenry at large over the next few months, I believe we will be able to make this development paradigm hegemonic, not least because its seeds have already been sown by the iKapa Elihlumayo processes that have unfolded over the past few years, including the Growth and Development Summit of 2003.
The PGDS argues that in the context of massive unemployment, perverse income inequalities, deep social divides and the potential marginalisation of our national economy from the global economy, our priority must be the achievement of much higher rates of growth as the springboard for dealing with the range of intractable challenges we face.
Higher rates of growth on their own are not sufficient; it is the nature of growth that is critical.
We must ensure that higher rates of growth are combined with greater social equity that will enable the poor and economically excluded to gain the means to participate in the economy and build their own sources of empowerment, combined with effective protection of the natural resource base of the province.
Lastly, growth must not worsen spatial apartheid and inefficiencies, as it has in the first decade of freedom.
It must make life more convenient and affordable for the majority of our people who are desperate to access economic, social and ecological opportunities.
The PGDS - iKapa elihlumayo - sets out how our Province will achieve a shared growth and integrated development path.
Following the logic of acupuncture, it will entail more targeted action, more strategic investment, better leadership and greater effectiveness and co-operation from government in the Western Cape.
The PGDS is the further evolution of that which has already been brought to this House in the form of the eight iKapa elihlumayo strategies: Spatial Development, Social Capital, Human Capital, Micro-Economic, Strategic Infrastructure, and the three Governance Strategies.
These will now need refocusing so that, in turn, they achieve the practical objectives I set out in my State of the Province Address earlier this year as the Battle Plan for Shared Growth.
They are, by way of reminder:
* economic participation;
* infrastructure that connects;
* effective public transport;
* sustainable integrated human settlements;
* resilient communities;
* a culture of tolerance, respect and engagement; and
* effective governance institutions.
However, the global and national targets we have been set for 2014, require even greater levels of galvanisation and harnessing of energies, resources and talents.
This, therefore, means the immediate pursuit of five path breaking interventions, all of which are germane to any growth path, some of which needed work from a long time ago, and others which have emerged as urgent either because we face a moment of crisis or opportunity.
These are the five interventions which cabinet has grappled with and which needs urgent implementation.
Public Transport
Firstly, addressing the crisis in Public Transport that serves as a brake on the economy, social engagement, community safety and environmental integrity.
I believe that if there is only one success this PGDS achieves, it must be the turn-around of the state of public transport.
Concretely, we have potentially achieved an important milestone to find additional sources of revenue to invest in transport infrastructure through the provisional approval of the proposed fuel levy for the Western Cape.
The Finance and Fiscal Commission has indicated that we are on the right path in supplementing our revenue base and our feasibility research is sound.
This is a major breakthrough after four years.
Of course we endorse their call for deeper consultation.
World Cup 2010
Secondly, maximising the opportunities surrounding the 2010 World Cup in terms of growing tourism and related sectors of our regional economy, promoting healthy lifestyles choices amongst the youth and kick-starting urgently needed infrastructure investments to improve the flow of people and goods.
This ambition has been given renewed impetus by the agreement we recently achieved between the Mayor and myself that the establishment of a special purpose vehicle must be expedited through provincial legislation.
Furthermore, the national meeting we attended with the LOC has cemented the resolve to host the World Cup at a new Green Point Stadium.
In light of these encouraging developments, I am convinced that the World Cup build-up and legacy will greatly enhance our development ambitions for the province.
It is now time for all of us in the province to unite behind efforts for World Cup 2010 and ensure that we do indeed host an event that will firmly lodge the Western Cape in the world's mind as a must-see place.
The Cape soccer fraternity is already enthusiastic as big crowds viewed Santos and Hanover Park recently.
Even Vasco da Gama put up a spirited victorious performance against Bush Bucks over the weekend.
Our Energy Supply
Thirdly, the energy wake-up call we received recently in the Western Cape is a potential threat to higher rates of economic growth over the medium-term.
However, higher rates of investment in energy also create an opportunity to pursue a more diversified portfolio of energy technologies which can position the Western Cape to grow the size of its environmental industries.
In this regard great progress is being made through the planned investments by Eskom that have been brought forward.
The latter initiative introduces the debate in this Province on the source of energy for such a base station.
The transport of coal is expensive and the gas supplies are not yet reliable.
The nuclear energy debate is one all of us must participate in.
Skills Development
Fourthly, fixing the serious skills mismatch between what the regional economy needs and what comes onto the labour market from the education system has become the main disjuncture in our society and economy, fuelling inequality.
This matter is beginning to receive priority attention and our Province is leading through the R70m recapitalisation of our FET Colleges underpinned by a R25m loan scheme.
The establishment of focus schools responding to the variety of skills needs in the province similarly path-breaking.
Only last week saw the opening of an Engineering Focus School in Mitchell's Plain, and planning for Institutes for Contemporary Music responds to the Western Cape emerging strongly as a creative centre in the country.
Finally, the Western Cape's Asgisa project - The Cape Flats Renewal Programme - must come to fruition as the whole country rallies behind this extraordinary intervention to ratchet up growth through, primarily, infrastructure-driven programmes.
Given that this intervention coincides spatially where the majority of poor people reside in the province, it is also appropriate that it is part of the highest priorities of the PGDS.
Our draft PGDS will be unveiled next month for public engagement.
It is fully compliant with the following sentiment in the PGDS Guidelines:
The PGDS is the core alignment mechanism for the province and it should be seen as the coordination and implementation strategy.
While driven by the province and championed by the Premier, this must be on the basis of a collaborative effort that brings all parties to the table.
Given that we are advanced in our province towards a PGDS, I now want to turn to the implementation vehicles we will have to establish and overhaul to implement our development strategy for the Province.
Implementation Frameworks and Institutional Vehicles
The PGDS is fundamentally about coordination, alignment and integration across provincial government departments, between spheres of government between different state bodies and between government and its social partners.
Improved Cabinet System
This will work only with a strong policy centre at the heart of government.
This requires a more focused Cabinet that can systematically drive the strategy agenda of iKapa elihlumayo as it cascades into the priorities and actions of all actors in the province.
In this context we inaugurated the new, more strategically focused, Cabinet system which sees the introduction of an implementation orientated and alignment-focussed approach.
A Policy Centre in Government
The new Cabinet system is underpinned by a much more coherent policy centre in government.
The reengineering process of my department has now brought into being a formidable policy team at the centre of government.
In its establishment and operationalisation, the new policy nerve centre in my Department will work hand-in-glove with the economic and budgetary policy analysis capacity in Provincial Treasury and the team of municipal analysts in the Department of Housing and Local Government.
Already, the three entities have learnt to work together and hone their skills in the development so far of the PGDS.
Inter-Governmental Relations
Our Cabinet system and the policy capacity has been timed to anticipate what, over the last year, has been a veritable revolution in inter-governmental relations and planning in South Africa, consolidated by the Inter-Governmental Relations Act of 2005.
On the basis of the IGR Act, the President's Coordinating Council has become the supreme forum for driving an aligned agenda of delivery across the spheres of government.
The agenda of the PCC is the priorities spelled out in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework and the National Spatial Development Perspective, which are largely translated into the National Programme of Action.
It is assumed that all Provinces and Municipalities must reflect the implications of the National Programme of Action in their respective development agendas (PGDS and IDPs).
I am compelled by the IGR Act to use the Premier's Coordinating Forum (PCF) to ensure exactly such alignment.
Thus, in the following year we will see much greater emphasis being placed on strong and meaningful inter-governmental planning and engagement in the province, based on the NSDP and the PGDS.
In light of the political fragility in many municipalities in the province, I am determined to use the instruments of the IGR Act to engender calm and stability and ensure a focus on service delivery so that we can all work single-mindedly to achieve the strategic goals of the PGDS, iKapa elihlumayo.
Just because we have local governments governed by coalitions, with the ongoing prospects of changes as coalitions may change, does not mean that the public should suffer through inefficiencies, poor service delivery or political brinkmanship.
The PCF will drive co-ordination of the activities of government, national departments, state owned enterprises and special purpose agencies that operate in the province to engage on the unique regional dynamics of the Western Cape so that these are appropriately reflected and accommodated in national policy frameworks, programmes, projects and funding protocols, as well as monitor the cumulative impact of development in the Western Cape as we proceed with accelerated delivery.
Three New Planning Regions
The Provincial Spatial Development Framework alerted us last year to the geographical way in which our populations are moving, and in which economic opportunities are concentrating, and its impact on the natural resource base of the province.
If these factors are going to be key drivers for the implementation of the PGDS, then political boundaries may not be the most useful way in which to conceive of development planning for Shared Growth.
If anything, shared growth and integrated development would have a geographical logic that would cross the political boundaries of municipalities.
What is emerging at this stage are three Development Planning Regions.
The Premier's Coordinating Forum would soon have to discuss formalising these Regions to facilitate appropriate growth and development to coordinate better and harness expenditure and investment more intelligently.
The Cape Town Functional Region, including Saldanha, Paarl, Worcester, Stellenbosch and parts of the Overberg, if we plan its future together will harness some of the most productive industrial resources of the Province and consolidate itself as our economic powerhouse.
Already, 85% of general value added in the provincial economy comes from this area.
The South Cape urban strip from Plettenberg Bay to Mossel Bay is showing remarkable growth potential which requires coordinated planning and appropriately targeted and sequenced investments.
This today, is a bold debate we want to open up so that we can best ensure the future of all our people and the quickest way to reach our growth and development targets.
Partnerships: Investment leveraging
This means that we need stronger relationships with the business community, but not only in the Province.
The Western Cape is facing increasing competition from products we have traditionally exported and we are having to see off fierce challenges from countries like New Zealand (in film) and India (in business process outsourcing).
However, the goodwill towards us is so great that significant global, national and domestic business leaders are keen to serve us in an advisory capacity.
Such an Advisory Panel will be convened towards the end of the year as a platform from which we can improve economic performance and reach our growth targets.
Partnerships: Higher Education Engagement
One of the distinct comparative advantages of the Western Cape is that we have four Universities based here, as well as the large footprint of Unisa.
Yet we have been slow in harnessing this invaluable resource.
We have convened all the Vice-Chancellors late last year to discuss how we can partner to each other's mutual advantage.
Since then there has been a series of close interactions with the Cape Higher Education Consortium (CHEC), which represents the Universities, to work towards a Joint Programme of Action for Shared Growth in the province.
This work will culminate in a Provincial Government-Higher Education Institutions Summit later this year.
At the Summit we will adopt a Cooperation Agreement that will facilitate alignment between the priorities of the Universities and our Scarce Skills Strategies for the realisation of our Ikapa elihlumayo strategies.
Partnerships: The Provincial Development Council
Strategic partnerships with key investors and the universities complement the institutionalised, partnership-based, social dialogue partners in the PDC.
During 2006 we will focus our engagements on the PGDS.
This process will involve an extensive array of engagements with all segments of society so that we can build a vibrant democratic foundation for a consensus on, and the implementation of, our shared growth and integrated development agenda.
The priorities and monitoring indicators of the PGDS will also enhance the work of the PDC because engagements will be based on budgetary priorities and departmental actions.
Capacity of the State to Drive the Shared Growth Battle Plan
All our objectives, strategies and partnerships will come to naught unless we can address the capacity of the State.
We have been working at this challenge in a radical and systematic fashion since the first day that I took office.
I am finally in a position to report considerable progress on this front.
On the 1 April 2006 the new, fully reengineered Department of the Premier came into being.
Since then the new, representative and highly qualified leadership of the Department has begun their work.
Over two thirds of the new SMS have post-graduate qualifications reflecting the diverse and deep skills base we sought to attract.
They bring with them many years of experience in both the Public and Private sector.
Their strengths span generic areas such as in personnel, finance, legal and IT management, but also the skills related to policy development, implementation and review.
They will bring to government a capacity for full policy coherence and alignment through the lens of the PGDS.
They will give leadership in a series of human and social capital interventions to address the skills, orientation, behavioural and management capacities of the Administration to ensure effective implementation of the Shared Growth agenda.
The new SMS is also broadly representative of the provincial demographics of the labour force in the Western Cape.
We have now filled 46 out of 53 posts.
Of the 46, 31% is African, 45% Coloured and 24% White.
Of the 46 posts we have improved the representation of women from 9% in 2004 to 33% so far.
Where we need drastic action across government is in the representivity of people with disabilities.
These demographic figures represent a fundamental break with the skewed and exclusionary patterns that I inherited two years ago, especially where we only had a single African person in the SMS.
In the remaining appointments we will seek to improve even further on the representation of especially Coloured people and women without being overly mechanical.
In Conclusion
Mr Speaker, the core of this third budget speech of mine as Premier revolved around the PGDS increasingly realising a Shared Prosperity for the Western Cape.
That this is more possible is so only because we have done some of the hard work of deep institutional transformation in this Province.
Yet, even as we speak here today, the urgency of what we must still do echoes all over this Province.
The lives of many are still defined by poverty, unemployment, violence, and pathologies which emerge therefrom.
There are daily battles between ordinary citizens and their instruments like the police on the one hand, and forces who believe that the conditions of poverty give them the right to conduct themselves unlawfully and illegally.
I refer here to gangsters and druglords, but also refer to those who initially earned our sympathy because they do the dangerous work of protecting us for very little remuneration.
But in the course of a legal strike for legitimate objectives, they have conducted themselves in a way that makes us even wonder whether they can be trusted to be the custodians of what we regard as precious in our Province.
I have no doubt that, led by the police, we will continue to protect our leaders, our citizens, our commuters and our prosperity against any acts of illegality.
Mr Speaker, over the past while, our vision of making this Province a Home for All has been seriously challenged.
The run up to the Local Government elections have reversed some of the racial harmony and social cohesion we have sought to build.
The outcomes of the elections and the existence of unstable coalitions have begun to threaten some of the hard-won stability achieved in this Province.
Most significantly, we see the spectre of polarisation, exclusion and division in the Western Cape.
Does this mean that the vision of a Home for All has failed and is unworkable?
When Chief Albert Luthuli first verbalised this vision, it was met with three decades of absolute state brutality.
Adopting the sensibility of Gramsci that hope is a long affair, we simply need to be more tenacious and work harder to realise the vision of a Home for All.
The year 2006 allows us two significant opportunities to give impetus to our vision of a Home for All.
Together with the rest of the country, June will see us celebrating the courage, and commemorating the sacrifices, made by the youth in 1976.
The Western Cape Youth Commission together with government and youth formations are planning a month of activities that will honour the past, but will lay the foundations of unity for the future.
Similarly, we will celebrate fifty years of the march by women to the Union Buildings, not simply displaying their displeasure as women with Apartheid, but forever laying down their right to be equal citizens, fully integrated into our society.
In both these celebrations, the Provincial Government Departments are hard at work to deliver concretely to youth and women that which I undertook as part of our Siyabulela Campaign.
I now call upon this House and the citizens and organisations of this Province to nominate those - either departed or still living - from the ranks of youth and women, who they believe are worthy of the highest honours that the Western Cape can bestow on its citizens so that we can elevate their example and hold them up as the symbols of our freedom and unity, and the architects of our Home for All.

Art in Business Project
To promote the cultural industries in the Western Cape by supporting local artists.
THE WORLD OF WORK IN THE WESTERN CAPE
Click on each image for more detail
For more artworks by these and other South African artists, visit www.saart.co.za.
The Department of Economic Development and Tourism launched the Art DÉcor Project also known as Art in Business, to give artists in the Western Cape a platform to market their products during 2005.
The project is seen as an important initiative in developing the creative arts and cultural industries in a very practical way.
Artists from the Western Cape had to capture "The World of Work in the Western Cape".
Scenes depicting survivalist enterprises, small businesses and people working in formal organisations were submitted.
The paintings had to be in acrylic or oil on hard board or canvas and had to measure 60 cm wide and 40 cm deep.
Short-listed applicants underwent a screening process.
The paintings had to be completed within two weeks from the date of appointment.
The Department intends building a collection of paintings over a period of time.
Details of the artists are made available to enable potential purchasers to contact the artists directly.
Members of the group of artists exhibited at the Tourism Showcase (2005), Small Business Week (2005) and at the ArtsCape Marble Foyer, ArtsCape, Cape Town in March 2006 during the Cape Town Festival.
The Department entered the works of 20 artists based in the Western Cape for POSITIVE 2006.
Comments from the Artists
Velile Soha developed an interest in art from a young age.
He studied drawing, sculpturing, photography, painting, graphics and history of art.
As full-time artist, Velile's works featured in several solo and group exhibitions across South Africa, Namibia, the USA and Europe.
“My aim is to show outside communities how my people lives their lives,” says Velile.
Robert Thembinkosi from Zwelethemba, Worcester, studied fine art during the 1980's.
He has exhibited locally and internationally.
Robert also writes poetry and short stories.
“I paint murals, banners and signboards and teach the children in Zwelethemba (the secrets) of fine art,” says Robert.
Raymond Lawrence is from Arniston.
He is unmodified by formal art school and started by drawing local scenes while still at school.
“I paint Kassiesbaai and other scenes exclusively from memory, rather than being at the scene,” he says.

THE STORY BEHIND RED DOOR
Around the world, small businesses are a big part of the economy.
In developed countries small businesses contribute up to 60%to GDP; in South Africa, small businesses only contribute about 35% to GDP.
Part of the reason for this is that compared to many similar developing countries like Brazil and India, the survival rate of small businesses in South Africa has been low.
So has the level of entrepreneurship.
Small business support services are badly needed; but historically, these have often been fragmented.
In some areas there has been a lot of duplication of services, while in others, especially in the rural areas, there have been no support services at all.
The RED Door advice centres have been established to co-ordinate support services and make sure they are easily available, when and where they are needed.

Status Report on African Horse Sickness
23 May 2006
Almost six weeks ago the fact that cases of African Horse Sickness were detected in the Worcester and Robertson districts of the Western Cape Province was made public.
To ensure that the public is kept informed about the status of this disease outbreak the present situation is outlined below.
The disease has been diagnosed on six properties in the Breede River valley on the border between the Worcester and Robertson districts.
The diagnosis has been confirmed through virus isolation and identification procedures performed on samples taken from horses that died.
The test result from a seventh property is still awaited.
In total eighteen horses showed clinical signs of the disease and of these eight have died and two were put down.
* The disease has not spread beyond a radius of about fifteen kilometres from the property where the first case was found and has remained within the Breede valley, where conditions are more suitable for the midges transmitting the disease.
* During the last two weeks the number of new cases has been less than the new cases detected during the two previous weeks.
It however remains very important that the control measures, introduced at the start of the outbreak, must remain in place.
The following control measures regarding the movement of horses, mules, donkeys and zebras are still applicable:
The widespread occurrence of the disease in other parts of the country does not allow for any relaxing of this restriction.
2. The following restrictions on the movement of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras, within or through the Worcester and Robertson districts, also remain in place:
1.
The movement of such animals between individual properties within the magisterial districts of Worcester and Robertson of the Western Cape Province may not take place.
2.
Horses from outside the surveillance zone may only move into the surveillance and free zones if they meet all the requirements specified in the protocol that has been in effect since 1997.
Because the disease has become widespread in the rest of the country, few if any, horses are expected to meet these requirements at present.
Their movement through the Worcester district will be on the following conditions:
Movement permits must be obtained from the State Veterinarian in the area from where the animals are moving before horses are transported.
The necessary notification of the movement must be done prior to departure.
Vehicles transporting horses may only travel on the N1 highway through the Worcester district and may not turn off the N1 within Worcester magisterial district.
The Worcester district stretches from Konstabel railway station (about halfway between Touwsrivier and Matjiesfontein) in the north up to the Rawsonville turnoff at the entrance to Du Toitskloof pass in the South.
Along this route vehicles transporting horses may not stop for any protracted period of time and no horses may be up- or offloaded along this stretch of road.
3.
The transport of such animals along the N1 in the Worcester magisterial district may only take place during daylight between the hours of 08H00 and 17H00.
4.
Horseboxes or trailers must be sprayed with insecticides and insect repellents before animals are loaded for transit through the Worcester magisterial district.
Owners of horses are again reminded of the measures that can be taken to prevent their animals from contracting the disease:
* Vaccinate all horses according to the directions for AHS vaccine.
It may be prudent to vaccinate younger foals, even if they have to be revaccinated within another few months.
* Where possible horses should be stabled from late afternoon to mid-morning.
* Keep horses out of low lying or marshy camps from late afternoon to mid-morning
* Apply insect repellents and insecticides suitable for horses, particularly where animals cannot be stabled
On behalf of the Western Cape Department of Agriculture, I want to express appreciation for the cooperation of all parties concerned in assisting with implementing effective control measures.

Highlights from the City Budget as approved at the special Council Meeting of the City of Cape Town on 31 May 2006.
Mayor Zille aims for 8% growth
The Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town, Helen Zille, has tabled a record R17,2 billion budget to support economic growth and social development for 2006/07.
The capital budget amounts to R3 bn and the operating budget totals R14,2bn.
The rates and tariff increases are below the inflation rate of 5,2%.
Mayor Zille declared the City's intent to work toward a sustainable growth level of around 6 to 8%.
Handicap and Retirement Rebates Increased
One of the changes to the budget is an increased rebate for handicapped and retired persons.
The rebate has been increased to accommodate people with an income up to a maximum of R3 000 per month.
The rest of the social spending in the budget remained unchanged.
A total of R385 million has been allocated for a range of free basic services including water, sewage and electricity.
This allocation is over and above the rates exemption for some 100 000 properties in the City that are valued at less than R50 000.
Rates and Tariff Increases Below Inflation Rate
The City government believes it can boost its income through improved revenue collection systems.
The main tariff increases are as follows:
* Rates, refuse removal and sanitation will go up by 5%.
* Water will increase by 7% of which 4% goes towards the new Berg River Dam project.
* Electricity goes up by 4,9%
Ward Allocation Increased by R100 000
Every City ward will receive R100 000 more than anticipated in the draft budget.
Each of the City's 105 wards will now receive R400 000 for community projects, of which R200 000 will be for capital projects and R200 000 for operational expenditure.
R240 Million Infrastructure Injection
Major additional infrastructure expenditure has been proposed in the new City Budget.
An amount of R75 million has been allocated for Transport, Roads and Stormwater infrastructure, a contingency of R125 million for 2010 Soccer World Cup projects and a further R100 million for the World Cup over the coming two financial years.
R40 Million for Safety And Security
Mayor Zille announced an additional capital allocation for the Metro Police and the City's Emergency Services.
The Metro Police will get an extra R9,5 million to strengthen their capacity to enforce the law whilst Emergency Services is to receive an additional R6,5 million on top of the R31 million which was announced earlier this year.
Eight Steps to make the Budget Work Better
Mayor Zille has proposed eight steps to make the City Budget work better:
* Increasing project management capacity and driving projects decisively
* Initiating tender processes earlier in the financial year
* Amending supply chain management policy to speed up delivery
* Opening up of tender processes to public and media
* Introducing a Standing Committee on Public Accounts
* Taking steps to speed up the tender process
* Improving performance management systems
* Filling critical posts

Statement on World Health Day
7 April 2006
"This year's theme for World Health Day, 'Working together for health', highlights the critical role played by our health workers, and the importance of working together to achieve the best outcomes for our patients ", Minister Uys said at a gathering of health workers in George.
"Health workers are the heartbeat of health care in our province.
They are the men and women who fulfil their duties selflessly, often under difficult circumstances", Uys said.
These workers include dentists, nurses and midwives, pharmacists, home-based carers, technicians,cooks,cleaners and the whole spectrum of health workers.
With reference to the shortage of health workers in the Western Cape and the tremendous pressure under which health workers have to cope, Minister Uys said his department focuses on all health care workers, the challenges they face on a day-to-day basis, and the need for management to understand, support and address their concerns.
Some of the steps that are being taken include:
* filling vacant positions, where possible;
* training more health workers;
* providing more bursaries;
* expanding support structures such as home-based care;
* providing scarce skills allowances and other incentives; and
* creating better work environments through revitalisation and maintenance programmes.
"Furthermore it is important that the broader community shows more appreciation for our health workers, and does not take them for granted", Uys said.
"The role that our health workers play in rendering an accessible, sustainable, quality and cost-effective health service is critical for the well-being of the people of the Western Cape.
A healthy province is a happy province ", he said.
Health facilities across the province will celebrate World Health Day on 7 April.
Open days are planned at all facilities, and communities will be invited to come and see for themselves what a day in the life of a health worker entails by taking them through the whole service spectrum, from when patients come through the security gates until the time they collect their medication and leave.
"With the support of our health care workers, volunteers, community workers, health forums and home-based carers, we will be able to render the quality services that are expected from us", Uys said.
"The Western Cape government is proud of its health care workers, and will do everything in its power to support them in rendering their crucial service.

New Oncology Equipment Installed on the Eve of World Cancer Day
3 February 2006
The acquisition of a new R 3,2 million Oncology Afterloader, installed at the Tygerberg Hospital, is celebrated on the eve of World Cancer Day on 4 February.
"We continuously update and improve our cancer services because cancer patients often still have many fruitful years ahead if they receive special treatment.
Our Provincial Cancer control programme is aimed at doing just that" he said.
In the Western Cape, as elsewhere in South Africa, childhood cancer makes up 2% of all cancers reported.
In South Africa one in four males and one in five females between 0 and 74 years is at risk of developing cancer.
About 7 000 new cancer cases are expected to be reported in the Western Cape alone this year.
This is up by one thousand from five years ago.
Tygerberg and Groote Schuur Hospitals treat 70% of these cases..
Our provincial cancer control programme is aimed at erasing the shortfall with a pronged approach which includes:
1. Health promotion as a primary prevention measure
2. Early detection
3. Diagnosis and treatment
4. Palliative care
5. Hospice/step-down care centers for de-institutionalised patients
6. Home based care
"The provincial health department is concentrating on several remaining challenges which include poor access to treatment centers in rural areas, the development of standardized treatment protocols and staffing norms, human resource shortages and a population based cancer register" Minister Uys said.
He also praised his dedicated and professional staff for the sterling job they are doing in treating our patients with expertise and compassion.

16 December 2005
Thank you very much, Vuyo Mbuli.
I want to acknowledge Ministers Trevor Manuel and Marthinus van Schalkwyk, and thank them very much for joining us on this day; the Nobel Laureates or their representatives, Members of the Provincial Government and the Legislature, members of the Diplomatic Corps, leaders of society in South Africa, the Western Cape and Cape Town, citizens of Cape Town and South Africa, thank you very much for joining us on this day.
December the 16th is Reconciliation Day.
It is a day which, more than ten years ago, would have been remembered and celebrated differently.
There were those who saw it as the day of the vow because of a particular episode in history.
There were those who saw it as Dingani's Day because of an episode in history.
There were those who saw it as the birth of Umkhonto weSizwe because of an episode in history.
There were those who had other ideas about what happened on December the 16th.
And it was, for the last ten years, our day in which to reconcile all the different conceptions and histories and understandings we have of what happened in South Africa; to reconcile it all and call December the 16th, the Day of Reconciliation.
I think it is that, that brings us all together today, particularly in Cape Town, but all over the country.
Today is the unveiling of Freedom Park for the nation.
That is where the State President is.
We are hoping that this Nobel Square that we are unveiling today, will be the Freedom Park of the Western Cape.
We'll be able to respond to our ambitions and aspirations for reconciliation in a very special way.
The Western Cape has also been asked to commence on this day, a week of reflection on particularly our slave history.
And we have done so with performances at the Baxter such as Vuma, we are doing so on Sunday in Genadendal by bringing to mind fourteen outstanding figures out of that slave era - whether they were slaves or whether they were abolitionists; whether they were freed slaves or whether they were of the Xhosa communities who gave sanctuary to slaves.
And so I think that this day becomes not only a day of plastering over those divisions of the past, but going into the history of the past so that we all understand who we are, look each other in the eye and be able to say: "This is who I am.
I want to relate to you.
I want to embrace what is common between us, and I want to appreciate what is different between us."
And I think that this is what reconciliation means for us today.
We are all familiar with the gold that we export, we are familiar with the fruits that we export, we are familiar with the wines that we export, and so many other things that we export.
And that's a massive resource that we must have.
Who will ever forget the contribution of an Archbishop Desmond Tutu who, in the 1970's and the 1980's and through to the 1990's stood out as someone who articulated the pain of our nation, whether he led the march in front, whether he presided over funerals of our youth, or whether he visited the pain of so many people who suffered under apartheid?
Who will ever forget Archbishop Desmond Tutu exhorting our people, not only to struggle, but to higher levels of morality in that struggle as he sometimes stood between the instincts of our people to do horrible things to those who did horrible things to them?
And he stood between them.
Who will ever forget that?
Who will ever forget that Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed at a very critical moment in our history our yearning to be one, our yearning to be united as a people when he said that we are the rainbow nation of God?
That is what, amongst other things, made Archbishop Desmond Tutu stand out as a symbol of what we want to be as a nation.
Similarly, there are moments which define FW de Klerk.
The seminal moment probably is when he grabbed power from PW Botha who could not cross that Rubicon and he instead picked up the (indistinct).
The moment of joy when all our hearts surged across the country when he unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, when he freed Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.
And we knew at that moment that that which we had been struggling for was eminently possible, at that moment.
That moment when he transcended his own history, his own party, his own people, to start a process of negotiating a better future for all our people.
Those are the things, which have earned him some of the accolades that the world has been able to give.
Who will be able to forget Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, his twenty-seven years in prison in the Western Cape, in Cape Town?
When he could not be with us but yet was such a powerful presence amongst us.
When he could not speak to us, but spoke to us in such inspirational ways that kept us believing that the future was going to be better than the present.
That Nelson Mandela, who could not march with us, but led us in decisive ways that kept us going forward to this moment of victory and, this moment of peace and this moment of glory that South Africa experiences in the world.
He epitomized everything that was good, that was noble and dignified, not only in our struggle but also in our people, who transformed concepts like reconciliation, forgiveness, co-existence from its original conceptions of weakness, compromise and defeat, and made them such powerful words that resonate even today across the world.
That is what Nelson Mandela has been able to do to us.
Chief Albert Luthuli, in his autobiography says, and I quote: "The task is not finished.
South Africa is not yet a home for all her sons and daughters.
Such a home we wish to ensure.
From the beginning our history has been one of ascending unities, the breaking of tribal, racial and creedal barriers.
The past cannot hope to have a life sustained by itself, wrenched from the whole.
There remains before us the building of a new land, a home for men who are black, white, brown, from the ruins of the old narrow groups, a synthesis of the rich cultural strains which we have inherited.
There remains to be achieved our integration with the rest of our continent.
Somewhere ahead there beckons a civilisation, a culture, which will take its place in the parade of God's history beside other great human syntheses, Chinese, Egyptian, Jewish, European.
It will not necessarily be all black; but it will be African."
Those are the words of Chief Albert Luthuli.
That's the inspiration that we have taken for the Western Cape.
A province divided, a province not at peace with itself, a province of suspicion and fear.
We've got to get out the message of Chief Luthuli that this province is not yet but can be a home for all its people.
So Chief Luthuli lives with us also, in a very special way because he's the only one who has not spent an extended time to live here amongst us, whether with his will or against his will.
But we thought that his vision for the Western Cape should remain a live vision that successive generations must always continue to strive towards the making of the Western Cape, a home for all.
I want to end up by introducing the person who, when he was Premier, conceived of the idea of the Nobel Square.
I'll be dishonest to say that it was my idea.
It was the idea of Marthinus van Schalkwyk and there's no better way to honour that by inviting him to this podium to speak to you.
Thank you very much.

Pregnancy Education Week : 18 - 26 February 2006
18 February 2006
The aim of Pregnancy Education Week is to provide pregnant women, their partners and the broader community with the knowledge of how to ensure a safe pregnancy outcome for both the mother and her baby.
"We focus on saving mothers and babies through early booking, early recognition of danger signs and early intervention " minister Uys said.
South Africa and the Western Cape have a high infant and maternity mortality rate.
Countrywide it is 12 times higher than the international Western standard.
The estimated maternal mortality rate for South Africa is 175 for every 100 000 births.
In the Western Cape the figure is much lower than half with 77 maternal deaths for every 100 000 births.
" Through awareness weeks such as these we try to lower the mortality rate " says Uys.
Min Uys said women must not only adapt to a healthier lifestyle during pregnancy, but must also be more cautious then usual.
He gave the following advice to pregnant women:
* Visit your nearest clinic or doctor as soon as you suspect that you may be pregnant.
* Book early and attend regularly for check-ups.
* Nurture yourself - your nutrition is important as are exercises during pregnancy.
* Substance abuse eg alcohol and smoking can harm your unborn baby.
Avoid these at all costs during and after the birth of your infant.
* Know you and your partner's HIV status - ask about voluntary HIV counseling and testing at your nearest clinic.
* Discuss with your local clinic the need for a birth companion.
* Discuss and plan feeding options with clinic staff.
* Know the danger signs during pregnancy and seek help immediately at your local clinic or doctor when these signs are noted.
These signs include:
* bleeding from the vagina
* headaches
* blurred vision or seeing stars
* swollen hands, feet and/or face
* fits
* fever
* paleness and /or tiredness
* difficulty in breathing
* lower abdominal pains
* baby not kicking well.
" Partners of pregnant women must also be aware of their responsibilities and not neglect their duties " Minister Uys concluded.

Avian Influenza has Limited Effect on Export of Meat
6 July 2006
SOURCE: Ministry of Agriculture (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
Various measures and actions have been instituted to contain the spread of Avian Influenza that has been detected north of Albertinia, between Mossel Bay and Riversdale.
After further testing to determine the extent of the outbreak actions to eradicate the disease will be taken.
The virus that is responsible for this outbreak has been typed as H5N2 and is not related to the virus that has caused disease in humans in Asia, Europe and North Africa.
As far as is known this virus type poses no threat to humans.
As part of the control measures to prevent the spread of the disease a temporary ban on all movements of ostriches and all types of domesticated poultry in the area between the N2 national road in the south and the Langeberg / Outeniqua mountain ranges in the north and the R323 between the N2 at Riversdale and the Garcia Pass and the R328 between the N2 at Hartenbos and the Robinson Pass in the west and east respectively.
No movements through or originating from this area will be allowed as well as movements between properties in the area.
Although the roads mentioned above forms the boundaries of the area they do not form part of it.
Movement of ostriches and poultry along these roads may take place on condition that the movements do not originate or terminate in the area.
It is envisaged that, with the full cooperation of all role players, the outbreak will remain confined and that the disease will be eliminated from the infected focus.
It must be emphasised that this virus does not affect humans in any way and that all ostrich and poultry products commercially available are therefore safe for human consumption.
Normal slaughter of ostriches from outside this area will take place.
Ostriches originating from the Mossel Bay and Riversdale magisterial districts will not be slaughtered for export purposes.

Worcester/Robertson Cleared of African Horse Sickness
13 July 2006
Early in April 2006 a temporary ban was imposed on the movement of horses, mules, donkeys and zebras in the Worcester and Robertson magisterial districts.
The purpose of this ban was to limit the spread of an outbreak of African Horse Sickness on the border between these districts.
Since the last case of the disease was diagnosed four weeks ago Veterinary Services of the Western Cape Department of Agriculture is now in a position to, with effect on Friday 14 July 2006, lift the ban.
It must be emphasised that all movement of horses within and into the African Horse Sickness control zones in the Western Cape must still adhere to the protocol requirements that have been in place before the ban was instituted.
The details of these requirements can be obtained from the closest State Veterinarian or the State Veterinarian, Boland on telephone 021 808 5026 during office hours.
The protocol aims at preventing the introduction of African Horse Sickness into the Western Cape.
With the cooperation of all role players, and in particular the owners of horses, it was possible to contain the outbreak to a limited area in the Worcester and Robertson districts.
The Department of Agriculture appreciates the cooperation that they received at all times during the period that the ban on the movement of animals was in place.
I want to thank officials of the department for their dedication as well as horse owners for the partnerships that they've formed with us to control and curb the sickness.

Dowry Meets Producers
1 September 2006
In the continuous interaction with producers, Agri Western Cape and other role players it became evident that there is a dire need for further discussion with farmers/producers in the Western Cape to give further input to the Government.
Cobus Dowry, Minister for Agriculture in the Western Cape called a Farmer Indaba for Tuesday 5 September 2006 at Elsenburg, Stellenbosch.
The event will afford between 180 and 200 commercial farmers, industries and agricultural opinion formers the opportunity to table their concerns and to discuss possible solutions for these challenges.
Some of the issues that will be discussed will be Toll Roads, effect of exchange rate, agricultural subsidies, Municipal Levies, All Pay, Housing, Health, Land Reform and the ESTA Act.
Various members of the Western Cape Cabinet, Members of the Standing Committee on Community Development, Heads of Departments and Mayors will attend the event.
A full report of the deliberations will go to the various levels of Government for further action, after the Indaba.

National Polio Immunisation Campaign: 8 to 14 October 2006
6 October 2006
A free polio immunization campaign will sweep across the province from the 8th to 14th October 2006, when all children under five years of age will be immunized.
Minister Uys urge parents, guardians, caregivers and the general public to take all children under five years to their nearest clinic or Community Health Centre for polio immunization, irrespective of their immunization status.
"Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus which affects mainly young children, but any unimmunized person can also get polio," Uys said.
Minister Uys launched the Western Cape Department of Health's campaign in conjunction with the City of Cape Town today at the Tafelsig Community Centre.
Approximately 150 children joined him in symbolically giving polio a "red card" to stop its spread.
"During the immunization campaign special efforts will be made to bring additional immunization posts to all clinics, Community Health Centres and community centres as close to communities as possible," Uys said.
In addition, immunization teams comprised of health care workers will visit day care centers, crèches and pre-schools during the campaign.
"Polio can be prevented by routinely immunizing children against polio at birth, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks and at 18 months free at all public facilities in the province," says Dr. Ivan Toms, Executive Director of City Health.
South Africa has been free of the poliovirus for over 15 years.
Recently Namibia experienced an outbreak of polio earlier this year after being polio free for more than ten years.
The national polio mass immunization campaign is conducted to give extra polio drops to as many children as possible.
This would prevent the poliovirus from circulating among unprotected children.
Children under 5 years of age are most vulnerable therefore they are targeted.

School Governing Bodies (SGBs)
This publications provides parents with information on School Governing Bodies: what they are, what their function is and who participates.
It also outlines parents' roles and responsibilities in the governance of the school.
* What is a School Governing Body?
* Who participates in the SGB?
* What are the functions of the SGB?
* Parental rights and responsibilities
WHAT IS A SCHOOL GOVERNING BODY?
The Schools Act says that all stakeholders in education must accept responsibility for the organisation of schools, and points out that parents and members of local communities are often in the best position to know what a school really needs and what its problems are.
This is why every public school must have a governing body.
Each School Governing Body (SGB) governs the management of its school.
In a school that is registered as a section 21 company, the SGB is also responsible for the school's finances.
WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE SGB?
The SGB consists of:
* the school principal
* elected representatives (parents, educators, other staff members, and learners in grade 8 or above)
* optional co-opted members who do not have the right to vote (for example, members of the community, or the owner of the school property).
You can represent other parents on an SGB if you are nominated and voted for by the parents.
The majority of voting members of the SGB must be parents.
The principal will provide parents with information about SGB elections.
WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SGB?
The governing body must:
* Decide on an admissions policy for the school.
* Decide on the language policy of the school.
* Decide on what religious practices will be followed at the school.
* Adopt a code of conduct for learners which sets out disciplinary procedures.
All these decisions and policies must be in line with national policies.
The SGB must also:
* Adopt a constitution setting out how the SGB will operate.
* Adopt a school mission statement setting out the values and beliefs of the school.
* Decide the times of the school day.
* Administer the school's property, buildings and grounds.
* Make recommendations regarding the appointment of educators at the school.
In addition, a governing body can be given any of these functions:
* maintaining and improving the school's property, buildings and grounds
* deciding on the extramural curriculum and the choice of subject options according to provincial curriculum policy
* buying textbooks, educational material and/or equipment for the school
* paying for services to the school.
The WCED supports SGBs by advising them on their responsibilities and providing training in financial management.
CAN YOU HAVE A SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THE SCHOOL IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE SGB?
All parents whose children are registered at school have rights and responsibilities.
Even if you are not elected onto the school governing body, you still have the right to be involved in the affairs of the school by attending meetings of parents.
You also have the right to be consulted by the educators or the principal about the schooling activities of your child.
The principal and the educators at the school must inform you about the behaviour, attendance and learning progress of you child.

THE MANAGEMENT OF HIV/AIDS IN SCHOOLS
Millions of people are infected with HIV and this number is steadily rising.
As a result, increasing numbers of learners and educators infected with HIV are part of our schools.
People who are infected with HIV face discrimination because of their HIV positive status.
It is therefore important that all schools have an HIV/AIDS policy to ensure that:
* the rights of all learners and educators are respected
* learners and educators with HIV are managed appropriately
* further HIV infection is prevented
* a non-discriminatory and caring learning environment is created.
A national policy on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools has been drafted by the Department of Education for public learning institutions.
Schools and governing bodies should develop and adopt their own policies in keeping with the principles in the national policy.
If a school does not have its own policy this one will automatically apply.
Knowing your rights as parents, educators and learners and understanding the principles of the national policy as well as the Constitution will assist you to effectively manage HIV/AIDS effectively at your school.
CAN HIV POSITIVE LEARNERS BE EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL?
No. The Constitution says that everyone has a right to equality and that children have a right to a basic education.
The national policy also states that no learner may be unfairly discriminated against and denied admission to a school on the basis of his or her HIV status.
MAY LEARNERS WITH HIV BE TREATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO OTHER LEARNERS?
Learners with HIV should not be denied the opportunity to reach their full potential.
Their needs should be accommodated as far as is reasonably possible within the school environment or through home schooling if necessary.
Any special measures taken must be fair, medically justifiable and taken in consultation with the learner and parent.
MAY A SCHOOL DEMAND INFORMATION ABOUT A LEARNER'S HIV STATUS?
No. All medical information is confidential and neither parents nor learners have a legal duty to tell the school authorities of a learner's HIV status.
Should this information be voluntarily disclosed, it must remain confidential.
CAN SCHOOLS ROUTINELY TEST LEARNERS FOR HIV?
There is no medical or scientific justification for routinely testing learners for HIV.
The testing of learners for HIV as a prerequisite for admission or continued attendance is prohibited in the National Policy.
CAN SCHOOLS TEST LEARNERS FOR HIV WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT?
No person may be tested without his or her consent.
HOW SHOULD SCHOOLS PREVENT THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION IN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT?
HIV cannot be transmitted through day-to-day social contact.
Although the risk of HIV transmission in the school is insignificant, all schools should implement universal precautions to prevent the spread of all infections transmitted by blood, including HIV.
These precautions include the following:
* All blood and body fluids should be treated as if they are infected with HIV and handled with extreme caution.
* Latex gloves should be worn by all persons attending to accidents involving blood spills.
* All wounds should be cleaned with water and disinfectant immediately and covered with a waterproof dressing.
* Surfaces contaminated with blood should be cleaned with a bleach solution.
* All schools should have a minimum of two First Aid kits available and accessible.
* Latex gloves should be available in every classroom and at every sporting event.
* All learners and educators should be provided with information on how to handle blood spills.
WHAT ABOUT THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION THROUGH CONTACT SPORT?
The risk of HIV transmission occurring through contact sports is insignificant.
However, should any bleeding occur, the injured player should be taken off the field and treated.
The player may resume play once the wound has been securely covered and soiled clothes changed.
Learners and coaches with HIV should receive medical counselling before participating in contact sport.
DO LEARNERS HAVE A RIGHT TO RECEIVE EDUCATION ABOUT HIV/AIDS?
The National Policy states that a continuing HIV/ AIDS education programme should be implemented in all schools.
This should be integrated into a Life-Skills programme and should be age appropriate and accurate.
Parents should be informed of this programme.
MAY CONDOMS BE ISSUED AT SCHOOLS?
The National Policy acknowledges that this is a complex issue and suggests that issues such as this are resolved taking into account the needs and values of the specific school community.
WHAT ABOUT EDUCATORS AND OTHER STAFF?
The National Policy on HIV/AIDS applies to both learners and educators.
This means that staff in an educational setting may not be:
* tested for HIV without their consent.
* tested for HIV as a prerequisite for appointment or continued service.
* forced to disclose their HIV status.
* dismissed or demoted because of their HIV status.
* discriminated in any way because of their HIV status.
This is in keeping with the fair labour practices as set out in the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Equity Act.
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IF SOMEONE REFUSES TO WORK, TEACH OR STUDY WITH A PERSON WITH HIV?
Accurate information must be provided to learners, educators and parents.
This should be followed up with counselling, if necessary.
The situation should be resolved by the principal with the help of the governing body if necessary.
Your school HIV/AIDS policy should include guidelines on the following:
* Non-discrimination
* Admission Policy
* HIV testing
* Prevention of HIV transmission
* Management of HIV/AIDS
* HIV/AIDS education programmes
* Refusal to study, teach or work with a person with HIV
WHO SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A SCHOOL POLICY?
The governing body of the school should develop and adopt its own policy in consultation with the wider school community.
This could be done through the establishment of a Health Advisory Committee for the school.
The policy may not deviate from the basic principles in the National Policy and should seek to create an environment in which people with HIV will be treated in a just, humane and life-affirming way.

Information on NQF Qualifications and Unit Standards
WHAT IS THE NQF?
The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) is the system that records levels of learning achievement to ensure that the skills and knowledge that have been learned are recognised throughout the country.
There are eight levels on the NQF.
These levels are divided into three bands:
* general education and training
* further education and training
* higher education and training.
QUALIFICATIONS AND UNIT STANDARDS
A qualification is a formal recognition of the learning that has been achieved.
Subject to SAQA approval, a qualification can be registered on the NQF at a specific level.
A certain number of credits are allocated to the successful completion of a registered qualification.
You can search the SAQA qualifications database to find out what qualifications are available for each level, how many credits they are worth, and which service-providers offer this training.
Unit standards are also registered at specific levels of the NQF.
You can accumulate credits for successfully completed unit standards towards a qualification.
You can search the SAQA unit standards database to find out more about unit standards.

The expiry date appears on the card.
Before the card expires you should apply for a new card.
* Applying for a Driving Licence
* Renewing your Driving Licence
APPLYING FOR A DRIVING LICENCE
You are required to have your driving licence on you whenever you are driving a vehicle.
Only people over the age of 18 can apply for a driving licence.
However, you can apply for a licence to drive a motor cycle (up to 125 CC) if you are over the age of 16.
* completed form DL1
* your ID
* four identical black and white photographs of yourself
* the required fee
Your application will specify which type of vehicle you would like to drive (motor cycle, car, minibus etc.).
Once you have applied for the licence and have passed the eye test, a date will be set for your driving test.
The driving test uses the K53 method and the driving examiner will ensure that you:
* have a valid learner's licence
* know and understand the road traffic signs
* have a sound knowledge of the rules of the road and the different signals which a driver of a vehicle is required to give when driving on a public road
* are generally capable of driving the type of vehicle specified on the application
Once you have passed the driveing test, you will be issued with a temporary driving licence while your credit card format driving licence is prepared.
Once the credit card format licence is ready for collection, you will be notified in the post.
When you collect the licence, you need to produce your ID. Licences that are not collected in 120 days are destroyed.
If another person is to collect the driving licence, the person collecting the licence will need to have:
* a certified copy of their identity document
* a certified copy of the driver's identity document
* an affidavit stating why the driver cannot collect the licence themselves which also states the name and ID number of the person collecting the licence.
There is a R120 fee to book a driving test.
RENEWING YOUR DRIVING LICENCE
Your credit card driving licence is only valid for five years and needs to be renewed after this time.
The expiry date appears on your licence.
You will also be sent a renewal notification in the post.
You can renew your licence at any time before your licence expires.
The new licence will be valid for five years from the date of the renewal.
To renew your licence, you need to complete the application form at your nearest Driving Licence Testing Centre.
You will also need:
* your current driving licence
* two black and white ID photographs if you're renewing your licence before the expiry date of your current licence or four photographs if you're renewing your licence after the expiry date
Before your licence can be renewed, you will need to have your fingerprints taken and you will have to undergo an eye test.
If your sight has deteriorated since your licence was issued, new restrictions may be attached to your licence.
For example, you may be required to wear glasses when driving.
Should you fail the eye test completely, your driving licence will not be renewed.
You are not required to undergo the driving examination again.
However, once penalties are introduced, people who have been unable to renew their licences will be able to apply for exemptions from these penalties.
REPLACING YOUR DRIVING LICENCE
If your driving licence is lost, stolen or destroyed, you can apply for a replacement licence.
You will be issued a temporary permit which is valid for six months or until the replacement driving licence is issued, whichever occurs first.
To apply for a replacement licence, you need to complete form TDL at any driving licence testing centre.
You must provide:
* four black and white photographs.
The temporary permit costs R40, while the fee for a replacement licence is R100.

Home > Directories > Services > Educational > Social Issues Affecting Schools > Preventing Discrimination against HIV-positive Learners and Educators
All learners and educators should respect the rights of other learners and educators.
Schools should create an environment which prevents discrimination against HIV-positive learners and staff-members by:
* providing accurate and understandable information on HIV/AIDS to all members of staff, learners and parents.
* implementing an HIV/Aids Policy.
The national Department of Education (DoE) has drafted a national policy on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools.
The national policy applies to both learners and teachers.
School governing bodies should develop and adopt their own policies, which must be in line with the national policy.
They should do this in consultation with the wider school community.
The document Know Your Rights And Responsibilities gives information on the key points of the national policy and how to create a School HIV/Aids policy.

Interventions for Youth at Risk
Youths at risk are learners who have problems such as drug and/or alcohol abuse or are in trouble with the law.
Their emotional and/or behavioural problems are barriers to their learning and development.
In the Western Cape there are five levels of support to prevent or resolve such problems.
The type of support and the restrictions that may be placed on the learner depend on the nature of the problem.
Interventions include educational, therapeutic and/or residential support services.
The five levels of support are:
* Prevention in all schools
* Early intervention in all schools
* School-based support programmes
* Youth care and education centres
* Special youth care and education centres
LEVEL 1: PREVENTION IN ALL SCHOOLS
An early-warning system, aimed at identifying children and families who may be particularly vulnerable, is implemented in all schools.
Every effort is made in the classroom to prevent emotional and/or behavioural difficulties from occurring or worsening.
LEVEL 2: EARLY INTERVENTION IN ALL SCHOOLS
Emotional support and guidance are provided for learners who are struggling with emotional and/or behavioural barriers to learning in the classroom.
LEVEL 3: SCHOOL-BASED SUPPORT PROGRAMMES
School-based support programmes, youth development programmes and deliberate intervention are provided for learners who are identified as being at risk of being expelled from school, being placed away from home, or entering the criminal justice system, and for whom temporary withdrawal from the classroom is necessary.
LEVEL 4: YOUTH CARE AND EDUCATION CENTRES
Where the learner does not benefit adequately from the support programme, referral to a residential or developmental programme at a youth care and education centre may be considered.
The principle of using the least restrictive and most empowering (normative) environment applies throughout the system.
Young people are referred to these centres in accordance with the relevant legislation.
The centres provide accommodation and a structured programme.
The framework for good practice in these institutions is based on the standards laid down by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
These standards aim to:
* Build the capacity of educators and principals to meet the challenges of dealing with learners experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, emotional and/or behavioural barriers to their development.
* Improve services to learners at risk.
* Ensure the safety, education and development of these learners.
There are four Youth Care and Education Centres in the Western Cape:
* Faure Youth Care Centre
* Die Bult Youth Care Centre
* Ottery Youth Care Centre
* Wellington Youth Care Centre.
LEVEL 5: SPECIAL YOUTH CARE AND EDUCATION CENTRES
Special care is provided to young people who are in conflict with the law or in severe emotional turmoil and who may need to be physically, emotionally and/or behaviourally contained.
Young people are referred to these centres by the courts under the relevant legislation for compulsory residence.
Each young person is provided with an individual development plan to help him or her to be rehabilitated.
A psychologist, occupational therapist, professional nurse and social worker are available at the centre for consultation.
The educators are specially trained in child-care theory and practice.
There are two such youth centres in the Western Cape:
* De Novo Special Youth Care Centre
* Eureka Special Youth Care Centre.

28 uDisemba 2006
The Mother City has introduced special measures to ensure that millions of holiday makers - locals and visitors - enjoy a safe and hassle free season in Cape Town.
The Disaster Risk Management Centre is ready for any eventuality.
Metropolitan Police Officers made special provisions and have compiled traffic management plans for popular areas to ensure a smooth flow of holiday traffic.
Fire Services are at a heightened state of readiness during this 'red alert' fire season.
Law enforcement units have strategies to ensure the safety of visitors to beaches and other popular attractions, and Disaster Management Risk Management Centre is ready with contingency plans to co-ordinate large-scale situations should anything go wrong.
"The fact that the City is ready to deal with emergencies does not mean that individuals can ignore common safety rules.
We have compiled a list of simple safety tips which holiday makers can use to ensure a memorable holiday in Cape Town," says Wilfred Solomons, Acting Head: Disaster Risk Management Centre of the City of Cape Town.

Guidelines for Home Education
The WCED checks that learners who are registered for home education are completing work that is consistent with the curriculum and that they are being assessed and are achieving the outcomes required of the particular grade.
To ensure that learners are achieving the required results, the parent needs to:
* Keep certain records
* Appoint an independent assessor
KEEPING RECORDS
After the learner has been registered for home education, the parent must:
* Keep a record of attendance.
* Keep a portfolio of the learner's work.
* Maintain up-to-date records of the learner's progress.
* Keep a portfolio of the educational support given to the learner.
* Keep evidence of the continuous assessment of the learner's work.
* Keep evidence of the assessment and/or examinations at the end of each year.
* Keep evidence at the end of Grades 3, 6 and 9 showing whether or not the outcomes for these grades have been achieved.
These records must be made available for inspection by the WCED.
All relevant assessment results must be kept for three years.
INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
At the end of every phase, the parents must appoint, at their own expense, an independent, suitably qualified person, who is approved by the Head of Education, to assess the learner's progress at the end of that phase.
A parent can approach a public school or a registered independent school for help in finding an appropriate person.
The assessor must submit a statement to the Head of Education confirming that the learner has reached the required level.

Home > Directories > Services > Educational > Preparing for School > Admissions to Schools
Children may enter Grade 1 a year earlier if the WCED's assessment shows them to be ready for school.
Some schools offer Grade R/0 to help children prepare for Grade 1.
Children are usually allowed to start Grade R in the year they turn six.
When you apply at a school to have your child enrolled, you need to have:
* your child's official birth certificate
* proof that your child has been immunised.
Non-South African citizens also need to have:
* a study permit
* a temporary or permanent residence permit or proof that you have applied for permission to stay in South Africa.
No school may unfairly discriminate against a child.
Thus no public school may require children to write an admissions test, or prevent a child from coming to the school because the parents have not paid or cannot pay the school fees.
Submit your application as early as possible the year before your child will be starting at his or her new school.
Submit your application not only to the school of your choice but also to several "second-choice" schools.
You can search for schools in your area using the "Find-a-School" Search Facility.

1 uMatshi 2007
'The secret weapon against diarrhea is plenty of water', said Minister Uys during a visit to the Delft Community Health Center.
'Parents of young children must wash their hands with soap and water a few times per day and if their children have diarrhea then lots of water would be just the right medicine, said Uys.
Symptoms of diarrhea include:
* Passing of a little urine
* High body temperature
* Children who refuse the breast or take the bottle poorly
Uys said that during the warm summer months and especially during February and March, the prevalence of diarrhea is much higher than other times and parents must be vigilant about their children's condition.
Minister Pierre Uys said that apart from the medical readiness of his staff, they are also conducting an awareness campaign with increased focus on places such as Delft, Bloekombos, Wallacedene and Khayelitsha.
The awareness campaign includes the distribution of pamphlets, information sessions to mothers at clinics and radio adverts.
In addition, hospitals during this time of the year make available more beds for diarrhea patients and our Red Cross Children's Hospital is ready to handle the more acute cases.
A simple, yet effective recipe for diarrhea is an easy sugar-salt solution:
* Wash your hands and holder with soap and water
* 1 Liter clean water
* Mix until the sugar and salt has dissolved
* Give the sick child the solution as often as possible
* Give the solution as soon as the child shows any symptoms
Minister Uys said that parents do not have to give medicines to stop diarrhea but can keep their children out of the health facilities if they applied these very simple prescriptions.

Mass Consumer Awareness Campaign
INJONGO:
To raise consumers' awareness of their rights.
UMGANGATHO:
Liyaqhubekeka
INKCAZELO:
This is a six-month mass media campaign to make members of the public aware of their rights as consumers, as well as the existence of the Office of the Consumer Protector (OCP) and the services available there.
The campaign has been developed and implemented by Comutanet.
The campaign has directed its message at commuters who are a captive audience for the duration of the journey (by bus, train or taxi).
The campaign consists of five components:
1. Posters
A set of four posters, titled "Know Your Rights", "Avoid Being Black-listed", "Hire Purchase" and "Cash Loans" were created and placed on Metro train carriages for a period of six months.
2. Decals
Smaller versions of the posters are being placed in 100 taxis, over a period of ten months.
3. Commuter FM radio message
A message is being played over Commuter FM over 2 months, which will reach an estimated 239 000 listeners per day.
4. Star Taxi Music
Contemporary music is supplied free of charge to taxi drivers on cassettes.
The cassette also contains a 60-second jingle/message from the Office of the Consumer Protector.
5. Trailer advertising
A-frame trailers have been parked at strategic intersections for a total of 72 days over six months, including a few rural areas.
Leaflets are distributed at the intersections at the same time.
The campaign started in late May 2003 when the first posters were placed in trains.
Since then the Office of the Consumer Protector has seen a substantial increase in phone calls.
The Star Taxi Music cassettes have also been distributed.
The decals were placed in taxis from the end of July 2003.
The trailer advertising was delayed.

21 August 2007
Media Statement by Western Cape Minister of Health, Pierre Uys
The names of two hospitals in the Western Cape will change.
The current Hottentots Hospital in the Helderberg region will become the Helderberg Hospital, while Eben Donges Hospital in Worcester will be renamed the Worcester Hospital.
The process to change the names was initiated after a round of community Imbizo's last year during which a number of objections about the names of these hospitals were raised by local communities.
Following the Imbizo's, Uys invited comment on the current names from interested parties through newspaper advertisements.
A number of suggestions were received and after further consultation the Minister decided to rename the hospitals to the region/town in which they functioned.
"I believe the majority of the people in the Western Cape would support the name changes as it allows people to take pride in their local hospital " says Uys.

Vehicle Clearance Certificates
If your car's engine number or chassis number has changed, you are required to get a clearance certificate before you can reregister the vehicle.
You first need to apply at a motor vehicle registering office for a Request for Police Clearance.
Then you need to take your vehicle to a vehicle clearance unit of the South African Police Service where the clearance certificate will be issued.
There is no fee unless a new chassis or engine number needs to be embossed.

The goal of Khanya is to promote learning and to maximise educator capacity by integrating the use of appropriate, available and affordable technology into the curriculum delivery process.
"By the start of the 2012 academic year, every educator in every school of the Western Cape will be empowered to use appropriate and available technology to deliver curriculum to each and every learner in the province."
Starting with the most disadvantaged schools, Khanya works towards eradicating the digital divide and achieving racial and gender equity.
Some of the specific objectives of the project include:
* using technology to help educators
* providing an opportunity for learners to benefit from a variety of learning styles, using technology
* using technology to help disabled learners
* increasing the number of learners taking Mathematics and Science on the higher grade and coping successfully
* preparing all learners for the Information Age
* narrowing the digital divide
* providing all educators and learners in the province with an email address.

WHAT IS THE KHANYA PROJECT?
The Khanya Project is an initiative of the Western Cape Education Department, which started in April 2001.
The project looks at ways to use information, communication and audiovisual technology to improve teaching and learning, or curriculum delivery in schools.
The aim is that every teacher in the Western Cape will eventually use technology, such as computers or televisions, to teach.
This can help alleviate the shortage of qualified teaching staff at many schools.
The project also expects that learners will be able to use computers to learn.
Hardware in the form of computers and software such as computer programmes are supplied to schools.
The implementation depends on the specific needs of the school.
Although all schools will eventually be targeted, the project has initially been implemented where the need is greatest and where results are most likely to be achieved.
The project is therefore focusing on well-managed schools in poor areas with sound academic results, where new technology will make the most difference to the lives of teachers and learners.
The schools are invited to join the project when their staff is ready to adopt the technologies and integrate them into their teaching practices.
The project has done a survey to find out what the technology needs of each school are.
Computer networks are established with Internet connectivity and audiovisual facilities in individual schools answering to their specific educational needs.
KHANYA PARTNERS
Khanya's immense success is due in part to the amazing partnerships between the project, private businesses, non-profit organisations and other government departments and projects.
If you would like to find out how you can support the project, contact Ingrid Graham at 021 467 2228, fax her at 021 425 7458 or email her at ingridg@xsinet.co.za.
The Computer Society of South Africa is assisting Khanya through facilitating learnships into the Khanya Learnership Kickstart Programme.
If you are interested in participating in this programme complete the expression of interest form.
ACHIEVEMENTS
The Khanya Project has been highly acclaimed locally and internationally.
Its latest accolade came in September 2004, when it won the Standard Bank Centre for Public Sector Innovation Award in the category Innovative Service Delivery Institutions.
Khanya Achievements as at March 2006:
* 490 schools have been helped to use technology effectively.
* Another 134 schools are in various stages of preparation for the next wave of implementation.
* A total of 18,306 computers are used in Khanya schools (of these 10,561 have been funded by Khanya or its donor partners, and the balance of 7,745 have been procured by the schools themselves).
* 13,034 Educators are being empowered to use technology optimally for curriculum delivery .
* 432,460 learners are already reaping the benefits of the project.

Statistics South Africa did a National Travel Survey on behalf of the National Department of Transport from 25 May to 20 June 2003.
The survey provided an accurate analysis of the population's transport habits broken down by gender, modes of transport, rural and urban areas, and local authority planning zones (e.g. townships and suburbs within Johannesburg).
The Survey interviewed around 50 000 households nationwide to determine their travel patterns and which modes of transport they use to get to work, hospitals and schools.
The National Department of Transport saw a need for the survey because there is currently no reliable and detailed instrument that can measure key White Paper and National Land Transport Transition Act performance indicators for public transport users.
The results of the survey will provide the National Department of Transport with information that will assist in planning and assisting with the targeting of transportation investments and subsidies.

Home > Directories > Projects > Transport > Public Transport > Rapid Bus Transport System
Apartheid urban design ensured that Cape Town's poor and working class live furthest from their places of work.
Many people thus rely on public transport.
The Provincial Government has developed a mobility strategy to revitalise the public transport system and address some of the problems created by the existing infrastructure.
The first phase of this extensive project will be the introduction of a rapid bus transit (RBT) system along the Klipfontein corridor.
This will entail a dedicated bus route from Khayalitsha to Mowbray, along with improved cycling and pedestrian paths.
It is expected that the development of Klipfontein Road into a transport corridor will result in many advantages for businesses, communities and public transport operators.
The project is a joint initiative between the Department of Transport and Public Works and the City of Cape Town.

What to Do at an Accident Scene
This document contains step-by-step information on what to do if you are in a vehicle accident.
WHAT TO DO AT AN ACCIDENT SCENE
If you are involved in an accident, you need to:
* Stop.
* Help anyone who is hurt.
* Find out what the extent of the damage is.
* Get all relevant information.
* Report the accident to the police.
* Do not interfere with the evidence.
* Be aware of the legal consequences.
The police will complete an accident report, which is filed either with the SAPS, the local municipality or the provincial Department of Transport and Public Works, depending on whether a criminal case has been opened and whether the accident occurred inside the area of the local authority.
All accident reports for accidents outside municipal areas, where there is no criminal case being investigated, are kept with the Department.
STOP!
If you are involved in an accident that causes injury to or the death of anyone, or which causes damage to property or any animal, you are required by law to stop your vehicle.
It is a crime not to stop after an accident, and you could be fined up to R36,000, or sent to prison for up to nine years, or both.
You don't have to stop or report an accident if you crash into a tree and only damage your own car and you yourself are the only one that gets hurt.
But, if you damage someone else's property you must stop and then report the incident at the nearest police station.
When you stop, you should switch on your hazard lights to warn other traffic of the accident.
HELP ANYONE WHO IS HURT
The national 24-hour emergency number is 084124 or you can phone the SAPS on 10111.
If you don't know anything about first aid, be careful not to do anything that might make the injury worse.
Unless you yourself need to go for help, you must stay at the scene until a police officer says you can leave.
You can be criminally charged for failing to help anyone who is hurt in the accident.
FIND OUT WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE IS
You will need to find out how much damage has been caused to property.
You need to give your name and address and vehicle registration number to anyone who might need them.
GET ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION
If you are involved in the accident, you should try to get the following information from all parties involved and witnesses:
* full names
* ID numbers
* addresses
* telephone details
* vehicle registration numbers.
You should also get:
* descriptions of the vehicles
* details of police and traffic officers and ambulance personnel
* details of tow truck personnel.
This information will help you if you want to make a claim against your insurance or against the Road Accident Fund, or if you want to claim the costs of repairs from the other party.
At a later stage, you or your lawyers may need a copy of the accident report that is filled out by the police.
REPORT THE ACCIDENT TO THE POLICE
The police don't have to be called to the scene if no one has been hurt, but the accident must be reported - by both drivers - at a police station or traffic office within 24 hours.
You must also show your driver's licence.
If you are hurt and can't report the accident immediately, you must do it as soon as possible and explain why there has been a delay in reporting the accident.
It is an offence not to report an accident in which another person's property has been damaged, or in which another person is injured, even if neither of the drivers intends taking legal action.
DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE EVIDENCE
You must NOT drink any alcohol or take any drugs that have a narcotic effect unless it is on doctor's orders.
If the police ask you to go for a medication examination, you must not drink any alcohol or take any drugs that have a narcotic effect before the examination and before you have reported the accident.
If anyone is injured in the accident, the vehicles may not be moved before the police or traffic officer have arrived and said that the vehicles can be moved.
If the accident totally block the passage of other vehicles, the vehicle may be moved sufficiently to allow vehicles to pass, but only after you have clearly marked the vehicle positions (for example with chalk or spray paint).
BE AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
Some of the possible legal consequences following an accident are:
* a criminal charge of driving without a license
* a criminal charge of drunken driving
* a criminal charge of culpable homicide
* a civil claim for damage to property
* a civil claim for personal injury.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Life & Family > Death > Making a Will
When you die, your estate is divided out between your family or the people that you want to have inherit from you.
The estate consists of your personal property and possessions, as well as any money or other assets owed by you.
Who your property is passed on to depends on whether you have a valid will or not.
If you have a valid will then the property is divided according to your wishes.
If you die without a will (called intestate) then your property will be divided up amongst your immediate family according to the laws of intestate succession.
CREATING A VALID WILL
If you are older than 16, you can make a will stating who you want your property to go to when you die.
For your will to be valid it needs to be made in the proper way and you need to be mentally competent when you create the will.
This means that you must be able to understand the consequences of creating a will, must be in a reasonable state of mind and remember what you own.
For a will to be valid you must make sure that:
* The will is in writing.
* Two people older than 14 witness the making of the will (these witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will).
* You have initialled every page of the will and signed the last page, in the presence of the witnesses.
* The witnesses have initialled and signed the will.
In your will you can:
* appoint an executor
* divide up your property.
An executor is the person that will make sure that your property is divided up according to your wishes, as set out in your will.
The executor also settles your outstanding debts.
If you don't choose an executor, the court will appoint someone, usually a family member to be your executor.
You can get a lawyer to help you to draw up a will or you can get an easy-to-complete will form from a stationary shop.
DYING WITHOUT A WILL
If you don't have a valid will when you die, your property is divided up according to the rules set out in the law.
These rules state that:
* A married person's property is shared equally by their spouse and their children.
* The property is divided between other family members if there is no spouse or children
* If there are no blood relatives then the property is given to the government.
Different rules apply under customary law but this results in a situation that is totally unfair to the wife.

* Deceased Estates: Wills (Public Information)
Home > Publications > Public Information > I &gt Deceased Estates: Wills
Deceased Estates: Wills
Please note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive guide on wills.
A will is a specialized document, which should preferably be drawn up by an expert like an attorney or trust company.
The information merely aims to inform people about some basic aspects of wills.
* Who is competent to make a will?
* Who is competent to act as a witness to a will?
* What are the requirements for a valid will?
* What are the requirements for a valid will if I cannot sign my name?
* What is a codicil?
* What if I want to amend my will?
* Must I amend my will after divorce?
* What will happen if I do not leave a will?
WHO IS COMPETENT TO MAKE A WILL?
Everyone 16 years old and over, unless at the time of making the will they are mentally incapable of appreciating the consequence of their actions.
WHO IS COMPETENT TO ACT AS A WITNESS TO A WILL?
Anyone who is 14 years old and over and who at the time that they witness the will is competent to give evidence in court.
A beneficiary to a will should not sign as a witness, because they will then be disqualified from receiving any benefit from that will.
There are some exceptions to this rule.
Consult your legal representative for more information in this regard.
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID WILL?
* Since 1 January 1954 all wills must be in writing.
They can be written by hand, typed or printed.
* The testator (person making the will) must sign at the end of the last page of the will.
* The testator must sign all other pages of the will anywhere on the page.
* The testator must sign the will in the presence of two or more competent witnesses.
* The witnesses must attest and sign the will in the presence of the testator and of each other.
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID WILL IF I CANNOT SIGN MY NAME?
You may ask someone to sign the will on your behalf or you can sign the will by the making of a mark (for example a thumbprint or a cross).
If you make a mark, or get someone to sign on your behalf, you must follow these requirements:
* If it was made after 1 January 1954, the will must be in writing.
It can be written by hand, typed or printed.
* The testator must sign the will at the end of the last page by making a mark, or if someone signs on their behalf, this other person must sign at the end of the last page in the presence and by the direction of the testator.
* The mark or the signature of the other person signing on behalf of the testator must be made in the presence of two or more competent witnesses and a commissioner of oaths.
* If the will consists of more than one page, every page except the last one must be signed by the testator or by the person signing on their behalf anywhere on the page.
* A commissioner of oaths must certify that they are satisfied as to the identity of the testator and that the will is the will of the testator.
* The commissioner of oaths must sign a certificate and each page of the will, anywhere on the page.
WHAT IS A CODICIL?
A codicil is a schedule or annexure to an existing will, which is made to add to or to change an existing will.
A codicil must comply with the same requirements as a valid will (listed above).
A codicil does not need to be signed by the same witnesses who signed the original will.
WHAT IF I WANT TO AMEND MY WILL?
Amendments to a will can only be made while executing a will or after the date of execution of the will.
Amendments to a will must comply with the same requirements for a valid will (listed above).
When amending a will, it is not necessary for the same witnesses who signed the original to sign the updated will.
MUST I AMEND MY WILL AFTER DIVORCE?
A bequest to your ex in your will, which was made before your divorce, will not necessarily fall away after the divorce.
The Wills Act says that, unless you specifically provide otherwise, a bequest to your divorced spouse will be cancelled if you die within three months of the divorce.
This gives a divorced person three months after the divorce in which to amend their will.
Should you not change your will within three months after your divorce, your divorced spouse will benefit as indicated in the will.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DO NOT LEAVE A WILL?
If you die without leaving a will or a valid will, your estate will be split up according to the Intestate Succession Act, no. 81 of 1987.
The estates of people who die intestate and whose estates are governed by the principles of customary law, must be reported to the Magistrate for the area in which the person was resident at the time of their death.
The local magistrate should be consulted on how an estate that is subject to customary law will be dealt with.

Giving up a Child for Adoption
Both the mother and the father must sign the consent form to allow the adoption by a specific person or couple.
If the biological parents are not married, the mother must first get the consent of the biological father.
However she only needs to do this if the pregnancy was not the result of violence, and if the father acknowledges in writing that he is the father and has made his identity and address available.
Putting a child up for adoption is a difficult thing to do and adoption agencies will provide support services to assist you.
These can include counselling and even accommodation.
For more information contact your District Office of the Department of Social Development or an adoption agency in your area.

Finding Information about Biological Parents
As an adopted child, you can start a search for your biological parents if you are over 18 years old.
If you are between 18 and 21, you will need to have your adoptive parents' written permission.
If you are over 21 you can search without your adoptive parents' permission.
Before you can start the search, you will receive counselling by a social worker.
Adoption records are kept for 70 years and are the initial source of information.
The records are kept with the Registrar of Adoptions in Pretoria.
The following records are kept:
* The consent form
* The adoptive parents' applicationThe
* social worker's report on the adoptive parents
* The social worker's report on the birth parents (if it exists).
Specific information regarding an adoption may be given to any person at the discretion of the Registrar.
But the identity of the parties cannot be made known.
For example, medical information can be made available to a doctor.
Biological parents can only have access to the adoption records if the adoptive parents and the child give their written consent.
If they refuse, the biological parents can leave their details in the file so that they can be contacted if the adoptive parents or child change their minds.
For more information contact the Registrar of Adoptions at the National Department of Social Development in Pretoria.Ms.

Home > Directories > Services > Social Services > Children & Families > Getting a Maintenance Order
Getting a Maintenance Order
Both parents have a legal duty to support their children.
One parent can apply to the Maintenance Court for the other parent to pay support for their children.
Usually a mother will apply for an order against a father.
If the children are not living with the mother or the father, the person who is looking after them can apply for maintenance from the parents.
For example, if a child is living with the grandparents, the grandparents can apply to get maintenance from the father and the mother of the child.
Once there is a court order instructing a parent to pay child support, it is a criminal offence not to pay.
They also deal with applications to get more or to pay less maintenance.
This is a long and complicated process and may take some time.
To apply for a maintenance order against the parent of your child, you need to:
1. Go to the Maintenance Office at the Maintenance Court in your area to apply for the court order.
* The name and address of the person against whom the order is being made, and the details of where they work
* A photograph of the other person (if available)
* Your identity document
* The children's birth certificates
* A letter of attendance from the school principal for any school-going child
* A copy of the divorce order (if applicable)
* Proof of your income (like a salary or slip)
* Your papers, receipts and accounts, showing all the things you must pay every month
2. The maintenance officer will send a summons to the person against whom the order is being made asking them to come to the maintenance office on a certain date.
3. On the date, you and the other party must go to the office to determine how much that person must pay for the children.
4. The maintenance officer will help you work out all the things you must pay for every month, how much money you earn and how much money the other parent earns.
5. If the person against whom the order is being made says that they are not the parent of the child, you need to ask the court to order a paternity test.
6. If you agree how much the person must pay for the children, the maintenance officer will get both of you to sign a paper called an order of court.
This says that the other party must pay the agreed amount of money every week or every month.
7. If you do not agree, or if the other person does not come to the office on that date, then the officer will say your case must go to the Maintenance Court.
The court sends notices to both parties telling you both to come to the Maintenance Court on a certain date.
8. The magistrate will listen to both the parents' stories.
They will ask both parties to show how much they earn and how much they pay every month for things like rent, electricity and food.
9. The magistrate then decides how much the other person must pay for the children.
The magistrate will make this amount an order of court, in writing.
10. The person against whom the order is being made must pay the maintenance amount every week or month to the maintenance office.
You must then collect the money from the maintenance office.
For more information contact the maintenance officer at your local Magistrates' Court.

* Enforcing a Maintenance Order (Service)
* Maintenance Act, 99 of 1998 (Act)
Enforcing a Maintenance Order
If the court has ordered that a parent must pay child support, it is a criminal offence not to pay.
If the person who has been ordered to pay maintenance does not pay, even though the court has ordered them to do so, you need to:
1. Go to the maintenance office and complain.
It is important to make a formal complaint every time when the other parent doesn't pay.
2. The maintenance office records each time the other parent pays.
This record will show when they do not pay and how much they owe.
3. If the other parent is employed and failed to pay maintenance, you must ask the court to make an order to get the maintenance directly from their employer.
4. If the other party does not pay, they are not obeying the order of court.
This is a crime.
The court will send them a notice telling them to come to court on a certain date.
They must then explain why they did not pay the money.
5. For more information contact the maintenance officer at your local Magistrates' Court.

They exist to make the court process quicker and cheaper.
There is a fee of approximately R15 to use the Court and there are no lawyers involved, so there are no lawyer's fees.
If you want to, you can get legal advice before going to court.
Legal assistants and clerks of the Small Claims Courts will assist you free of charge.
Individuals can institute claims in the court, but companies can't.
Any of the official languages can be used in the court.
The case is not heard by a Judge or Magistrate, but rather by a Commissioner, who hears each side of the story and asks questions.
The Small Claims Court does not hear divorce cases.
To institute a claim in the Small Claims Court, you need to:
* Give the other person a written demand giving them 14 days to comply.
* After 14 days, institute a claim with the clerk of the Court.
* Serve a summons on the other person.
* Go to court on the set date with all relevant documents and any witnesses you have.
The hearing is an informal and simple one, and there is no cross examination.
The Commissioner will ask all the questions and when they have heard from all parties, will make a decision.
If you need more details, the Department of Justice has a brochure on instituting proceedings in the Small Claims Court.

WORK PERMITS
There are different types of work permits:
* quota work permit
* general work permit
* exceptional skills work permit
* intra-company transfer work permit
* corporate work permit
The Department approves applications for work permits based on whether or not a South African is available to fill the position applied for.
If there is, it's unlikely that the work permit application will be successful.
The Department readily approves work permit applications for key personnel (for e.g. a CEO) of foreign companies investing in South Africa.
The Immigration Act introduced a quota system for work permits.
HOW TO APPLY FOR A WORK PERMIT
You need to submit an application on form BI-159 via the South African diplomatic representative in the country where you normally live or the country of which you have a passport.
You can also apply through a South African attorney or agent who has power of attorney for you.
Your application needs to be accompanied by:
* a firm offer of employment
* a letter from the prospective employer stating the date that the position became available, how it was advertised and why it's necessary to employ a non-South African.
The fee for each work permit application is about US$186 and generally takes eight to twelve weeks.
Applications for key personnel however generally take about two weeks.
Once your application has been processed, the outcome is faxed to the SA representatives at the country where you applied.
HOW TO APPLY FOR A STUDY PERMIT
You first need to apply for admission to the higher education institution you want to attend.
When you receive a letter of provisional acceptance you can apply for a study permit.

Registration of Private Collections of Fossils, Archaeological Artefacts and Meteorites
Legally, owners of privately held collections of fossils, artefacts and meteorites that were collected under previous legislation had until 1 April 2002 to register their collections with the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA).
There are a number of advantages to creating a register of these items:
* Each collection has a catalogue, ensuring that the information is not lost.
* Provision is made for bequeathing the collection to family, friends or to an institution.
* Professionals who ratify these collections can advise and aid the owner.
* The collections become legal.
* Important information held in these collections becomes part of the shared national estate.
The registration process does not affect the ownership of the registered collections, which remain the property of the owner.
* all collections of archaeological artefacts, including artefacts older than 100 years, rock paintings or rock engravings, artefacts that have been excavated or collected from sites associated military history older than 75 years, and artefacts associated with ships and other wrecks older than 60 years.
* all collections of fossils and other palaeontological material (including trace fossils such as ancient footprints).
* all collections of meteorites.

Home > Directories > Services > Life & Family > Marriage/Divorce > Getting Permission to Marry if you are Underage
Boys under 18 and girls under 15 cannot get married without special permission and anyone under the age of 21 has to get their parents' permission before they can get married.
A marriage contracted without the required consent is voidable.
This means that it can be declared null and void by the High Court.
The parents or guardian can apply to the High Court for a declaration voiding the marriage.
This application needs to be made:
* before the minor turns 21
* within six weeks of finding out about the marriage.
The minor may apply to the court to void the marriage at any time before they turn 21, or within three months after turning 21.
PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR MINORS (ANYONE UNDER 21)
Where both parents are alive and neither of the parents has sole guardianship of the minor, both parents must consent to the marriage, in writing, on form BI-32.
If the minor is a child born out of wedlock, only the mother's written consent on form BI-32 is required.
If one parent has been granted sole guardianship of the minor, only that parent's written consent is required on form BI-32.
If the minor is in the care of a legal guardian, only the guardian's written consent (BI-32) is necessary.
If a parent whose consent is legally required cannot be found to grant consent, or is legally incompetent to do so, you can apply to a commissioner of child welfare for consent to the marriage.
Should the minor's parents, and/or a commissioner of child welfare refuse to grant consent, the minor may apply to a Judge of the High Court for consent.
The Judge will not grant consent unless there is sufficient evidence that the marriage is in the interest of the child and that consent has been unreasonably refused.
SPECIAL PERMISSION FOR BOYS UNDER 18 AND GIRLS UNDER 15
Boys under 18 and girls under 15 must get the written consent of their parents to marry, in the same way as other minors.
They also have to get the consent of the Minister of Home Affairs.
You can also apply to the Minister to condone a marriage that has already taken place without the required consent.

Home > Directories > Services > Life & Family > Marriage/Divorce > Getting Divorced
This ends the marriage and the divorced parties can legally marry again.
The divorce process will depend on whether the marriage is a civil marriage or a customary marriage.
Civil marriages are dissolved according to the rules and procedures set out in the Divorce Act.
Marriages in terms of African Customary Law are dissolved according to the civil law but some of the consequences are determined by custom and tradition.
Muslim and Hindi marriages are dissolved in terms of the rites and rituals of the religion.
There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in a divorce, including
CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN
Before the court will issue a divorce, it has to be decided who will look after the children.
The parents can make an agreement or the court can decide.
The most important consideration in deciding which parent should have custody is the best interests of the children.
The Family Advocate at the court can help investigate which parent is in the best position to look after the children and will represent the children in the court if necessary.
If the divorce is taking a long time, for example if the parties don't agree, then an interim custody order can be issued setting out who will look after the children while the divorce is being finalised.
In African, Hindu and Muslim customary marriages, the wife usually takes custody of the children.
According to African customary law, the father usually remains the children's natural guardian.
The children of Hindu and Muslim marriages are regarded as illegitimate, so the mother is also the natural guardian.
In all cases, the father still has a duty to support the children.
ACCESS TO THE CHILDREN
The parent who does not get custody will usually still want to see their children.
There therefore needs to be an agreement about when, where and how this parent will have access to the children.
If it is not in the best interests of the children for the other parent to have access rights, then the court can restrict access.
MAINTENANCE
When a couple gets divorced, one party is often in a better financial position than the other.
The person who has custody of the children will also have expenses that the other parent does not have.
The court will issue a maintenance order requiring maintenance to be paid for the children and, depending on the circumstances, to the other party.
Maintenance for the children is paid to the parent who has custody (but it is important to remember that this is the child's right and not the parent's).
All parents have a duty to support their children, including children who are illegitimate.
If there are problems with maintenance after the divorce has gone through, these can be taken to the Maintenance officer at the Magistrates Court.
Whether one party will have to pay maintenance or support to the other party depends on the circumstances.
If the parties cannot agree on how much should be paid then the court will decide.
Because Hindu or Muslim marriages are not fully recognised as legal marriages, the wife has no legal status to claim support after divorce.
DIVIDING UP PROPERTY
How the family property will be divided up depends on what property regime the couple adopted when they got married.
This will usually be covered in the ante-nuptial agreement if there is one or, if there is no pre-marital contract, then it is determined by law.
The default legal position is that civil marriages are in community of property with accrual.
This means that everything that you own is shared, including property and debts.
Accrual means that everything that you earn or buy after you have married also becomes part of the joint estate.
If you get divorced, the shared property is divided equally between you.
Any debts are also shared.
If you sign an ante-nuptial agreement, you can choose to get married:
* in community of property
* out of community of property without accrual
* out of community of property with accrual.
If the marriage is out of community of property without accrual, then each person keeps their own property from before the marriage and keeps whatever they earn or acquire during the marriage.
If the marriage is out of community of property with accrual then each person keeps their own property from before the marriage but anything that is accumulated during the marriage is shared.
Some things, like inheritances or gifts remain separate.
The default property regime has changed for different people at different times.
The laws that were in place when you got married will determine what property regime applies to your marriage.
DISSOLVING A CIVIL MARRIAGE
A civil marriage needs to be dissolved by a court.
Grounds for divorce
You can only get a divorce if you show the court that there has been an "irretrievable breakdown" of the marriage or that one of the spouses is mentally ill or continuously unconscious.
Irretrievable breakdown means that the couple can no longer live together and there is no reasonable chance of them resolving their differences.
Proof of this can include evidence showing that:
* The couple have not lived together for a while.
* One partner cheated on the other.
* One partner left the other.
* One partner abused the other.
* The couple no longer love each other.
You can get a divorce if your partner has been institutionalised for mental illness for at least two years and doctors don't think that they will ever recover.
You can get divorced if your partner has been unconscious for at least six months and doctors don't believe that they will ever recover.
The divorce process
If you want to ask the court to issue a divorce you need to prepare a summons dealing with:
* Who will have custody of the children.
* How the parent who does not have custody will access the children.
* Who will receive maintenance, how much it will be and how and when it will be paid.
* How your property will be divided up.
If you and your partner can reach a settlement agreement before the summons is issued, this will make the process much quicker and easier.
If you reach an agreement, you should write it down and sign it.
This consent paper should then be attached to the divorce summons.
A hearing date will be set.
At this hearing, the judge will ask questions to confirm the information in the summons.
Once everything is settled, a divorce order will be granted.
If you use the Family Court instead of a High Court your divorce may go through more quickly and more cheaply.
DISSOLVING A MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF AFRICAN CUSTOMARY LAW
Customary marriages are similar to civil marriages in that the court must issue the divorce order and the divorce will only be granted if there are grounds for divorce (that is irretrievable breakdown, mental illness or continuous unconsciousness).
The parties can decide the terms of the divorce and then the judge will issue the relevant orders regarding custody and maintenance.
If the court has to decide on these matters it will take into account any arrangements that may have been made in terms of customary law.
The wife's family may have to return all or part of the lobola to the husband's family, unless the husband publicly rejected his wife for no reason at all.
DISSOLVING A MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF THE MUSLIM AND HINDU RELIGIONS
If a man and woman were married by an imam in the Muslim religion or a priest in the Hindu religion, they are not married in terms of the civil law.
They can then divorce without going to court but they must follow the rules of their religion.

* The Bill of Rights
WHAT IS THE SAHRC?
The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is made up of a Commission and a Secretariat.
The Commission
The chairperson is the Reverend Dr Barney Pityana and the deputy chairperson is Ms Shirley Mabusela.
The Commission has up to eleven commissioners, including the chairperson and the deputy chairperson.
The Secretariat
The chief executive officer heads the Secretariat.
It has 4 departments:
* Education, Training and Information
* Legal Services
* Research and Documentation
* Finance and Administration
The SAHRC has committees made up of commissioners, staff and outside members.
They work in the following areas:
* Policy and Planning;
* Government and Parliamentary Liaison;
* Legal and Constitutional Affairs;
* NGO and Statutory Body Liaison;
* International Liaison;
* Disability; and
* Children.
In addition, each commissioner has special responsibility for one or more provinces.
They visit the provinces to build relationships with structures there, analyse trends and respond to complaints.
WHAT DOES THE SAHRC DO?
The SAHRC was set up by the Constitution to:
* develop a culture of human rights in South Africa;
* educate South Africans about human rights; investigate human rights violations and find ways of correcting them
* (including taking cases to court, if necessary); undertake research on human rights in South Africa and internationally; advise government on human rights and check how government promotes and protects human rights;
* monitor laws written at all levels of government (local, provincial and national) to make sure they observe human rights; and monitor what government does to make sure people have access to socio-economic rights (environment, housing, health care, food, water, social security and education).
REPORTING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
A human rights violation is when any of the rights in the Bill of Rights are abused or violated.
However, the SAHRC does not handle all violations.
Some cases are referred to other organisations and structures set up to deal with specific kinds of violations.
These include:
The Commission for Gender Equality
(discrimination cases on the grounds of sex or gender)
Tel: 011 403 7182
The Public Protector
(complaints against government officials)
Tel: 012 322 2915/6
The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration
(cases of unfair labour practice)
Tel: 011 377 6894
The Independent Complaints Directorate
(complaints against the police)
Tel: 012 428 5700
Advice and assistance with your case may also be obtained from Legal Aid Boards (situated at Magistrates’ Courts), or from Legal Aid Clinics (at most universities).
Also, there are many NGOs (such as Lawyers for Human Rights, Legal Resources Centre and Black Sash), which might also be able to help you.
HOW TO REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS TO THE SAHRC
If your case is a violation of one of the rights in the Bill of Rights, and it is not the type of case dealt with by another organisation, you can report it to the SAHRC by:
Phoning an SAHRC office.
A member of staff will either take a statement, send you a complaints form or make an appointment for you to come to the office in person.
or
Sending a fax or letter to the Legal Services Department of the SAHRC in the language of your choice.
Getting a complaints form from the SAHRC, completing it and returning it to the SAHRC.

First Bursary to foster skills in Local Government
21 April 2004
SOURCE: Department of Local Government (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
The Department of Local Government in the Western Cape as part of our mandate to strengthen, monitor and capacitate local government with a focus on developmental local government, has invited district municipalities to nominate candidates for the first ever bursary awarded by this department.
The aim of the bursaries is to make it possible for previously disadvantaged municipal officials to undertake tertiary studies in the field of Development Management.
It is with pride that I can announce that the first ever recipient of the bursary for part-time study for a MPHIL in Sustainable Development has been awarded to Mr Ralph Links from the Central Karoo District Municipality.
Mr Links already took up his bursary and commenced his studies during February 2004.
This initiative is part of a departmental programme to foster skills in developmental studies in the local government sphere.
It is in our common interest that formerly disadvantaged municipal officials receive the necessary training and to equip them with the necessary skills to benefit local government in the Western Cape.
With interventions, such as bursaries for further tertiary studies and extensive training certificate courses aimed at management of municipalities with specific focus on female middle/senior level municipal officials, municipal management trainees and potential municipal management trainees to achieve demographic representativity the Department of Local Government has taken the responsibility to ensure that this goal is achieved.
This is part of our common efforts and is reflected in my Ministry and Department's Vision, which is "Developmental Local Government through Partnerships and Co-responsibility".

Statement by Minister of Agriculture on Suspected Avian Influenza
5 August 2004
Suspected Avian Influenza - Western Cape Alert
The National Department of Agriculture informed us that three ostrich farms in the Cradock-, Somerset East Region in the Eastern Cape reported serious mortalities apparently due to Avian Influenza (bird flu).
On request, samples were sent to the Western Cape Veterinarian Laboratories and were provisionally diagnosed as the high pathogenic AI (which caused major mortalities in the East early in 2004).
The diagnosis has not been confirmed yet.
As the disease could pose a serious threat to the export of ostrich meat from the Ostrich Exports Abattoirs in the Western Cape, we have requested the Eastern Cape, not to send birds for slaughtering to the Western Cape, until we have more clarity on the infection.
The EU will immediately revoke our export status should the disease spread to the Western Cape.
A meeting between the NDA and the Department of Agriculture in the Eastern Cape was held on Monday, 2 August 2004 at Bisho, in order to discuss the situation and it was confirmed that a ban was put on the movement of ostriches from the Eastern Cape to the Western Cape.
By the end of this week we should have a much clearer picture of the type of virus concerned as well as the extent of the infections in the Western Cape.
Our most important priority is to protect the Ostrich Industry of the Western Cape.
It was therefore necessary to engage with disaster management in the Province and all systems were put in place with road controls and movement monitoring in the Karoo and Oudtshoorn areas.

Feedback from Cabinet Lekgotla
The Provincial Cabinet and Provincial Heads of Departments met this Tuesday and Wednesday in a Lekgotla in Saldanha Bay on the West Coast.
Arising from the Lekgotla, I am able to convey the following:
100 Days - 20 Deposit programme:
The 100 Days ends on Sunday, 5 September.
We are on track to success with all 20 Deposits on the people's contract in our Province as I announced them in my State of the Province address on 28 June.
These signify the developmental, pro-poor and legacy correcting commitment and approach of this Government.
Important markers amongst the 20 Deposits that must be noted include:
1. The arrest of the first alleged 'high flyer' criminal: Mujahid Daniels and successful opposition of his bail application.
He has been charged with drug dealing, perlemoen smuggling, murder and housebreaking.
We are on course with the other 'high flyer' within the 100 days programme.
2. Arising from the first successful conviction under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act [POCA], between 7 and 11 members of each of the Mongrels, Cisko Yakkies, American and Corner Boy gangs have been arrested and charged.
3. I will switch on the power at the last of the six schools to be electrified, St Boniface in Rietpoort on 31 August.
5. The new Railway Police will be deployed this January 2005.
6. A big surprise can be expected too in the total of HIV+ citizens receiving ARV therapy in our Province.
7. The Athlone Taxi Office has been opened
8. The Expanded Public Works programme will be opened by President Mbeki on 4 September
9. The launch on 1 September of Accessible Government
10. The Provincial Development Council amendment bill and Western Cape Youth Commission bill have been signed by Cabinet and will be handed to Parliament
11. The Clanwilliam Agricultural College, Augsburg for emerging farmers is being opened tomorrow
Each of these Deposits will be unrolled over the next month as we complete the first 100 days and secure the patience and goodwill of the people of the Province.
Unfolding the medium term:
We are concerned that the great backlog in our Province means that we can never allow iKapa elihlumayo, our strategy to grow and share the Cape to become a mere slogan.
To build confidence, it is essential that we focus on the medium term and underpin iKapa elihlumayo with the strategies, plans and frameworks needed to fight poverty.
We must also signal through our own confidence and work that the Western Cape is open for business.
Investors, businesses and entrepreneurs, both domestically and internationally have looked for these signs from us.
For the first time, our Province can anticipate integrated strategies including the following:
* Micro Economic Strategy
* Provincial Infrastructure Plan
* Spatial Development Framework
* Social Capital Strategy
* Human Resource Development Strategy
These will all be completed by June 2005 and will be reinforced by our health transformation programme: Health 2010, our preparations for the World Cup in 2010, our fight against crime, our transformation of the State and our empowerment drive in one harmonious plan to achieve our goal.
Terror threat:
I am reassured by this, as I know we all will be.
The Western Cape is safe and we have no reason to expect attacks.
I have every confidence in inviting visitors and reassuring citizens that we are still the safe part of the world that was acknowledged by the international community after 9/11.
It is unfortunate that this sort of reporting is casually relayed to the world, doing great harm to our efforts in terms of business confidence, tourism and relationships amongst us as citizens.
All people from the Western Cape, including the Muslim community are fully behind our Government's work to fight and poverty and to build the bridges necessary to the Home for All.
We need this inclusive climate to succeed.
We must recall too that even at the height of the urban terror that we experienced in the nineties, the state was able to limit human casualties and damage to a large extent.
This was followed by successful convictions.
Premier Ebrahim Rasool

Women and the Environment
13 August 2004
On Saturday, 14 August 2004 women from Driftstands, Delft and surrounding areas gathered at the Driftsands Nature Reserve, Environmental Education Centre to learn how to grow indigenous water wise gardens, how to make arts and crafts from recycled materials and be presented with interesting discussions about the environment.
Minister Tasneem Essop opened the event as it formed part of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning's (EA&DP) Women's Month Programme which aimed to empower women with skills they can not only use in their day-to-day lives, but also to create small businesses from.
The South African National Botanical Institute taught the participants how to get the best from the soil.
The department discussed the projects they will embark upon to empower women and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board Cape Metro Unit presented different types of plants, which can make a difference in daily living.
In addition to this, chainsaw-bearing women from Vusithemba (to awaken hope) demonstrated their work in cutting down alien vegetation and using bluegum trees to make recreational park facilities for their local communities.
The Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board Cape Metro Unit (WCNCB) and the National Botanical Institute (NBI), co-hosted the event.

Farmworkers in dialogue
15 August 2004
A historical moment in the lives of the farm worker community is taking place on 17 and 18 August 2004.
For the first time an opportunity has been created for the farm worker community to enter into a dialogue with role-players in Agriculture in order to become full partners in mapping out the future of Agriculture.
For much too long discussion about, for and on behalf of farm workers took place.
As Minister of Agriculture, I took the initiative to call a farm workers indaba on 17 and 18 August 2004 at Elsenburg with the aim of affording the farm worker community the opportunity to come to the table to talk for themselves.
The indaba will act as a point of departure in a bigger process in the interest of the farm worker community.
The aim of the indaba is to allow the farm worker community and the different Government structures, NGO's, Organised Agriculture and others to enter into discussions in a spirit of reconciliation to determine the gap between the service providers and the users.
Government departments will have the opportunity to introduce their policy frameworks and services.
On the other hand, farm workers will be able to raise their need for services and highlight the issues of concern.
Thus the theme: Farm worker in dialogue.
Topics such as rural education; economic empowerment; violence and safety; social structures and sport; the value of labour legislation; housing; health; women; children and disabled persons will be on the agenda.
The end result: Farmworkers in Action.

On Celebrating the Matrics of 2004 and Charting the Way Forward
BY: Mr Cameron Dugmore, Provincial Minister of Education
AT: Leewenhof, Cape Town
29 December 2004
Premier and Mrs Rasool
Fellow Cabinet Colleagues
Mayors, Councillors
SG, and other senior officials from my department
Representatives of Teacher, Governing Body and Student Organisations
I want to thank the many learners and parents who were able to attend at short notice such a joyous occasion.
I am sure the parents of the learners who were contacted yesterday by the department must have been very anxious and proud to hear they had been invited to the Premier's residence.
Congratulations to all our Matriculants who have passed.
You have made all of us proud, your parents and the communities you represent.
For those who were not successful, this is not the end of the world.
I want to encourage you to enrol for the supplementary examination before 18 January 2005.
Use every day you have to improve your skills.
Volunteer, work part time, read, teach, learn and discover every waking hour.
A new dawn is rising over us, over you and Africa.
Tomorrow will be better than yesterday.
And today, in these beautiful gardens of Leeuwenhof, where slaves toiled for their masters, we now hold the light which gives us hope.
This year the Western Cape achieved an 85% pass rate.
However, my Ministry is fully aware that the top performers have historically emerged from advantaged communities.
These learners have done the Western Cape proud.
Further, we realize that the pass rate fails to reflect the high percentage of learners who drop out due largely through socio-economic factors before they reach matric.
Hulle is die lig wat brand en nooit doodgaan nie.
In order to meet the enormous challenges we face in education, the department will seek partnerships with labour, business, local government, NGO's and other social partners.
We realize schools cannot operate in a vacuum and require wider, sustained support.
The new look Western Cape Education Foundation, which will be launched next year, will blend this partnership into a real vehicle for transformation, equity and quality.
Arguably the Western Cape government has been haunted by the spectre of apartheid for longer than other provinces, which has required my Ministry to challenge a deeply entrenched status quo.
Within a short space of time the Department of Education has initiated the following interventions:
* Stabilized the teaching profession by obtaining additional funding from the provincial treasury, to save 1,800 teaching posts and employ 365 more teachers next year.
I want to the thank the Premier, MEC Brown and my Minister, Minister Naledi Pandor, for their support in what was a difficult time.
* Laid the basis to increase the number of maths HG passes from 4,000 this year to 8,000 in 2009.
* Initiated a land audit of unutilised education property for possible alienation to generate additional funds to build the 65 schools we need, faster.
Furthermore, the Western Cape Education Department is committed to improving performance, enhancing accountability by doing the following:
* Making sure that actual teaching starts in all schools on 19 January 2005, the day school starts, and we will closely monitor the quality of tuition in schools at risk
* Redeploying some of our district and head office staff, including circuit managers, so that they will be optimally used and held accountable
* Reviewing the results of grade 8 to 11 to ensure throughput and ensure that the areas of maths, science and accounting are prioritised
* Aligning our human resource strategy so that it supports all bands of education and develops learners with knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to contribute to the provincial economy, fighting poverty and creating work
* Make sure every high school has a computer lab by the end of next year, and in partnership with Multi-Choice, equip our schools with a sattelite dish, television and VCR set.
I have asked each mayor to consider the allocation of a bursary or cash prize for the best overall matriculant in their municipality, as well as to the best maths, science and accountancy higher grade learners from historically disadvantaged schools in their towns.
I would like to thank those Mayors who have already taken up my request.
There is much to celebrate.
A significant number of our schools have increased the number of learners who passed the Senior Certificate from 2003 to 2004.
In some schools the numbers have increased by more than 30 learners.
This year has seen more learners enrolled for the Senior Certificate examination: 38,896 - which is an improvement on the last two years.
The further good news is that, although our percentage pass rate of 85% for 2004 represents a slight drop of 2,1% compared to 2003, all indications are that the quality of our education is steadily improving.
The number of candidates achieving endorsement, increased from 10,323 last year, to 10,524 this year - which is an increase of 201 learners.
The number of candidates who passed with Distinction, which is an aggregate of more than 80%, increased from 2,170 to 2,202 - which is an increase of 23 learners.
Premier, there are also some good news on the subjects of mathematics and science.
In 2003 we had 3,938 candidates who passed maths on the higher grade.
This year we have increased it to 4,268, which is an increase of 330 learners.
In 2003 we had 3,892 learners who passed physical sciences on the higher grade.
This year we have increased it to 3,937, which is an increase of 45 learners.
This confirms that the standards of our education is high, and challenges the notion that only a well-resourced school is capable of delivering quality education.
The schools, which have contributed to the increases in numbers on the quality indicators, are from the entire spectrum of school types - former model C schools, former House of Representatives and former DET.
In this respect the number of endorsements from former DET schools has risen from 270 in 2003 to 390 in 2004 and the number of higher grade maths candidates from 78 to 136.
Wel gedaan!
An increasing number of former model C schools have also, via admissions, opened their doors to large numbers of Coloured and African learners and have continued to achieve outstanding results.
Here I wish to mention the Sans Souci Girls' High School, which has achieved over 75% endorsement rate over three years.
This school, which will be honoured later has 46 Coloured matrics, 5 White, 18 African and 12 Indian.
My Latin tells me that Sans Souci means without equal.
The opportunity you have given black female learners is indeed worthy of emulation.
In this respect I also want to mention the efforts of Settlers and Pinelands High schools.
I am also proud of the achievements of schools such as Harry Gwala, HoËrskool Robertson, HoËrskool Ladismith, Augsburg Landbou Gimnasium, Groot Brakrivier HoËrskool, Swartberg SekondÊr en Diazville HoËrskool.
Therefore, today we not only celebrate the achievements of the candidates and schools, but also pay tribute to the principals, the teachers and all our communities, for their contribution towards growing the Western Cape as a Learning Home for All our Children.
Premier, this is a tangible reflection of the commitment of the WCED and our communities to your call for this province to be a Home for All.
This year the WCED has chosen to reward improvement or consistency of performance while maintaining or increasing Grade 12 enrolment levels.
As it is our intention to ensure that learners continue through to Grade 12, learner numbers in Grades 8 to 11 over the previous four years will be tracked.
All schools, including independent schools, entering candidates for the Senior Certificate examination of the WCED were eligible for awards.
But Mr Brian Schreuder from my department will explain all of that to you.
In addition, the SG will honour a new school in Kraaifontein who have truly, in two short years, made great strides towards quality.
Our students in Khayelitsha have shown improvement.
Quality is no longer the sole preserve of a few schools.
I must also mention to you that, this afternoon, the Presidential nodal zone of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha will play host at the Rocklands Civic Centre in Mitchell's Plain for an event to honour their top achievers.
As mentioned, I have also asked our Mayors in the different municipalities to do the same in the new year.
We are celebrating to reward, but also to encourage our learners to continue their education in FET Colleges, Technikons or Universities.
I have therefore approached various leading corporate citizens to assist with government's efforts in building a learning home for all our children, by providing promising matrics with financial assistance who want to enter the fields of science, maths and technology.
SAICSA, ETV, Checkers Shoprite, Master Maths, MECER computers are but some who have responded to our call.
I want to thank them for doing so.
I am looking forward to the challenges of 2005, to work with our schools, teachers and parents, governing bodies and unions, to continue improving the quality of education in this province.
We have a vision - a home for all.
We have a plan - iKapa elihlumayo and our job as education is to develop the HRD strategy to implement the plan and fulfil the vision.
Together we cannot fail.
African, Coloured, White and Indian, men and women, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Jew, we will make this province a home for all.
In conclusion, Premier and honourable guests, the smooth process of the administration of the exams and excellent results, is a reflection of the dedication, commitment and professionalism of the officials of our department under the leadership of the Superintendent-General Ron Swartz, Deputy-Director General Brain Schreuder, Chief Director Penny Vinjevold, Director of Curriculum Development Jenny Rault-Smith, Director of Examinations AndrÉ Clausen, and many other directors and staff of our Education Management and Development Centres.
I want to thank them for their efforts and hard work.
But most importantly, I want to thank the 28,500 teachers and 8,000 public servants on whom we depend to deliver education to our learners.
We have done well.
We have improved quality.
Our historically disadvantaged schools are doing it.
But there is work to be done.
Let us bring the dawn quickly.
Let us take the stars from the sky.
Darkness, your days are now few, for we have the light in our hands, together.
I thank you...

Cape Town Job Creation Groups and Premier's Wife Charity Fund Team up to Provide Children with Patchwork Blankets
3 February 2004
This project was started about six months ago as an initiative of Mrs Van Schalkwyk.
The blankets are manufactured by Western Cape job creation groups such as the Chrysalis Academy in Tokai and the Christian Women's Action Group in Eerste River.
These groups are compensated by the Premier's Wife Charity Fund with money generated through fund-raising events, while the material for the blankets is mostly donated.
Material has already been donated by, amongst others, a well-known Cape Town clothing designer and a leading children's clothing store.
"We decided on blankets, since they not only serve a practical purpose, but also provide children with a sense of safety and security - even more so when the children are ill and needy.
At the same time much-needed jobs are provided to groups who are empowering themselves and others.
Participants have the opportunity to donate their entries to charity, and to win an Elna Funstyler sewing machine or 500 Keedo vouchers.
The closing date is 31 May 2004.
Any job creation group that would like to become involved, or people who wish to donate material, batting or blankets, or wish to sponsor a blanket for R50, may call Mrs Jorietha Henn at tel. (021) 483-4705/6.
The first blankets will be handed over at 10:00AM on Tuesday, 3 February 2004, at Nazareth House, Derry Street, Vredehoek.
All media are welcome.

Opening of Provincial Parliament Address
BY: Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, Premier of the Western Cape
AT: Cape Town
9 February 2004
Choosing the Path of Unity for the World Class Province
Introduction
We have great cause for celebration.
There has never been a better moment to be a South African, and there is no better place to live in South Africa than right here in the Western Cape.
Consider for a moment how far we have come, and how fast we have moved.
Ten years is barely sufficient time for the maturation of a great wine; it is less time than it takes to educate a child; it represents one 80th of the age of the giant Outeniqua Yellowwood that towers above the Tsitsikamma Forest.
Yet we have accomplished more to bring human dignity to millions in the first ten years of South African democracy than was accomplished in the ten decades that preceded them.
We have seen communities rejoined, hope restored and the creation of a new strength grounded in our determination to build our future together.
The power of the Western Cape lies in the character and disposition of its people.
Through hardship and success in our history our people have been formed with stamina, a determination to survive and to live, deeply and loayally rooted in our province and our country.
For centuries there were diamonds that lay buried under the shifting dunes at Kleinsee and Alexander Bay, hidden for generations from those who had no idea of the wealth beneath their feet.
Like those diamonds, the hidden potential of our people lay untapped for decades.
There were flashes of hope, and those who occasionally rose above their restricted opportunities to shine.
It has only been in the last ten years of real freedom, however, and in the last two years when our coalition has governed for all the communities of the Western Cape, that the potential of our people has been truly unearthed.
In our commitment to build a World-class Province, we are busy discovering and unlocking the brilliance of rough-diamonds in communities and areas like Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and the Karoo.
For the first time the talents of all our people are being harnessed in this building process, and this is a treasure that we must guard with great care.
Speaker, the people of the Karoo and Namaqualand understand the effects of drought.
They know too that just below the surface of the Earth lie the seeds in which rests the sleeping potential of their region.
With the first rains, even after years of drought, these seeds germinate and this world that was dry and bereft of life becomes a garden of vitality which sustains and supports its people.
And this is the way the people of the Western Cape are.
Our people's character and disposition enabled them to survive trying times and hardships.
And with the coming of the first rain, that potential of our people and our province opened up into something that grows vigorously, in which everyone can share, and that can only reach new heights.
But it is only the beginning of blossoming, and now that the rain has started to fall we should ensure that nothing will spoil the crop.
People of the Karoo know that in that region you find the eight-day grass.
The moment it rains, you can bet on it that within eight days the eight-day grass will flourish.
Sheep are once again hopeful and run after the new green grass.
But the people of the Karoo also know that this represents a false hope, for although the eight-day grass may look fine and green, its nutritional value is very low and it cannot last.
In the Kalahari one also finds the N'abbas.
This is a Nama word for a mushroom-like delicacy.
It remains under the ground waiting for the right circumstances to grow and to be harvested.
Otherwise it disappears again for years.
If the N'abbas does not get rain in March, its vitality will never break through the surface.
And if it is not picked early in winter, it will be nipped by frost.
In the Karoo and in Namaqualand there is also the gannabos.
This bush is tough as leather and has a high nutritional value.
The gannabos can also be compared with the symbol of the Griqua people, the kanniedood - a symbol of the Griqua people's ability to keep on growing and to become stronger in spite of hardship.
During the drought the plant seems to be dry and lifeless, but as soon as the rain starts to fall, it seems to come to life again.
In times of hardship it loses its bloom, but its roots are anchored so firmly in the earth that in the right conditions it may reappear year after year.
In the Western Cape we are indeed showing our character just as the gannabos and the kanniedood do.
Now that the rain has started to fall and the conditions are right, the road we have chosen is not one that will bring our people just eight-day grass - in other words only temporary relief and false hope.
Economic growth without job creation and sustainability is not good enough for our people.
By introducing the right plans at the right time and implementing them with discipline, we will treat our people to N'abbas - the best delicacy there is.
Our plans are aimed the establishment of stability and sustainability - dignity for all our people - anchored with vigorous roots as those of the gannabos and kanniedood.
Speaker, our Government represents all the people of the Western Cape.
No longer are we divided.
Today we have a Government in the Western Cape that governs for all the people of this province.
We are illustrating that coloured, white, black and Indian South Africans succeed best when working in partnership to build our shared future.
A charge to keep
I was greatly moved this morning to be greeted by so many children of the Western Cape - from every community - their voices united in song, their faces united in hope, and their futures united in and by South Africa.
Ten years old, they are our free-born generation - the most concrete and powerful expression of how far we have come in the first decade of South African democracy.
Last February I committed our Government to making 2003 a year of implementation and delivery, to laying the ground-work for addressing both our short-term challenges and their long-term causes.
We introduced iKapa eliHlumayo to promote growth in the Cape so that everyone may share in it - the best vehicle to drive our policies and our actions for the next decade. iKapa eliHlumayo is our vehicle to carry every community with us on the path to being a world-class province.
This is our charge to keep.
During the past two years our Coalition of Hope has established a stable platform in the Western Cape.
This Coalition is an anchor creating security for foreign and local investors - investors whose partnership we deeply appreciate in the growth and development of our economy so that we may create jobs for our people.
Long-term planning horizon
Apart from stability and breaking down the barriers between our communities, the greatest contribution of this Government to the future success of our province has been the introduction of a long-term planning horizon - putting into place 10 and 15 year plans to address the underlying causes of many of our most serious challenges.
It is fitting that we are able to report, in the last two years of the first decade of democracy, that we have excelled in the creation of solid foundations for expanding our service delivery and building lasting human dignity in the next decade.
Unemployment, migration and job creation
Ensuring the future for our generations to follow requires us to seriously and urgently address the issues of unemployment and poverty.
Our provincial population has grown from just less than 4 million in 1996 to well over 4,5 million according to Census 2001 - mainly as a result of migration from other provinces.
This means that our provincial population has been growing by about 2,9% annually, compared to national population growth of about 2,1%.
More significantly though, the economically active population in our province grew almost twice as fast as it did in South Africa as a whole.
Amongst the most important issues addressed at our recent Cabinet Bosberaad was the need to agree, with our social partners, on micro-economic strategies for the province to meet our targets.
Within five years we will ensure R5 billion's new investments and at least 100 000 new job opportunities.
We also intend to create 120 000 short-term job and training opportunities by means of extensive public works programmes by 2008.
A delivery-focused MTEF budget with fiscal discipline
Madame Speaker, Minister Rasool and his Departments have presented us with a focused and priority-driven budget that concentrates our spending on the implementation of iKapa eliHlumayo.
Ours is a budget emphasising both targeted poverty relief and the development that the Western Cape needs for sustained economic growth and job creation.
Our budget embraces real fiscal discipline.
We will not mortgage the future of our free-born generation for short-term gains.
In addressing the backlogs of our past, this Government, in our Medium-term Budget Policy Statement, has reduced the budgeted deficit from more than R434 million in 2003/04 to R366 million in 2004/5.
Healthcare 2010
Under the leadership of our Provincial Minister of Health, Piet Meyer, Healthcare 2010 was approved by the Provincial Cabinet in March last year.
Healthcare 2010 is designed to ensure that instead of a R1 billion health deficit by 2010, the people of the Western Cape will see improved services.
The end result is projected to be an increase in our capacity by an additional 2 million primary health visits every year by 2010.
Amongst the many other successes in health care over the past year has been the in-principle approval of up to US$66 million over five years from the Global Fund to fight HIV/Aids; and the roll-out of our Prevention of Mother-to-child Transmission of Aids Programme to 100% of pregnant women attending public health clinics.
Budget pressures on the Social Safety Net, Health, and housing delivery
It is important, Madame Speaker, for us to understand both the scope of the challenges and the budget pressures facing Ministers Meyer and Fransman, and their Departments, partly as a result of migration, partly because of the restructuring of health care, and partly because of the expanded need for social grants.
The number of social grant beneficiaries has increased from about 362 000 in December 2001 to more than 502 000 this month - and it is projected that the number will reach 550 000 by next year.
The single largest driver of this growth is the increase in child support grants - this month we already have 42 479 children between the ages of 8 and 9 receiving these grants.
We believe that by the end of the next financial year, more than 93 000 children over the age of 7 will be benefiting from these grants.
Similar challenges are experienced in our rendering of health services - whereas migration to the province alone necessitates the building of up to three new clinics every year.
Apart from this, and the fact that an analysis by the National Department of Health indicated that increased financing - amounting to about R150 million per year - for the Western Cape is justified, the ever decreasing conditional allocation for tertiary health services will most probably result in a deficit of about R160 million in real terms.
Minister Hangana and her Department of Housing are facing comparable challenges.
In spite of our having almost doubled the Housing Budget from R271 million in 2001 to R514 million last year, we are unable to keep up with the demand.
We must address the under-spending of our Housing Budget.
This is a country-wide problem because of new national legislation and regulations, as well as a lack of capacity at local government level, but we must also rectify the situation in the Department of Housing so that everybody pulls in the same direction.
Against the background of these pressing budget issues, the Western Cape Government will be engaging constructively this year with the National Government on the composition of the equitable share formula, and the extent of conditional grants arising out of national policy.
The new Draft Strategy for Human Resources and Skills Development
Speaker, we understand that quality education is the key to job creation.
The resulting report and recommendations, combined with Minister Gaum and his Department's Vision 2020, will help us to break down the so-called 'silos of learning', emphasising an integrated approach to all provincial education from pre-Grade R, through formal schooling and tertiary education, to work-place learning, Adult Basic Education and Training, and life-long learning.
Last year's increase in the matric pass rate for the third year in a row, to a record of 87,1%, indicates that our education and training initiatives continue to bear fruit.
BEE Conference and Provincial Growth and Development Summit
The Western Cape broke new ground in May last year when we were the first province to host a conference on black economic empowerment to set the tone for the implementation of iKapa eliHlumayo.
In the Western Cape black economic empowerment should also include brown economic empowerment.
The Black Economic Empowerment Conference also gave real impetus to the first-ever Provincial Growth and Development Summit which we hosted in November with our social partners.
By bringing together Government, business (including agriculture), labour and the community (including women, the youth and the disabled) we achieved not only a framework agreement as the basis of a new social accord for the province, but also reached consensus on the macro-economic strategies for the province.
Strategic Infrastructure Plan
Government realises that our growth strategy must be backed by the necessary physical infrastructure.
That is why Minister Essop and her Department are busy with the last finishing touches to our Strategic Infrastructure Plan to strengthen our growth sectors and to direct our expenditure in the first place towards the most critical infrastructure.
This will, by means of construction work, also provide job opportunities in the short term and the transfer of knowledge in our poorest communities.
Our key aim is to increase the levels of investment in key social and economic infrastructure from the current 1,1% of GDPR to 2,5% by 2008.
To address the estimated R1,4 billion backlog in provincial road infrastructure and maintenance, we will also be pursuing with the National Treasury the implementation of a fuel levy in the Western Cape.
The feasibility report has been completed and the Province will embark on a process to consult with industry and the taxpayers through a public hearing process prior to any final representations being made to the National Treasury.
Increasing police numbers by 50%
Madame Speaker, at this very moment we are increasing the number of police officers from 12 000 to 18 000 in the Western Cape.
When our coalition government took office in late 2001, there were 11 833 police officers in our province.
Last year we announced that 3 212 new police recruits (64% of the national intake) would be added to the SAPS in our province.
There are currently more than 16 000 officers protecting our communities and we are well on track to boost this number to 18 000 by the end of this year - a more than 50% increase in just two years.
Next month alone will see a further 1 700 new recruits in the province, with another 900 due in May.
We have done this to break the grip that criminals have on some of our neighbourhoods, and to secure the streets for our generations born in freedom.
That is why we have had the safest festive season in a decade.
I would like to congratulate Minister Ramatlakane, Provincial Police Commissioner Petros, the men and women of the SAPS, our EMS and traffic staff, and every volunteer whose hard work led to this outstanding achievement.
Murder dropped by 34%, robbery was down 24% and total crime fell by 18,2%.
With other policing initiatives like the roll-out of 36 new CCTV cameras at a cost of R11 million to new areas like Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, the strengthening of our Child Protection Units around the province, and our plans to train neighbourhood street committees this year, we are turning the tide against crime.
Officially breaking the barrier of 1 million overseas tourists
For the first time in history more than 1 million foreign tourists travelled to our province last year, thereby boosting our local economy directly by about R17 billion.
This is attributable to Minister Witbooi and her Department, whose efforts to ensure long-term tourism growth are already bearing fruit.
With milestones like the opening of the Cape Town International Convention Centre, the successful staging of the Cricket World Cup Opening Ceremony and the golfing President's Cup, increased numbers of direct flights to Cape Town, and our plans to launch our Western Cape Tourist Guide Registration System in the next two weeks, tourism in the province is on the move.
We also plan to pass the new Western Cape Tourism Act this year and to launch our new Destination Marketing Organisation (DMO).
It is clear that tourism, as one of our most important growth sectors, is poised to reach even greater heights in 2004 with projected growth of about 6%.
We remain committed to our target of attracting 3 million tourists a year by 2010.
Fast-tracked and sustainable land reform
Since August 2001 there have been more than 4 400 beneficiaries of agricultural land reform in the Western Cape and we are planning to have this number increased to 7 000 in the next few years.
Minister Gelderblom and his Department, in partnership with the National Government, have also succeeded in ensuring that 54% of these beneficiaries are women and 40% young people, making land reform one of the most important tools of direct empowerment in our province.
To ensure their long-term success, we have also opened a new agricultural training centre at George.
This will be followed by the opening of a similar centre at Oudtshoorn early this year, and a third at Vredendal next year.
Renewed urban and rural development focus
Speaker, guided by Minister Dowry, the Provincial Cabinet has now approved the business plans for the ongoing development of Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha through the Urban Renewal Programme.
In partnership with the City of Cape Town we will be developing central business districts in these two development nodes to a value of more than R580 million over five years.
We will also be renewing our focus on rural development in areas like the Central Karoo, to ensure that our provincial growth benefits all Western Cape communities, and not only those in urban areas.
In the past year we have also made much progress in strengthening the cooperation and coordination between our Provincial Government and the municipalities of the Western Cape.
Our efforts to bring development and increased opportunity to our areas in greatest need have also been a focus for Minister McKenzie and his Department.
Through major events like the Cricket World Cup and also through grass-roots initiatives like the Sports Stepping Stones Project, we continue to bring all communities onto the path to world-class quality.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Madame Speaker, many of us living in the Western Cape fall into the trap of forgetting how good life is in our province.
We forget that the inflow of people from all parts of South Africa, and from around the world, is testimony to our ongoing success.
We forget that we have every right to be proud of the Western Cape and that we should be proud to live and work here.
That said, we must always remember that much work still needs to be done to raise the standard of living for thousands in our poorest communities.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation to the leader of our coalition partner in Government, Minister Rasool.
Nowhere has it been more apparent how positive this coalition is for the Western Cape than during our Provincial Imbizo Focus Week and the Presidential Imbizo last year, where the people of the province in vast numbers endorsed our Government and expressed their appreciation for our willingness to work together in the interests of their communities.
I also take pride in the public service in our province under the leaderhip of our Director-General, Dr Gilbert Lawrence, and the Heads of Departments.
The people of the Western Cape can be proud to have the about 68 000 extremely competent men and women in our public service, and on behalf of the Government and the people of the province I wish to thank them.
Tonight at a gala dinner in Paarl we will honour our public servants for their excellent service during the first ten years of democracy.
In remembering our first decade of democracy, and in celebrating our first free-born generation, we should also remember that the challenges we must still face will be overcome through the same strong partnerships that have brought us this far.
When black, white and coloured people take hands and put their heads together, we succeed best in improving the lives of all.
Let us join hands to build our world-class province.
Together we are securing a fair share for our sons and daughters in the Western Cape.

Premier Welcomes Investments of R 2.13 Billion to Cape Town
19 July 2004
Premier Ebrahim Rasool has welcomed the national launch of the Icon development at the International Convention Centre tonight at 19h30 as another sign of increasing investor confidence in the Western Cape and in Cape Town.
Euro-Cape [Mandela - Rhodes Square]: R 500 million
COESSA [Icon]: R 350 million
Mitchell's Plain Promenade: R 300 million
Khayelitsha CBD: R 300 million
Film studio: R 460 million
Budget Insurance Call Centre [Century City]: R 100 million
Parliament upgrading: R 120 million
TOTAL: R 2.13 billion
"This excludes purchases and transactions, the capital value of new leases signed and upgrades to existing buildings.
"This R 2.13 billion is a major installment on the R 5 billion that we undertook to bring to our Province at the Growth and Development Summit last year.
As a Government we are committed to doing our part as we build the Home for All.
"It is good to see cranes lining the city horizon as a sure sign of progress and confidence.
The construction industry is back in business to build on the skills of the Province and to provide much needed work.
"It is most encouraging for the long term that this new wave of development in the city is characterised by four important features: mixed use principles, racial and social integration, black economic empowerment and architectural innovation.
"We welcome the commitment to mixed-use development by COESSA and Euro-Cape amongst others.
The deliberate inclusion of commercial, retail and residential facilities in development initiatives reflects the best of current international planning models.
"Cape Town has a painful history of separation still clearly reflected in racially divided residential areas.
The racial and class integration of our physical spaces is essential to secure and expand the Home for All.
The fact that the historic city centre is playing a leading role in bringing our people together instead of serving merely as a centre of established wealth is very encouraging.
"The development of the Icon by 100% black owned COESSA will be a signpost to black economic empowerment.
This state of the art 20 storey development on land reclaimed from the sea in 1937 is one of the first of its size being undertaken by a black company.
"We are particularly excited that the name 'Icon' refers to a 'Wall of Rememberance' inside the building.
This presentation will celebrate the leaders who have made achievements such as this possible in a free South Africa.
In the context of our vision of becoming a 'Home for All, this is a highly appropriate gesture.
"The use of contemporary architecture with African references will help transform the face of the city as the architectural treasures of the past stand juxtaposed with the new as symbols or reconciliation, understanding and progress.
"There are two concerns arising from these important developments:
"Firstly, that the movement of the CBD toward the Waterfront in the west through developments such as the Convention Centre and Icon must be balanced.
We are committed to development on the eastern side of the CBD as District Six is restored and revitalised and the development of the southeastern metropole through new projects including the Film Studio, Mitchell's Plain Promenade and Khayelitsha CBD.
"Secondly, that prices should not prohibit access in an environment where wealth is still related to race.
As a Provincial Government we welcome the debate on the peopling of District Six, gentrification of areas such as Bo Kaap and property prices as we find means to counter this."

Effects of stronger Rand on Agriculture
22 July 2004
The exchange rate appreciation has positive implications for some industries, while negatively affecting others.
The state of agricultural markets affects everything from the income of farmers to the trade balance.
Well over half of the country's agricultural exports originate from the Western Cape and with 60% of the Western Cape agricultural produce intended for export markets, the fluctuation caused by the Rand's position against the major currencies will in the long-term impact on the Western Cape economy.
Agriculture is the only industry, which has gained and created jobs.
Statistics have also shown that the average numeration of farm workers in the Western Cape is 25% higher than the average for South Africa.
A stronger Rand has the possibility to change all this.
In the long-term a stronger Rand coupled with the current draught situation will necessitate structural changes in order to achieve the objectives of iKapa elihlumayo - the growing Cape.
Research by the Department of Agriculture's economists at Elsenburg has shown that free monetary and commodity markets still holds the most advantages for the economy, but there is an urgent need for effective strategic planning, financial risk management systems and the requisite contingency planning.
This research has also pointed out that parties that have a direct interest in the exchange rate of the South African currency should re-organize their businesses in order to accommodate the volatile nature of world markets and the exchange rate.
We will together with other role-players monitor the situation very closely and the fluctuation caused by the Rand's position against the major currencies will be a point of discussion at the Western Cape Agricultural Summit scheduled for later this year.

24 March 2004
Not one community in the Western Cape has not been affected by the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP).
For this reason it is a privilege to hand over a cheque of R3,4 million to the mayor of the Central Karoo District Municipality for infrastructure projects in Murraysburg.
These funds have been allocated from the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme and will contribute to the following projects: The upgrading of storm water drainage, new high mast lighting, upgrading of sport facilities, and the upgrading of the main sewage pump station.
All over the Western Cape, communities experience the presence of CMIP.
Currently 154 infrastructure projects with a total value of R247,02, in all phases of construction are implemented.
In the current financial year the Department of Local Government is managing R183,7 million in the CMIP programme.
105 projects with a value of R166,4 million are under construction.
30 projects with a value of R54,5 million are in the design and tender phase and
2 projects with a value of R17,2 million are in the approval process.
CMIP funds are allocated to the seven project categories (water, sanitation, roads, solid waste, community facilities, community lighting and storm water).
Through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme, the Department of Local Government, will continue to develop and upgrade infrastructure for the disadvantaged communities.
The aim of CMIP is to build communities through infrastructure provision laying a solid foundation for the provincial vision of iKapa elihlumayo: Hope, Delivery & Dignity in the next decade.

Laingsburg - Provincial Government Is Committed To The Finalisation Of Process - Upgrade Of Cemetery
25 March 2004
SOURCE: Ministry of Local Government and Housing (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
Last year the provincial government of the Western Cape was involved in a process of thorough investigations to refute allegations over the existence of an alleged mass grave in Laingsburg after the 1981 floods.
Although the further handling of this very sensitive issue is vested with the Laingsburg Municipality it is in the interest of the broader Laingsburg community that the provincial government not only acts in a reconciliatory manner, but is also actively engaged in the upliftment of a town which was deeply divided by these allegations.
At present the municipality is busy with the development of a tourism centre and flood route, as a tourist attraction, for the town and to stimulate the economy of the region.
Phase one will comprise a tourism bureau/museum, conference rooms, kiosks, etc. Also included is the construction of an obelisk as proposed by Cabinet.
The funding for phase one is provided in total by the national Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.
The municipality is currently awaiting the rolling over of the funds.
To take the process of reconciliation and healing in the Laingsburg community forward the Provincial Government of the Western Cape has requested the Municipal Council of Laingsburg to consider upgrading the former coloured cemetery where eight victims of the flood were buried.
This will ensure that these graves receive the same recognition as the memorial cemetery where most of the victims were buried.
Today the provincial government is proud to hand over an amount of R200 000 from the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) to the Municipality of Laingsburg for the upgrading of the Göldnerville Cemetery.
This amount is a contribution to the total cost of R250 000 which will include water supply to the cemetery, the planting of trees, a 200 m access road, an entrance wall to the cemetery, store facilities as well as ablution facilities.
In accordance with one of the goals of CMIP local labour will be utilised and it is estimated that 1 620 person days of work will be provided, of which at least 30% will consist of women.
It is a privilege to be part of the process with the conclusion of this Laingsburg chapter.
Our Government was determined from the start to achieve three things for the Laingsburg community: truth, reconciliation and closure.
It is in the interest of the broader Laingsburg community that all spheres of government now work together to achieve closure.
-In addition to this very important symbolic cheque handover it is a pleasure to announce that an amount R1,3 million has been approved for Göldnerville and Bergsig in Laingsburg for the rehabilitation of roads and related storm water.
With high unemployment in this town it is estimated that this project will provide 3 520 person days of work.

Nurses Day, 12 May 2004
12 May 2004
Statement by the Western Cape Health Minister, Pierre Uys on Nurses Day, 12 May 2004.
The nursing profession the world over has produced some remarkable people.
Florence Nightingale is an international household name.
In the Western Cape we boast with Machelle Crystal Gordon, runner up in the National Cecilia Makiwane Awards and Alec Nicholas Alexander, Western Cape nominee in the National Marilyn Lahana Trust Caring Award, to name but two local achievers in the nursing profession.
In the Western Cape 22 nurses have already received provincial awards.
Nursing has for years been a desired and honourable profession drawing dedicated volunteers from all walks of life.
Today the nursing profession is a highly skilled one requiring trained nurses in a variety of disciplines.
I support Nurses Day because I believe that we, as a nation, need to pay tribute to our thousands upon thousands of nurses fulfilling their pledge of service in hospitals and clinics throughout the country.
It is a pledge of service to humanity honoring the noble tradition of the profession of always putting the total health of the patient first.
Health services throughout the world face the challenge of nursing shortages.
South Africa, with its high training standards, produces a sought after nursing fraternity.
We need to revisit our nurses' retention strategy if we are to stem the flow of nursing skills leaving the country.
A first priority would be creating better working conditions including an improved salary and allowance structure.
We cannot afford to lose precious nursing skills desperately needed in our own facilities through a perceived attitude of not caring.
May Nurses Day serve its purpose to emphasise our high regard of the nursing profession.
I give our nurses the assurance that the Western Cape does care for them.
We need you, we admire you and we honour you.
You are truly people who feel called to serve your fellow beings.
We thank you for your loyalty to your profession.
I know it is not loyalty alone that pays the bills at the end of the day, but be assured that I will fight for a better deal for all our nursing staff.
Ends statement.
Note to eds:
Cecilia Makiwane was the first registered black nurse to be recognized by the Government almost a century ago.
The awards seek to motivate and inspire nurses by recognizing and rewarding excellence.
The Marilyn Lahana Trust Caring Award recognizes outstanding members of the nursing and midwifery professions.
The award commemorates Marilyn Lahana, a nurse who died in 1996 after contracting the Ebola virus from a patient.

Visit to De Doorns - Alledged Buldozing of Workers' Houses
18 May 2004
During the course of last week a very disturbing report about a farmer in De Doorns who allegedly bulldozed the houses of farm workers, appeared on television.
I decided to visit De Doorns on Monday in order to establish all the relevant facts regarding this matter.
I spoke to various role-players which included the landowner, an official from the Department of Land Affairs, Coucillor Freddie Speelman and the executive of the Hex Valley Table Grape Association.
During my visit I also inspected the alleged demolished houses.
All the relevant parties agreed that the report on television news last week was one sided and contained a lot of unsubstantiated allegations with regard to the incident.
This unfortunate type of biased reporting is detrimental to the building of sound relations within the Agricultural sector.
It is evident that there is a willingness amongst most of the role-players to find a workable solution in order to enable the farmer, Mr de Villiers to proceed with the planned grading of 80 housing units to the benefit of the occupants as well as the broader community of De Doorns.

Statement by Western Cape Health Minister Pierre Uys Commemorating Child Protection Week, 24 - 30 May 2004
24 May 2004
Children are something very special to us as parents and it is therefore a commitment of the Western Cape Health Services to provide the best possible protection and care services to our youngsters says Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, in a statement.
The statement was issued today on the eve of World Child Protection Week starting on Monday and ending on Sunday
"Our health workers are specially trained to identify the violation of child protection legislation and to act accordingly.
Our health workers are constantly on the lookout for even the most minor signs of possible child abuse.
When children are identified as victims, the health worker will immediately start an investigation and inform the parents.
"When children are suspected of being an Aids victim, the parents are briefed and the necessary tests are recommended.
In cases of sexual abuse or rape, anti retrovirals will be provided.
Aftercare and counseling for both the victim and parents will be provided.
Social workers are also informed as well as the police."
More than 43 400 children younger than 4 years died of HIV/Aids last year.
In the Western Cape the health department has already succeeded in providing all infected mothers and newly born babies with anti retrovirals.
"Children who suffer burns are treated at our special burns unit at the Red Cross Children's Hospital at an annual cost of R40 million.
Such children and their parents are counseled and where necessary, rehabilitation programmes are introduced.
Burns are the biggest cause of injuries and deaths amongst children under 4 years.
It will, however, need a special team effort from all of us to prevent burns and other unnecessary accidents if we want to save our children's lives."
More than 1 400 children die before they reach the age of one and another 5 000 die before the age of 14 as a result of preventable accidents in South Africa every year.
Helplines partly financed by the province, are also available.
There is a Child Care Centre with a toll free number (0800 05555 55), there is Safeline (021- 638 1155), the Child Welfare Association in Cape Town (761 7130), a social services child and family service at Grabouw (859 2283) and at Paarl (862 6182), a child care centre at Worcester (032 - 347 0190) and Lambertsbaai (027 - 432 2639) and Rapcan, an organization in Cape Town (448 9034) which focuses on the prevention of child abuse and neglect.
"We are proud of what our health services are doing for our children.
The protection and care of our children is, however, not just the function of the authorities.
And this should not only be our aim during the coming week, but for as long as we have children.
It is a duty, which we as parents have tasked ourselves.
We may never fail in our duty," says Uys.
Ends.

International Nurses' Day
12 May 2006
"The wellbeing of our patients in our facilities receive the highest priority and the treatment they receive must be compared with the best in the world.
This is only possible though, if we create circumstances wherein our nurse personnel can deliver service of the highest quality." said Minister Uys.
Minister Uys paid tribute to the unselfish task nurses deliver daily, during a gathering of nurse personnel.
"I know that the pressure on nurses increases every day, but I am comforted by the positive inclination of our nurses across the entire province." said Uys.
"The Western Cape is also, like the rest of the world, suffering from a serious shortage of sufficient nurses, but every day we are busy working on creative and purposeful solutions." said Uys.
Minister Uys announced that the Department of Health made good progress to create a Directorate for Nurse Services and that the post will be advertised soon.
The Directorate will be responsible for advice to the department and the coordination of nurse related issues.
There will also be focused on the concerns dealing with service provision.
Minister Uys also mentioned other areas where they are working hard to improve the working environments of nurses:
* Frequent meetings with a representative nurses' managing committee where matters like overtime payment and rare skills subsidies are being dealt with.
* The upgrading and extending of facilities to create a friendly working environment like the large projects currently taking place at the hospitals in George, Worcester, Paarl, Stikland and Vredenburg.
* The awarding of more bursaries for nurse students.
This year 2,948 bursaries were awarded.
* The replacing and upgrading of equipment.
In the current financial year the department spent R174m on new medical equipment.
* Nurse welfare programs are in place to cope with pressure and stress, to give emotional support and even to help with household problems.
Minister Uys said that on national level, he is part of a process that has progressed very well to look at the improvement of professional nurses' salaries.
It is time that our nurses are better remunerated for the unselfish service they deliver.
"There is no doubt that enough nurses can be directly equalised to better treatment of patients and thus lower casualties.
I am appealing to young people to consider a career in nursing.
This is an exciting career with many facets and offers the opportunity for promotions, especially if you enjoy working with people." concluded Uys.

Paying Income Tax
* What is Income Tax?
* Who should register for Income Tax?
* SITE and PAYE
* Tax returns
WHAT IS INCOME TAX?
Income tax is the money you pay to government from your wages to pay for roads, schools, hospitals etc.
The amount of tax that you pay depends on:
* How much you earn.
* Your age (whether you are under 65 or over 65).
* Whether you are a member of a pension fund or pay towards a retirement annuity fund.
Examples of income on which you can be taxed include:
* income from employment eg. salaries, wages, bonuses, overtime
* fringe benefits and certain lump sums
* income from a business or trade
* investment income eg. interest, rental income, and foreign dividends
* annuities
* pensions
* income from your own business.
WHO SHOULD REGISTER FOR INCOME TAX?
* A person earning an annual salary of over R60 000 a year (PAYE employees) - after deductions of contributions to pension funds and retirement annuities
* A person earning less than R60 000 a year (SITE employees) - only when allowances (travel, medical aid etc) are included in their remuneration
* A person earning investment income (interest) of more than R11 000 per year
* A person earning rental income
* A person earning business income
* A person who receives a travel or public office allowance as part of their salary
* Members of Close Corporations and Directors of Companies
You can register for income tax at a SARS office by completing an IT 77 form.
You will need a copy of your ID and an IRP5 form.
Your registration will be confirmed within 21 working days and you will be issued with a tax reference number.
SITE AND PAYE
There are two main types of tax that are deducted from an employee's salary or wages:
* SITE (Standard Income Tax on Employees)
* PAYE (Pay As You Earn).
If you earn more than R27 000 per year, you pay SITE tax which is deducted from your salary every week or month.
Your employer must work out how much needs to be deducted.
If you earn more than R60 000 per year, you will pay SITE tax on the first R60 000 and then PAYE on everything that you earn over and above R60 000.
The amount of PAYE you pay depends on how much you earn and is calculated from tax tables issued by the South African Revenue Services.
TAX RETURNS
Once a year, your employer will give you an IRP5 tax certificate that shows the total amount that you earned and the total tax that was deducted.
If you earn more than R60 000 a year, you need to complete a tax return and send it with your IRP 5 certificates to SARS.
You must register with SARS before you complete a tax return.
If you are already registered, your tax return forms will be sent to you in the post.
You can also collect the forms from your nearest SARS office.
You can also receive and submit your tax returns electronically using the the SARS eFiling system. eFiling is an electronic tax return and submission service.
You can register for eFiling if you are already registered as a tax payer.
You will need your tax reference number and ID number.
You will receive detailed instructions on how to complete the tax return with the forms.
When you submit your return SARS will check that you have paid the correct amount of tax.
If you have paid too much tax you will get a refund.
If you have not paid enough tax you will be asked to pay the outstanding amount.
You can also collect a copy of the forms from your nearest SARS office.
You can be fined or imprisoned if you are found guilty of:
* tax evasion (i.e. not paying your income tax )
* not completing an income tax return
* not disclosing all your income on your income tax return.
For more information, visit the SARS website, call the Western Cape Call Centre at 0860 12 12 18 or contact your nearest SARS office.

Applying for a Visa to Visit South Africa
The visa states the purpose and duration of the visit.
REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTERING SOUTH AFRICA
Before you will be allowed to enter South Africa, you need to have:
* a valid and acceptable passport / travel document which covers the period that you intend to stay in the country
* a valid visa, if required
* sufficient funds
* a return / onward ticket
* a yellow fever certificate if you are travelling through the yellow fever belt of Africa or South America.
WHO NEEDS TO APPLY FOR A VISA?
People who do not have South African passports need to apply for visas.
This includes people who want to come to South Africa for a holiday or for business.
However visitors who have passports from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (including the British Islands Bailiwick of Guernsey and Jersey, Isle of Mann and Virgin Islands, the Republic of Ireland as well as British Overseas Territories) are totally exempt from South African visa control and do not need visas for any purpose.
Also, visitors from certain other countries are exempt from the visa requirements under certain conditions.
WHERE CAN YOU APPLY FOR A VISA?
If there is a South African diplomatic or consular representative in your country, then you must submit your visa application to them.
If there is no South African diplomat or consulate in your country, you can send your application to:
Director-General: Foreign Affairs
ARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICA
Remember you cannot apply for a visa when you arrive in South Africa.
Once you get to the South African port of entry, e.g. Johannesburg International Airport, you will be given a temporary residence permit, which replaces your visa and states how long you may stay in the country.
This temporary residence permit (TRP) must be kept valid and an application for extension (BI-159) can be submitted at any regional or district office of the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa.
HOW TO APPLY FOR A VISA
To apply for a visa, you need to:
* submit the application form
* show your passport (or provide certified copies if the application is posted)
* provide two passport photographs
* pay the R425.00 or US$47 or £43 visa fee, if applicable (refer to the list of countries subject to visa fees)
* show that you have booked an air ticket.
If a business visa is applied for, you also need to provide a letter of invitation from the South African company to be visited, as well as a letter from your company.
For more information on how to apply for a visa to visit South Africa, contact your nearest South African diplomatic or consular representative or visit the Department of Home Affairs website.
There is a R425, US$47 or €43 application fee for visitors from certain countries.

Home > Directories > Services > Tourism & Travel > Travel > Yellow Fever Certificates
To prevent the spread of yellow fever, travellers crossing the borders of countries where yellow fever is prevalent need to be vacinated against the virus.
WHAT IS A YELLOW FEVER CERTIFICATE?
Yellow fever is a virus carried by the Aedes mosquito that leads to death in about 25% of patients.
There is no specific treatment, but vaccination is very effective.
International law requires travellers crossing the borders of countries where yellow fever is endemic to have yellow fever vaccinations.
After you have been vaccinated you will be issued with a Yellow Fever Certificate.
The certificate only becomes valid ten days after vaccination, and stays valid for ten years.
If you have travelled in a Yellow Fever region in the six days before you wish to visit South Africa, you will have to show your Yellow Fever Certificate when you enter the country.
IS ANYONE EXEMPT FROM THE VACCINATION?
Pregnant women, babies under one year old and people who are allergic to the vaccine and to eggs do not have to have the vaccination.
You will still have to get a certificate from the vaccination centre saying that you have been exempted.
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CERTIFICATE?
If you arrive in South Africa without a valid Yellow Fever Certificate, you will be:
* kept under observation for six days at your own cost, or
* vaccinated against yellow fever at your own cost.
If there is no Port Health Officer at the point where you enter the country, you will be refused entry into South Africa.
YELLOW FEVER REGIONS
The following countries are Yellow Fever regions:
Central Africa Republic
Democratic Republic of Congo
Equatorial Guinea
Ethiopia
Suriname
Somalia

Home > Directories > Services > Tourism & Travel > Travel > Foreign Exchange Allowances
WHAT IS FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALLOWANCE?
The Reserve Bank controls and monitors all money that leaves and comes into the country.
Part of this exchange control programme is that when you travel overseas, you can only exchange a certain amount of money for overseas currency.
HOW MUCH IS THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALLOWANCE?
The annual travel allowance is R160 000 for adults and children over the age of 12.
Children under the age of 12 are granted an annual allowance of R50 000 each.
There used to be a separate holiday and business allowance but this no longer exists.
The annual allowance applies to all forms of travel during the year.
The allowances are valid for a calendar year from 1 January to 31 December.
Your allowance is determined on the date of departure.
If you do not use your entire allowance during the year it falls away - you cannot accumulate allowances from one year to the next.
You can use your full allowance in any way you like, including foreign cash, credit card, draft or traveller's cheques.
CAN YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE
If the R160 000 allowance is not sufficient for the year, you can apply to the Reserve Bank for an additional allowance.

Claiming Unemployment Insurance
* What is the Unemployment Insurance Fund?
* How does the Fund help employees?
* How much money can workers claim?
* Can you get an extension when you have used up your benefits?
WHAT IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND?
The Fund offers short-term financial assistance to workers when they become unemployed or are unable to work because of illness, maternity or adoption leave.
The Fund also assists the dependants of a contributing worker who has died.
All workers who work for more than 24 hours per month (except public servants) must contribute to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
Workers pay 1% of their salaries every month.
Their employers contribute a further 1%.
It is the employer's responsibility to deduct the worker's contribution from their salary and pay it to the Fund along with their contribution.
The employee does not need a card or any other proof that they have contributed to the Fund.
HOW DOES THE FUND HELP EMPLOYEES?
Employees who are registered with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and who have been paying contributions to the Fund, can claim from the Fund if they lose their jobs or cannot work.
There are five kinds of benefits covered by UIF:
* unemployment benefits
* illness benefits
* maternity benefits
* adoption benefits
* death benefits.
You can claim unemployment benefits if you have been dismissed or retrenched or if your contract has expired.
You cannot claim if you have voluntarily resigned from your job.
You can claim illness benefits if you are off work due to illness for two weeks.
Benefits are paid from the date on which you stopped working.
Maternity benefits can be claimed if you are pregnant and take maternity leave.
You can take maternity leave at any time from four weeks before the expected date of birth and you may not work for six weeks after the birth.
You can claim adoption benefits if you legally adopt a child younger than two years old and you leave work to look after that child.
Only one of the adopting parents can apply for benefits.
The wife/husband or minor child of someone who has died can claim death benefits if the deceased paid contributions to the Fund.
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN WORKERS CLAIM?
If you have been contributing to the Fund for four years or more, then you can claim for up to 238 days.
If you have been contributing for a shorter period, then you can claim 1 day for every 6 days that you worked while you were contributing to the Fund.
If you take maternity leave, you can only claim up to 121 days.
The Fund pays a percentage of the wage/salary that you earned while you were contributing to the fund.
The highest amount that can be paid is 58% of what you earned per day.
CAN YOU GET AN EXTENSION WHEN YOU HAVE USED UP YOUR BENEFITS?
If you have used up your benefits and you are still unemployed or you are still ill, you can apply to have the UIF benefits extended.
If you are still unemployed, you need to complete form UF139 listing all the places where you have tried to find work.
This form must be submitted to the Department of Labour.
If you are still ill, you need to fill in form UF140.
Your doctor will have to complete the medical certificate that forms part of this application.
If the Department of Labour thinks that there are good reasons for you to get more benefits, then they will approve the application, but this does not happen often.
It may help if you can show that:
* You are actively looking for work.
* You depend on the UIF benefits for necessities like rent, food and water.
* You had contributed to the fund for more than four years.
There are different procedures for claiming the various benefits available:
CLAIMING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
If you want to claim from the Fund you need to go to your nearest Labour Centre.
There you will be asked to sign the unemployment register.
You will be told when you need to come back and sign the register again.
You will have to sign every four weeks to show that you still need to claim the UIF benefits.
You must go back to the office and sign the register on the correct date.
If you are ill, you must take a doctor's certificate with you to the labour centre.

As of April 2003, all domestic workers who work more than 24 hours a month need to be registered for UIF.
This includes part-time and full time domestic workers.
If domestic workers are not registered with the fund and if employers and domestic workers do not pay the monthly contributions the Department of Labour can issue heavy fines.
If a domestic worker is working for more than one employer, all of their employers must contribute to the Fund.
The Fund can provide different kinds of benefits:
* Unemployment benefits - A domestic worker who contributed to the fund and whose employment has been terminated can claim. (Note: You cannot claim if you resign from your job.)
* Illness benefits - A domestic worker who can't work because of ill health can claim for 6 months.
* Death benefits - If a domestic worker who contributed to the fund dies, their dependents can claim.
* Adoption benefits - A worker who contributes to the fund who is adopting children below two years of age can claim if they take unpaid leave to look after the child.
* Maternity benefits - A domestic worker who is pregnant claim maternity benefits before and after the child is born.
The amount that you can claim depends on how long you have been contributing to the fund.

Home > Directories > Services > Employment > Claiming Compensation for Occupational Injuries or Diseases
WHO CAN CLAIM WORKER'S COMPENSATION?
The Compensation Fund covers workers who:
* were hurt in an accident while they were busy with their work
* contracted a disease through their work
* died from a workplace accident or occupational disease.
You can claim if you were injured or contracted a disease while
* working (permanent or casual)
* completing an apprenticeship
There are certain categories of worker who cannot claim from the fund.
For example, you cannot claim if you are:
* a domestic worker employed at a private home
* a member of the South African National Defence Force (there is a separate fund)
* a member of the South African Police Services (there is a separate fund)
* a worker who doesn't work under the control of your employer
* a worker who works outside South Africa for more than 12 months at a time.
You can claim if you are:
* a domestic worker in a boarding house
* an apprentice or trainee farm worker
* a worker paid by a labour agency.
Claims will only be paid if they are submitted in the correct way in the proper time.
Claims will not be paid if:
* The claim is made more than 12 months after the accident or death, or after the disease is diagnosed.
* You are off work for 3 days or less.
* The accident resulted from your own wrong doing (Unless the worker is seriously disabled or dies in the accident, then the Fund will still pay compensation).
* You unreasonably refuse to have medical treatment.
WHO PAYS INTO THE FUND?
Employers pay into the Compensation Fund once a month.
WHAT INJURIES AND DISEASES ARE COVERED?
The Fund covers occupational diseases and workplace injuries.
Occupational diseases are illnesses caused by substances or conditions that the worker was exposed to at the workplace.
You can claim compensation if you are exposed to these working conditions and then get the related disease.
The working conditions and diseases caused by these conditions that are covered by the Compensation Fund are set out in Schedule 3 of the Act.
You can claim for other disease if you can prove using medical evidence and reports that the disease was caused by conditions at work.
The Fund also covers injuries that were sustained as a result of work or at the workplace.
WHAT CAN BE CLAIMED?
There are five kinds of compensation:
* Temporary disability
* Permanent disability
* Death
* Medical expenses
* Additional compensation
The Compensation Fund does not pay for pain and suffering, only for loss of movement or use of your body.
The amount of compensation that will be paid to the worker depends on how much the worker was earning when the injury was sustained or the disease diagnosed.
If you are have stopped working by the time a disease is diagnosed, the compensation will be worked out according to what you would have been earning.
TEMPORARY DISABILITY
What is temporary disability?
Temporary disability is when you are unable to work or cannot do all your work because of an injury or disease but you will get better.
To claim for this, you need to be put off work by a doctor for more than three days.
If you are put off work for longer than three days, you will get paid out for the whole time that you are unable to work (including the first three days).
What do you get paid?
If you cannot work at all, you will get paid out 75% (¾) of your normal monthly or weekly wage.
If you can only do some of your work, you will still get paid some wages by your employer.
The Fund will pay you 75% (¾) of the difference between what you got paid and what you would have been paid before the injury.
All medical expenses are also paid if the accounts are submitted to the Commissioner.
How long can you claim for?
You can claim compensation for temporary disability for 12 months.
This can be extended to 24 months.
After 24 months the Commissioner may decide that the condition is permanent and grant compensation on the basis of permanent disability.
PERMANENT DISABILITY
What is permanent disability?
A permanent disability is an injury or illness that the worker will never recover from, for example, losing an eye.
The serious of the disability will determine whether the worker will never be able to work again or whether they will find work more difficult.
Disabilities are rated from 100% to 1% depending on the seriousness.
For example, a 100% would be the loss of both your hands or the loss of your sight.
The loss of your small toe is a 1% disability.
Your doctor will write a medical report about the disability.
The Commissioner and various other doctors will then decide how serious the disability is.
How much compensation do you get?
If the disability is more than a 30% disability, you will get paid a monthly pension.
The size of the pension depends on what your wages were and on the seriousness of the disability.
If you have a 100% disability you will get paid 75% (¾ ) of your wages.
If the disability is less serious, the following formula is used to work out the monthly payment: [wages * (75 ÷ 100)] * (disability% ÷ 100).
If the disability is less than a 30% disability, you will get paid a lump sum.
How long will the compensation be paid for?
The lump sum payment is a once off payment.
The monthly payment will be paid for the rest of the worker's life.
DEATH BENEFITS
If the bread-winner in your family was killed by an occupational injury or disease, you can claim from the Fund.
How much can you claim?
The amount of compensation that you will be paid depends on your relationship to the deceased.
The total amount paid to the family cannot be more than the pension the deceased worker would have received if he/she was ¾ of the worker's wages per month.
The spouse will be paid:
* a lumps sum of 2 x ¾ of the worker's wages
* a monthly pension for life of 40% x ¾ of the worker's wages.
The worker's children under the age of 18 (including illegitimate, adopted and step children) are entitled to a monthly pension of 20% x ¾ of the worker wages.
This is paid every monthly until the child is 18 years old.
This pension can continue for longer if the child is mentally or physically handicapped.
If there is no spouse or children, other dependents will be paid compensation (for example, parents).
People who were fully dependent on the worker get the same as the widow.
People who were partially dependent on the worker get a once off payment that depends on how dependent they were on the worker.
The person who pays for the funeral expenses will be paid expenses up to R6 970.
To claim compensation for the death of a family member, you need to provide certified copies of:
* marriage certificate
* children's birth certificates
* death certificate
* declaration by the spouse (form WCL32)
* the employer's incident report
* funeral accounts (form WCL46)
* details of your income and property.
MEDICAL EXPENSES
All the medical expenses of a worker will be paid for up to two years from the date of the accident or the diagnosis of the disease.
All medical accounts should be submitted to the Commissioner.
This includes fees for transporting an injured employee to a hospital or to their home.
ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION
In addition to the general compensation, you can get extra compensation if the injury or disease was caused by the employer's negligence or a fault with a machine.
Any worker who is under 26 years will get extra compensation.
HOW DO YOU CLAIM?
1. Inform you supervisor or employer as soon as possible (verbally or in writing).
Make note of anyone who witnessed the accident.
The form that needs to be completed is WCL 2: Notice of Accident and Claim for Compensation.
2. The employer must then report the accident to the Compensation Commissioner, even if they doesn't believe the worker's story, by submitting Form WCL 3: Employer's Report of Accident.
The employer must report a workplace injury within 7 days or within 14 days of finding out that the worker has an occupational disease.
The employee should check that all the details on the form are correct.
3. Within 14 days of seeing the worker, the doctor must fill in form WCL4 stating how serious the injury was and how long the worker is likely to be off work.
This is sent to the employer who sends it to the Commissioner.
The worker does not pay for the doctor's fees.
But if you want a second opinion, you will have to pay for this.
4. If the injury will take a long time to heal, the doctor must send a progress report (WCL 5) to the Commissioner every month until the condition is fully stabilised.
This informs the Commissioner of how long the worker is off work.
5. Finally the doctor must submit a final doctor's report (WCL5) stating either that the worker is fit to go back to work or that the worker is permanently disabled.
The doctor must send this form to the employer who sends it to the Commissioner.
6. When the worker goes back to work, the employer must send a resumption report (WCL6) to the Commissioner stating when the worker went back to work and how much the worker was paid in compensation.
The worker and the employer should keep copies of all the forms.
When the first doctor's report has been submitted with the accident report, the Compensation Commissioner will consider the claim and make a decision.
A claim number will also be allocated.
This number should be used for all paperwork relating to a claim.
If the worker disagrees with the decision, they can appeal the decision within 90 days by submitting form W929 to the Commissioner.
PO Box 955
You can contact the Commissioner or any Regional Office of the Department of Labour for more information and for assistance.
Forms are available from:
Western Cape Office of the Department of Labour
PO Box 872, Cape Town, 8000
Fax: 021 462 0981
WHO PAYS THE CLAIM?
The Compensation Commissioner is appointed to administer the Fund and approves workers' claims.
The worker gets money from the Fund and not from the employer.
BUT the employer has to pay the injured worker for the first 3 months after the injury was sustained.
The Compensation Fund will pay the employer back.
If the worker is off for more than 3 months, the Compensation Commissioner takes over the monthly payments.
If the employer has insurance against workplace injuries then the insurance company will pay the compensation.
In these cases, claims are still made to and decided by the Compensation Commissioner.
NB: Payment of claims can take a long time to process.

Recreational fishing permits
PROTECTION OF OUR MARINE RESOURCES
The Act also tries to regulate who has access to marine resources to ensure that these resources are fairly distributed.
The law says that you need to pay for the right to exploit marine resources.
Money collected through licences and permits are used for research and marine protection programmes.
The following controls have been put in place:
* Some fish species are protected by a quota system which prevents people from catching or attempting to catch more than a certain amount of the fish.
* Certain species can only be fished in open season.
COMMERCIAL LINE FISHING RIGHTS
In 2000 an emergency was declared in the line fishing industry because of the collapse of a number of line fish stocks.
The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism declared that the number of vessels and crew would be limited.
Commercial fishing rights were allocated to full-time line fishers who depend on line fishing for their livelihood.
The allocations resulted in 376 fishing rights (2148 crew) being granted.
In total fishing rights will be allocated to no more than 450 vessels and 3450 crew.
Employers in the line fishing industry are now required to adhere to labour laws and provide security for line fishers.
After further investigation and consultations, exemptions will be granted to vessels historically associated with traditional fishing villages to fish for line fish.
RECREATIONAL FISHING PERMITS
Recreational and shore based line fishing is regulated by "bag limits" which prevent people from catching too many fish.
All recreational fishers are required to get recreational fishing permits.
You can get these permits from Post Offices countrywide at a cost of R50 for angling permits and R65 for abalone, rock lobster, spearfishing and other permits.
Permits are valid for a year, except for permits for species that can only be caught during season (these expire at the end of the season).
You should always carry your permit and your identity document with you when you are fishing.
You cannot sell fish caught under a recreational fishing permit.
For more information, call 021 402 3911.

Maternity and Paternity Leave
Female employees have a right to four months maternity leave.
This leave can start four weeks before the expected date of birth and the employee cannot be forced to go back to work for six weeks after the birth of the child.
An employee who bears a still-born child may remain on maternity leave for six weeks after the still birth or a longer period if a medical practitioner states that it is necessary for her health and safety.
Maternity leave may be paid or unpaid.
If the employee has been contributing to the Unemployment Fund, she will be able to claim benefits during the period that she is on maternity leave.
An employer may appoint a temporary employee to perform the duties of the employee while she is on maternity leave.
Fathers can claim three days family responsibility leave on the birth of their child.
Adoptive parents can each claim three days family responsibility leave on the adoption of a child.
If you are planning to take maternity or paternity leave, you should inform your employer of the expected date of the arrival of your child.
Employees on maternity leave also need to inform their employers in writing of when they expect to return to work.
Fathers and adoptive parents who want to take family responsibility leave may be required to provide proof of the need to take leave.

This means that even if the driver of the car doesn't have insurance, you can get money to help you pay for your medical expenses and to compensate for the time that you are unable to work.
The Road Accident Fund is a public entity which has been set up to pay compensation to people injured in road accidents or the dependants of people killed in road accidents arising from the negligent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.
The Fund gets its money from a fuel levy that is included in the price of petrol and diesel.
WHO CAN CLAIM FROM THE FUND?
* You can claim if you were injured in the accident.
* Your dependents can claim if you were killed in the accident.
* You can claim if you were involved in an accident as a driver, a passenger or a pedestrian.
There is only a claim if the accident was caused by someone else's negligent driving.
You cannot claim if you caused the accident.
You also can't claim if you were the only person and vehicle involved in the accident, for example if you drove into a pole.
If you were the driver in the accident but are not the owner of the car and the accident was caused by the owner of the car's negligence (for example, if they didn't fix the brakes) and you are injured, then you can claim from the fund.
WHAT CAN YOU GET MONEY FOR?
If you are injured in an accident, you can claim for:
* your medical expenses
* funeral expenses
* compensation for pain, suffering and disfigurement
* lost earnings
* Claims for loss of support - If the breadwinner in the family dies in an accident caused by someone else, then the dependants of that person can claim for loss of support.
If you were partly responsible for the accident then you can still claim but you will only receive a portion of the damages.
For example, if you were 50% responsible, then you will only get 50% of the damages.
If you were 25% responsible, then you will get 75% of the damages.
You cannot claim for damage done to your vehicle or property.
To get money for this, you need to sue the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident.
WHAT IS NEGLIGENCE?
You do this by proving that the driver did not drive their vehicle in a way in which a reasonable driver would have driven in the circumstances.
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU CLAIM FOR?
If you were not in the vehicle that caused the accident, there is no limit to the damages you can claim from the Road Accident Fund.
If you or your breadwinner was a passenger in the car which caused the accident, you cannot claim more than R25 000 altogether.
You can only claim back money that you have spent or will spend because of the accident, for example hospital and doctor's bills that you have paid.
If you or your breadwinner was a paying passenger or if you were in the car because of work, you can only claim R25 000, but you can sue the negligent driver for any money over that.
You cannot sue your employer, however.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR A CLAIM TO BE PROCESSED?
Claiming from the Fund is a complicated process and the Fund has a lot of claims to handle, so it can take a long time for your money to be paid out.
The Fund has 120 days to investigate the matter after the claim has been lodged, before the final proceedings can go ahead.
HOW DO YOU CLAIM FROM THE FUND?
You can claim from the Fund yourself or you can get a lawyer to claim for you but you will have to pay for their services.
There are information officers at all RAF offices that can help you free of charge.
You must make the claim within three years of the date of the accident, if you know who caused the accident.
If you don't know who the driver or owner of the vehicle that caused the accident was, you need to claim within two years.
You make the claim by completing the Claim Form (Form 1).
Every applicable paragraph must be completed.
The doctor that treated you immediately after the accident must complete the medical report section of the form.
You must also sign the form.
To make the claim, you need to have:
* A medical report.
* If a person was killed in the accident you must get an inquest record.
* A charge sheet from the police.
* All accounts, receipts and vouchers to prove medical expenses and hospital expenses.
* A letter from the doctor saying how much you will pay for medical expenses in the future, because of the accident.
* A drawing of the accident scene.
* The name of the police station where the accident was reported, the police case number and the police report.
* A letter from your employer to say how much money you lost through unpaid wages.
* A written consent to the hospital giving the Fund permission to look at your hospital records.
* A sworn statement from the person who is claiming and from any witnesses.

Municipal Rates
Municipalities are responsible for providing basic services to everyone living inside their jurisdiction.
* supplying water
* collecting and disposing of sewage
* supplying electricity and gas
* building and maintaining municipal roads
* stormwater drainage
* street lighting
* municipal parks and recreation.
In order to provide these services, the Municipality charges residents rates.
There are different kinds of rates, including:
* property rates
* water
* electricity.
WATER AND ELECTRICITY
These rates depend on your water and electricity consumption.
You will receive a monthly account that sets out how much you owe.
For more information on this, contact your local municipality.
PROPERTY RATES
Property rates are:
* taxes on the ownership of property (land and buildings)
* based on the market value of the property
* used to fund various services provided by municipalities.
Property rates are paid by owners of all kinds of real property, including commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural and government property.
Property rates are based on the municipal value of your property.
Property rates are set, collected, and used locally.
This means that the charges differ from area to area and that the money collected is spent in your municipal area.
The municipal value of your property is worked out by considering the market value of property, which includes land and improvements.
Professional, independent valuers registered with the South African Council for Valuers, whose job is to ensure that all properties are valued fairly and objectively, conduct valuations.
Once your property has been assessed, you can examine your assessment and appeal against it if you feel that it is unreasonable.
Your rates account shows the entire amount that you need to pay for the year.
Contact your Local Authority for more information.

AUTHOR: Department of Health
An informal questionnaire on coping with stress and answers to frequently asked questions about mental health.
WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?
Mental health is not merely about the absence of mental illness, but rather the presence of mental health and wellbeing.
Mental health is about how you feel about yourself, how you relate to others and how you deal with the opportunities, difficulties and challenges of everyday life.
HOW CAN I OPTIMISE AND MAINTAIN MY SENSE OF MENTAL WELLBEING?
Mental Health is about finding a balance between dealing with the difficulties in life and using the opportunities life presents for further development.
Get to know your Strengths (work at growing these) and Vulnerabilities ( work at overcoming or getting support for these) and learn to recognize when you are not coping and at risk for unhealthy stress.
COPING WITH STRESS
We may not feel mentally healthy or positive about life all the time.
Generally, our own strengths or resilience, with support from others, can assist us to bounce back from a crisis or stressful situation during which we are not feeling well balanced in our lives.
Some stress can be challenging and enjoyable (a new job, different responsibilities).
We need to guard against allowing our stress levels to reach the point where we are longer coping with daily lives
THE STRESS TEST
Test your level of stress.
Read through the questions below.
For each time you answer "yes", put a tick in the box.
Do you feel tired all the time?
Do you find it difficult to sleep
Do you suffer from headaches, ulcers or indigestion?
Do you find it difficult to concentrate?
Do you struggle to relax?
Have you lost interest in sex?
Have you lost interest in hobbies and other activities which you enjoyed?
Have you lost your appetite or are you eating more than usual?
Are you always late for work?
Do you avoid your colleagues?
Do you feel angry, irritable or "down in the dumps"?
Do you bring your work problems home with you at night and over weekends?
Are you making rash impulsive decisions?
Do you find it difficult to make decisions?
If you recognise yourself in the Stress Test, you may be suffering from job stress.
Most of us feel this way for brief periods at some point in our lives.
While there are no easy and quick fixes to some of the problems we have, it is best to take steps to reduce stress at work to regain or protect your mental health.
To take charge of the situation you can:
* Reset your priorities, where possible: Focus on the important things.
* Be realistic: Divide projects into manageable tasks, Recognise what you can/cant do.
* Get support: Identify people with whom you can share problem and work out solutions.
MENTAL ILLNESS
An important part of maintaining your mental health at home and work is to recognise when you have or may be at risk to develop mental health problems.
Information, and if necessary, assessment and advice about treatment may be obtained from your local community health centre, GP or occupational health nurse or clinic.
Private practitioners such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and clinical social workers may also be of assistance.
WHAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM OR MENTAL ILLNESS?
Mental health problems span a wide range of conditions, from milder conditions that could benefit from easily attainable changes in lifestyle and stress levels to more severe conditions which may require hospitalisation and ongoing regular treatment to enable you to manage every day life at home and at work.
Some conditions are more likely to appear at specific periods, for example post-natal depression in new mothers, mental deterioration (Dementia) in the elderly.
Others may appear at any phase of life.
HOW WILL I RECOGNISE THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS?
Below is a list of some signs and symptoms in 3 categories within the wide range of possible mental health problems we may experience, to help you do a spot mental health problem check!
Where these symptoms or other regular patterns of relating or behaving interfere with your performance at work or study and disrupt your and your loved one's family and social life, it is possible that you have a mental health problem that requires attention.
Depression
Anxiety
Psychosis
Do you ...experience feelings of panic, tension or excessive worry?...have fears of dying or losing control?...fear not being able to escape from places, and avoid leaving familiar places?...have feelings of unreality?...fear and avoid social situations?...become light-headed, breathless or dizzy?... have stomach pains, headaches muscle tension or feelings of numbness ortingling?...
Are there times when ......you hear voices, see images, feel or smell things which others do not seem to see?...your head feels empty of thought, your thoughts seem vague and unrelated and difficult to organise?...you have strong beliefs which others cant understand, for example, others want to harm you, or you have special powers and knowledge...you feel others can 'read your thoughts or you can read theirs....your emotional tone becomes 'flat'' or odd to others...your ability to manage daily personal hygiene and tasks deteriorates.
GETTING HELP FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM
People may avoid dealing with their mental health problem or emotional difficulties by "self medicating": They may do this by excessive use of over the counter or prescribed medication, alcohol or other drugs.
While this may provide temporary relief from symptoms, it can also lead to problems of addiction without addressing the underlying problem.
You may need help to stop if you have already started this practice.
People with mental health problems may not seek seeking the help they need, because of beliefs that mental illness is a sign of personal weakness, laziness, social unacceptability or "wishful thinking".
The facts are clear: Mental illness, like physical illnesses, can affect anyone.
Mental health problems are painful and can hurt as much as a physical injury, and it is best to obtain help early to promote the fullest possible recovery.
The sooner you obtain help, the sooner you may feel better.
The first step to obtaining help is to accept that getting help is the right thing to do!
Help or advice on where to go for your particular mental health problems may be obtained from your:
* school or religious counsellor
* local doctor
* local community health centre or mobile clinic
* workers clinic or health sister
* social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.
The mental directory of services can be consulted for other centers offering assistance

100 Day Deposits: The Home for All
28 May 2004
7 September 2004
The Western Cape was promoted as a home for all in the first 100 days, by
* Making government information on services more accessible to all
* Accelerating the legislative process for the Western Cape Youth Commission Bill and the Provincial Development Council Bill
* Intervening to ensure the re-opening of the Novel factory in Atlantis
CAPE ACCESS
Cape Access is aimed at provide the poorer people of our province (who cannot afford computers) access to computers, the internet, e-mail, and information on government services, currently found on the Cape Gateway portal.
Cape Access has two projects which hope to do this:
* The Rural Community Access Project
* The Libraries Project
* Bitterfontein
* Van Rhynsdorp
* Elim
* Struisbaai
* Bongaletu
* George
Simply making use of existing facilities may not always be sufficient, especially in areas where there are few facilities.
The Libraries Project is therefore aimed at the introduction of access to computers and the internet in libraries.
The libraries in the six e-community areas were technically assessed and three were chosen to pilot the Libraries Project.
Valuable lessons should be learnt in the piloting of these library projects, which will guide the expansion of the Libraries Project.
The libraries chosen in the 100 days are:
Premier Rasool encourages citizens to use Cape Gateway to access government information and services
Cape Access is a long-term programme.
Citizens without internet access can, however, already obtain access to the information on government services on the Cape Gateway portal by telephone (0860 142 142), or they can go to the walk-in centre at 142 Long Street, Cape Town.
LEGISLATION
The Western Cape Youth Commission Bill was introduced to the Provincial Parliament on 17 August 2004, within the 100 days of new government.
The Bill was then published in the Gazette for comment within 21 days.
Once this period is over, the relevant Committee will consider the comments received, before the final Bill is debated and passed.
The proposed Youth Commission's role will be to help government plan, monitor and evaluate the programmes of government in terms of outcomes as they affect youth.
Some 65% of the province's population is under the age of 35.
The Commission will also be responsible for promoting youth unity and patriotism and to serve as the connection with National, other Provincial and Local Government youth structures.
The proposed structure for the Commission is three full time members and not more than six part-time members, with a Chief Executive Officer.
The Provincial Development Council Law Amendment Bill was introduced to the Provincial Parliament and published in the Gazette for comment on 18 June 2004, within the 100 days of new government.
The Provincial Development Council is a statutory board tasked with the responsibility of co-ordinating, initiating and facilitating consensus among stakeholders in the province.
The amendment law is necessary to update the outdated law governing the council.
NOVEL FACTORY
When the Novel factory in Atlantis closed, some 300 employees were to lose their jobs.
The Premier's office became involved to secure financing for the purchase and re-opening of the factory by a black economic empowerment company.
The factory re-opened one day after the first 100 days of government.

Patients Rights Charter
This document spells out the rights and responsibilities of patients in term of health care.
For many decades the vast majority of the South African population has experienced either a denial or violation of fundamental human rights,including rights to health care services.
To ensure the realisation of the right of access to health care services as guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act No 108 of 1996), the Department of Health is committed to upholding, promoting and protecting this right and therefore proclaims this PATIENTS' RIGHTS CHARTER as a common standard for achieving the realisation of this right.
This Charter is subject to the provisions of any law operating within the Republic of South Africa and to the financial means of the country.

The Courts in South Africa
January 2003
AUTHOR: Jean Redpath
This document explains South Africa's court structure, and has contact details for the courts as well as links to their decisions online.
* Constitutional Court
* Supreme Court of Appeal
* High Court of South Africa
* Circuit Courts
* Special Income Tax Courts
* Labour Courts and Labour Appeal Courts
* Divorce Courts
* Land Claims Courts
* The Water Tribunal
* Truth and Reconciliation Commission
* Magistrates&rsquo; Courts
* Community Courts and Courts for Chiefs and Headmen
The Constitutional Court is the court which has the final say on all matters relating to the Constitution of South Africa.
Its decisions on the constitution are binding on all other courts.
There are nine judges who make up the court.
The head of the Constitutional Court is Chief Justice Pius Langa and the Deputy Chief Justice is Judge Dikgang Moseneke.
This court came into existence in 1994.
You can contact the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg:
Constitutional Court of South Africa
Braampark Forum II, 33 Hoofd Street, Braamfontein, 2017
Private Bag X32, Braamfontein, 2017
Tel: 011 403 8032
You can read the decisions of this court on the constitutional court website.
The Supreme Court of Appeal is the court which has the final say on all matters, except those that involve the constitution.
For example, all criminal appeal cases from the High Court end up in this court, unless the appeal relates to a point of constitutional law, in which case the Constitutional Court has the final say.
The Supreme Court of Appeal used to be called “The Appellate Division”, as it only hears cases on appeal.
Decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal are binding on all courts of a lower order.
The President of the Supreme Court of Appeal is the Honourable CT Howie and the Deputy President is the Honourable L Mpati.
You can contact the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein:
Supreme Court of Appeal
Corner Elizabeth and President Brand Streets, Bloemfontein
PO Box 258, Bloemfontein, 9300
Tel: 051 447 2631 / 6029
Fax: 051 447 8098
You can read the decisions of this court at the here.
The next of the “superior courts” is the High Court of South Africa, which used to be called “The Supreme Court”.
The High Court divisions have “jurisdiction” – the right to hear a case – over defined geographical areas in which they are situated, and the decisions of the High Courts are binding on magistrate's courts within their areas of jurisdiction.
The High Court divisions have jurisdiction over all matters in their geographical area, but they usually only hear civil matters involving more than R100 000, and serious criminal cases.
Important officers in a High Court Division:
* The Registrar keeps all the official court documents
* The Family Advocate must be consulted on all matters involving children, as the High Court is the “upper guardian” of all children in South Africa.
* The Master of the High Court keeps all the records relating to people's estates (deceased or insolvent).
* The Sheriff delivers certain documents to the parties in a civil case, and also attaches property when a warrant is issued.
* The Director of Public Prosecutions, who used to be called the Attorney-General, is responsible for criminal prosecutions by the state.
* The State Attorney is the lawyer who represents the state in civil actions (where the state is suing or being sued).
There are at the moment ten “provincial divisions” of the High Court and three “local divisions” (which have concurrent geographical jurisdiction over an area within a division).
These still use names which relate to the old provincial and homeland structure of South Africa before 1994.
For example, the division of the High Court in Cape Town is called “The High Court of South Africa: Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division and its Judge President is Judge John Hlophe.
The present thirteen divisions and local divisions of the High Court are situated in:
* Bisho (“Ciskei”)
* Bloemfontein (“Orange Free State”)
* Cape Town (“Cape of Good Hope”)
* Durban (“Durban and Coast Local Division”)
* Grahamstown (“Eastern Cape”)
* Johannesburg (“Witwatersrand Local Division”)
* Kimberley (“Northern Cape”)

Once the Superior Courts Bill is passed, there will be a division of the High Court in each of the nine provinces with a name matching that of the province, with some provinces have more than one “seat”.
Gauteng will have both a Southern (Johannesburg) and Northern (Pretoria) division.
You can contact the Cape High Court in Cape Town:
The High Court of South Africa: Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division
Keerom Street (Queen Victoria Street entrance closed), Cape Town
Private Bag X9020, Cape Town, 8000
Tel: 021 480 2411.
You can read the decisions of the court here.
Circuit Courts are also part of the High Court.
They are sit at least twice a year, moving around to serve more rural areas.
They can be contacted through the High Court.
The Special Income Tax Courts sit within divisions of the High Court and consists of a judge of the High Court assisted by an accountant of not less than 10 years’ standing, and a representative of the business community.
This court deals with any disputes between a taxpayer and the South African Revenue Service, where the dispute involves an income tax assessment of more than R100 000.
Appeals against its decisions are made directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Tax disputes involving an assessment of less than R100 000 go the Tax Board.
The Tax Board is chaired by an attorney, advocate or accountant who works in the private sector and is specifically appointed by the President to assist as chairman of the Board.
You can contact the Special Income Tax Court through the High Court and the Tax Board through the South African Revenue Service.
At present there also exist Labour Courts and Labour Appeal Courts, which have jurisdiction over labour matters and are on the same level as the High Court.
However, the Superior Courts Bill will abolish the Labour Courts and they will be absorbed into the High Court.
You can contact the Labour court through the High Court or by visiting the Labour Courts website.
Since 1998, Divorce Courts have been able to hear any divorce matters – prior to that these courts dealt only with divorces between black people.
There are three such courts, the Central, North Eastern and Southern Divorce Courts, and they are designed to deal with less complicated divorces quickly and inexpensively.
The Southern Divorce Court is the divorce court that has jurisdiction in the Western Cape, and it has offices at the Family Court Centre in Cape Town and a satellite office in Mitchell's Plain.
You can contact the Family Court Centre through the Cape Town Magistrate's Court.
The Land Claims Court is on the same level as the High Court but is independent of the High Court.
It was established in 1996 and hears cases dealing with the return of land taken away during apartheid (land reform cases).
The Land Claims Court has its own rules and is allowed to conduct its proceedings informally and inquisitorially (where the judge asks witnesses questions directly, rather than through lawyers) and the court can sit wherever it needs to, although its main office it in Randburg.
Appeals go to the Supreme Court of Appeal unless the appeal is on a constitutional question, in which case they go to the Constitutional Court.
The President of the Land Claims Court is Judge Fikile Bam.
You can contact the Land Claims Court in Randburg:
Land Claims Court
Trust Bank Centre, Randburg Mall, Corner of Hill Street and Kent Avenue, Randburg, 2194
Private Bag X10060, Randburg, 2125

The Water Tribunal is an independent body which has jurisdiction in all the provinces and consists of a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, and additional members.
It has jurisdiction over water disputes.
Members of the Water Tribunal must have knowledge in law, engineering, water resource management or related fields of knowledge.
They are appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, the body which chooses judges.
The Water Tribunal replaced the Water Court in 1998.
You can contact the Water Tribunal through the High Court.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was not a court as such but a different kind of forum set up to deal with crimes related to politics committed during apartheid.
The Amnesty Committee had the power to grant amnesty (which means the perpetrator cannot be prosecuted) for politically motivated crimes fully and truthfully confessed, under certain conditions.
The Human Rights Violation Committee decided on acts which constituted violations of human rights, based on statements made to the TRC.
Once victims of gross human rights violations are identified, they were referred to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, which decides on how to compensate victims.
Those who were not granted amnesty by the TRC for crimes committed during apartheid can be prosecuted.
The Magistrates’ Courts are the lower courts which deal with most matters.
They are divided into regional courts and district courts.
There are more than 400 magistrates’ courts in South Africa.
They do not have jurisdiction to deal with civil matters dealing with more than R100 000 (unless both the person suing and the person being sued agree to limit the claim to less than R100 000).
With criminal cases, more serious criminal matters are heard in the regional courts.
This is because district courts cannot pass a sentence of more than three years on conviction of an accused.
The most serious criminal matters are heard in the High Court.
There are also a number of magistrates’ courts that are specialised to be better able to deal with certain types of matters, such as the rape court in Wynberg.
You can view a list of Magistrate's Courts in the Western Cape here.
Small Claims Courts have jurisdiction to hear any civil matter involving less than R3000 (unless both the person suing and the person being sued agree to limit the claim to less R3000).
The judge in the Small Claims Court is called a commissioner and is usually a practising advocate, attorney or a legal academic who acts as a commissioner free of charge.
Neither the plaintiff (the person suing) nor the defendant (the person being sued) are allowed to have lawyers in the case.
The commissioner's decision is final and there is no appeal to a higher court.
You can contact your nearest Small Claims Court through your nearest Magistrate's Court.
Community Courts and Courts for Chiefs and Headmen also have jurisdiction to hear certain matters on the level of magistrates’ courts.
They are designed to deal with customary disputes in terms of customary law.
An authorised African headman or his deputy may decide cases using indigenous law and custom, brought before him by an African against another African within his area of jurisdiction.
These courts are commonly known as chief's courts.
A person with a claim has the right to choose whether to bring a claim in the chief's court or in a magistrate's court.
Contact your local chief if you want a matter heard in this court.

Breast Cancer Fact Sheet
AUTHOR: Department of Health (National)
A single fact sheet giving statistics and prevalence of breast cancer and the risk factors associated with this form of cancer.
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BODY AND BEAT BREAST CANCER
* Western Societies have the highest incidence of breast cancer, 60 -70 per 100 000 women.
* Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-dermatological cancer in women and currently the leading cause of cancer incidence among women in South Africa (16.6 %).
* It is the number 1 cancer diagnosis among the White and Asian female populations (17.9% and 24.4% respectively), excluding skin cancer.
* Between 1993 and 1995 an annual average of 3 785 new cases were diagnosed.
* Every woman is at risk for Breast Cancer.
The risk increase with age.
* Many risk factors have been identified for Breast Cancer.
However, all these only account for about 1/3 of the incidence.
All other cases remain unexplained, and are being researched through global initiatives.
* To date, knowledge about risk factors has not translated into practical ways to prevent Breast Cancer therefore the best way to reduce mortality from Breast Cancer is through early detection.
* Many theories suggest that possible causes include genetics, dietary, environmental factors, hormone activity or a combination of all three.
* Women find 9 Out of 10 lumps them selves.
* Most lumps (approximately 80%) are not malignant but occasionally a lump may be an early sign of Breast Cancer.
Any change however does need to be checked by a doctor.
* Breast disease is extremely common.
It starts off as a lump or thickening in the breast, which must be clinically examined.
* Breast Self-Examination (BSE) is the breast cancer screening method that you can use for yourself together with a breast examination by your doctor and mammograms (breast-x-rays).
* It is advisable for women over 40 years of age to have a mammogram annually.
* Breast Cancer Screening (Service)
* Breast Self Exam (Public Information)
Home > Publications > Public Information > U &gt Breast Self Exam
Breast Self Exam
This brochure contains reasons for doing a breast self examination on a regular basis.
REMEMBER
However, most lumps discovered in the breast are not cancer.
Be safe, be sure.
WHEN TO DO A BREAST SELF-EXAM
The best time to do a breast self-exam is right after your period, when your breasts are not tender or swollen.
If you do not have regular periods or sometimes skip a month, do the exam on the same day every month.
HOW TO DO A BREAST SELF-EXAM
1. Lie down and put a pillow under your right shoulder.
Place your right arm behind your head.
2. Use the finger pads of your three middle fingers on your left hand to feel for lumps or thickening.
Your finger pads are the top third of each finger.
3. Press firmly enough to know how your breast feels.
If you're not sure how hard to press, ask your health care provider.
Or try to copy the way your health care provider uses the finger pads during a breast exam.
Learn what your breast feels like most of the time.
A firm ridge in the lower curve of each breast is normal.
4. Move around the breast in a set way.
You can choose either the circle (A), the up and down line (B), or the wedge (C).
Do it the same way every time.
It will help you to make sure that you've gone over the entire breast area, and to remember how your breast feels.
5. Now examine your left breast using your right hand finger pads.
6. If you find any changes, see your doctor right away.
FOR ADDED SAFETY
You should also check your breasts while standing in front of a mirror right after you do your breast self-exam each month.
See if there are any changes in the way your breasts look: dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple, or redness or swelling.
You might also want to do a breast self-exam while you're in the shower.
Your soapy hands will glide over the wet skin making it easy to check how your breasts feel.

Cervical Cancer Fact Sheet for Health Workers
Health Programmes (Department of Health, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
AUTHOR: Reproductive Health Sub-Directorate
A fact sheet for health workers on the nature of cervical cancer, its prevalence, the age group of women most at risk and what can be done about it.
FACTS ABOUT CERVICAL CANCER
* Cancer of the cervix is the commonest cancer amongst South African women.
* One in 41 women in South Africa will develop this cancer during her lifetime.
* Cervical cancer is preventable by doing cervical smears, which can detect the abnormalities preceding invasive cancer, known as squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and previously known as cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN).
* Population based screening programmes in other parts of the world have shown to reduce the number of new cases of cervical cancer, even when the programs have been less than perfect.
* Younger women often present with low grade SIL.
Most of these abnormalities revert to normal on their own.
Older women with abnormalities, however, are more likely to go on to cancer.
* It takes approximately 10 to 20 years for precursors to become invasive cancer.
The recommendations of the national cancer screening programme, which has been accepted as official South African health policy, are that:
* Women aged 30 or more should have three free cervical smears.
These should be about ten years apart.
Screening as above has been shown to reduce the mortality from cervical cancer by 67% and is considered to be the most cost-effective option for South Africa.
* If a woman has specific symptoms or a previously abnormal smear or there are clinical indications, she may have free cervical smears in addition to the three.
* If a woman wants more than three routine screening smears, she must pay for the extra ones herself.
* If a woman is 55 or more when she has her first smear, and that smear is normal, no further smears should be done on her.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMME?
* Education of health personnel about the importance of cervical screening,
* Training of health personnel in the taking of smears,
* Ensuring the availability of necessary equipment
* Ensuring that good records are kept concerning the quality and
* outcome of smears, including a client recall system, and
* Follow up and referral of clients.
* Educating the community about the importance of cervical screening.

THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WESTERN CAPE
The Provincial Government Western Cape (PGWC) consists of 12 Departments, namely:
* Department of Agriculture
* Department of Community Safety
* Department of Economic Development and Tourism
* Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning
* Department of Health
* Western Cape Education Department.
Working with a budget of R16.4 billion (in 2004), these departments are responsible for implementing laws and providing services to the people of the Western Cape.
OVERVIEW OF THE WESTERN CAPE
The Western Cape is situated on the south-western tip of the African continent.
In total the Western Cape includes an area of 129 386 km².
There are approximately 4.2 million people, living in the province, the majority of whom are Afrikaans-speaking.
The other official languages are English and Xhosa.
The Western Cape makes the third-highest contribution to the country's GDP.
With over 170 000 people employed in the clothing and textile industry, this sector is the single most significant industrial source of employment in the Western Cape.
The official unemployment figure for the province, 18.4%, is substantially lower than that of most other parts of the country.
Information taken from South Africa Yearbook 2002/2003
CONSTITUTION OF THE WESTERN CAPE
The National Constitution permits each provincial legislature to adopt a constitution for its province.
The provincial constitution must correspond with the national Constitution.
The Constitution of the Western Cape was adopted in 1998 and is available in the official languages of the province, Afrikaans, English and Xhosa.
PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT OF THE WESTERN CAPE
The Western Cape Provincial Parliament is responsible for creating laws for the province within its realm of responsibilities as set out in the Constitution of South Africa.
These responsibilities include creating provincial legislation dealing with:
* welfare services
The parliament is housed in Wale Street, Cape Town.
There are 42 members and 24 seats are currently held by the ANC, 13 by the DA, 1 by the ID, 2 by the ACDP, and 1 by the UIF.
The current premier is Mr Ebrahim Rasool.
IKAPA ELIHLUMAYO
"iKapa elihlumayo", the Xhosa name for a Growing Cape, is the Provincial Government's underlying theme for the 2004/05 Budget and beyond.
This vision has been translated into an eight-point strategy that will guide government and its social partners over the next 10 years, to 2014.
These are also the eight strategies around which Budget 2004 is organised.
For more, there's a strategy document, an extract from the budget, and a pamphlet.

Protect Your Health (Pap Smear)
EVERY WOMAN OVER 30 SHOULD HAVE A PAP SMEAR
ALL WOMEN NEED A PAP SMEAR
What is a Pap Smear?
* A pap smear is a simple, quick vaginal examination to check if the cervix (the mouth of the womb) is healthy.
* A special instrument called a speculum is used to hold the vagina open so that the doctor or nurse can see the cervix.
* Some cells are gently wiped off the cervix and sent to a laboratory for testing.
* The results of this test will be sent to your clinic so remember to go back for your results.
Why Should I Go for a Pap Smear?
A pap smear detects abnormal cells that may later become Cancer of the Cervix.
What is Cancer of the Cervix?
* Cancer of the Cervix is one of the most common forms of cancer against women.
* Cancer of the Cervix if detected early can be treated and cured.
* All women are at risk of developing cancer of the cervix.
* The risk of developing Cancer of the Cervix increases as you get older.
* You are still at risk even if:
* you are not sexually active
* you are menopausal or have experienced menopause
* you no longer plan to have children
* you are sterilized
* you show no signs or symptoms.
When Should I Go for a Pap Smear?
* You should have a pap smear at least every ten years, starting in your thirties.
* You should have three FREE pap smears, one in your thirties, one in your forties and one in your fifties.
* These FREE pap smears are available at your nearest clinic or health center.
Your Health Rights
You are entitled:
* to three free pap smears in your lifetime, one every ten years, starting in your thirties.
* to be treated with dignity, respect and privacy when going for your pap smear.
* to ask your health provider to explain the procedure to you.
Your Responsibilities
* You must take responsibility for your own health.
* You must go back for the results of your pap smear.
* You must go for any follow up treatment if advised to do so.
* You must give the correct contact details to the health service providers so that they can you if you need further treatment.

PROVINCIAL TREASURY: OVERVIEW
Provincial Annual Performance and Strategic Plans
* Historical background
iKAPA ELIHLUMAYO
iKapa elihlumayo is Western Cape Province's strategy for addressing the needs of the people.
Its priority is to increase support to the poor, while at the same time ensuring that a larger number of people can gain income through paid employment.
The goals of iKapa elihlumayo are to reduce unemployment, poverty and income inequality by stimulating economic growth and participation in the province.
Greater provincial spending on skills development and investment in large infrastructure projects will be used to attract private investment and stimulate the economy.
The Province will balance this long-term strategy by increased support of the poor through the payment of grants and improved delivery of social services.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
South Africa's first democratic election in 1994 resulted in a new political dispensation with nine new Provinces.
But there were no provincial structures in place to bring about the necessary transformation.
We had to create a Province, and a key part of this was the creation of a working Treasury - so the Western Cape Provincial Treasury was born on 1 April 1995 as part of the new Finance and Corporate Services Department.
It was also charged with ensuring that similar governance structures came about in the Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces.
The running of the provincial government depends heavily on the proper functioning of the Provincial Treasury.
To ensure that the Western Cape was operating efficiently and effectively, the Department embarked upon a process of restructuring to synchronise its structure with the National Treasury.
The restructuring process required policy objectives and strategic objectives to be identified and brought into operation.
This was done by creating specialised components, such as Public Finance and Accounting, Asset Management, Human Resource Management and Resource Management.
This process was finalised during the first half of 2003 and included phases of:
* preparing and initial implementation of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)
* decentralising financial management
* preparing the Province for dealing with real delivery and intra-provincial equity
* building the Provincial Treasury to fulfil its role as an independent and professional department
* full implementation of the Public Finance Management Act.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES/FUNCTIONS
The current approved organisational structure should cater better for the Treasury's strategic goals and will help it to address the socio-economic challenges of the Province with the other departments, municipalities and other stakeholders.
The Treasury's (strategic) objectives are:
* To develop, implement and enforce financial norms and standards.
* To ensure effective internal and external communication on financial matters.
* To perform IT audits and conduct internal audits on a risk-analysis basis.
* To determine and evaluate economic parameters and socio-economic imperatives within a provincial and macro-economic context.
* To perfect the utilization of provincial resources, conforming to the nominal (basic) and substantive requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999.
* To enable financing of provincial obligations and ensure optimal allocation of resources to improve adverse socio-economic conditions in the Province and, though the intergovernmental fiscal system, to actively contribute to the same ideals at the national sphere.
* To ensure financial transaction processing and reporting that will fully reflect the financial position and performance of the Provincial Government.

Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Agriculture > Services > Agricultural > Funding & Support > Applying for a Grant from the Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) Programme
LRAD's main focus is to assist Black people to gain increased access to agricultural land, for use and ownership, by allocating grants.
These grants, which the State provides, are free and do not need to be repaid.
INTRODUCTION
THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN LRAD
LRAD tries to undo the injustice done to women in the past, with regard to access to and ownership of land.
Women are therefore now able to apply for the grant as individuals and not necessarily as part of a household.
HOW MUCH IS THE GRANT?
To receive the minimum grant amount of R20,000 the applicant must make a contribution of R5,000, while a contribution of R400,000 is required in order to access the maximum grant amount of R100,000.
The grant may be used to buy land, to invest in infrastructure, for short-term agricultural inputs, as well as for land improvements in cases where applicants already have access to land.
You can also apply for the grant if you are currently leasing land with the intention of buying it at a later stage.
ASSISTANCE WITH PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS
The Department of Land Affairs will ensure that applicants who require assistance are provided access to design agents, who will help with the planning and implementation of the projects.
The Department will pay the design agents appointed in this manner.
The grant that the applicants may receive will not be affected.
Applicants who possess the necessary resources to appoint and pay design agents may do so without prior consultation with the Department.
This will also be regarded as a form of own contribution to the project.
WHO QUALIFIES FOR THE GRANT?
Only South African citizens older than 18 years, from previously disadvantaged communities, will be considered for the grant.
Although applicants must preferably have agricultural experience, it is not a requirement.
Persons who had previously received a grant (R16,000) from the Department may apply again but priority will be given to first-time applicants.
The amount that a person qualifies for will depend on the level of grant previously received.
LRAD POLICY DOCUMENT
This document has been designed to assist readers with information about the LRAD programme, such as its objectives and its key features.
It will also assist readers in identifying whether they qualify to participate in the programme, and how they should go about applying for the grant that is available through this programme.
This document will also guide readers through the process or project cycle which is proposed for all LRAD projects and will introduce some of the terminology, concepts and institutional arrangements which form part of the LRAD programme.
The LRAD policy document is available in English and Afrikaans.
To apply for a grant, you need to submit an application form to the nearest office of the Departments of Agriculture or Land Affairs.
After officials from Agriculture have done an idea testing, the registration form will be sent to the district office of the Department of Land Affairs, where a planner will deal with the project.
Land Affairs and Agriculture officials will arrange information sessions with all role-players and where necessary, appoint a design agent to assist with project planning.
The Land Bank will administer the LRAD grant if applicants apply for Land Bank loan financing or wish to purchase a Land Bank property in possession.
Beneficiaries can then access LRAD grants directly via the Land Bank.
In this case, the completed application form must be handed in at the nearest Land Bank Branch or Satellite Office.
Once project viability has been proven, the Provincial Director of Land Affairs will authorise payment of the grant.
You can download the application and registration form for a LRAD grant in English and Afrikaans.

The primary objective of the SANDF is to defend and protect the territory and people of South Africa in accordance with the Constitution and the principles of international law.

* the preservation of life, health or property
* the provision or maintenance of essential services

The SANDF exercises its powers and performs its functions solely in the national interest in terms of the Constitution, 1996.

The South African Post Office has a social obligation to provide every household with an address.
It currently delivers approximately six million postal items per day to around almost three and a half million street delivery points and almost two million postboxes.
There are still over two million postboxes available for rent countrywide.The Post Office's current delivery policy stipulates that all first postal addresses are provided free of charge to clients - including farmers and owners of smallholdings.
The following are regarded as a first postal address:
* All areas where there is street delivery (regardless of whether the client wishes to use it or not).
* Address boxes in areas where there is no street delivery.
* Postboxes in areas where street delivery is impossible, for example on farms.
* Postboxes in areas where there is no street delivery, forcing clients to rent postboxes.
The following are regarded as a second postal address:
* If a client lives in an area where there is street delivery, but prefers to make use of a postbox.
* If a client lives in an area where postboxes are provided as a first postal address, but prefers to make use of an additional postbox.
Postbox rental applies from 1 January to 31 December of each year and is payable before 31 December.
A part of a calendar quarter is regarded as a full quarter.
When a postbox is rented, two keys are supplied on payment of a key deposit and the rental fee (if applicable).
The deposit is refunded once the service has been cancelled and both keys returned to the postmaster.
If a key is lost, the postmaster must be told immediately so that the postbox can be fitted with a new lock.
The postbox renter is liable for the cost of a new lock and keys (enquire from the postmaster for more information).
Bar-coded annual renewal notices for postboxes, address boxes and private bags are placed in postboxes on 1 November and must be submitted before 31 January to the nearest retail office.
Clients can still renew the postbox by getting a blank annual renewal form from the counter, if they have lost the bar-coded one.
Failure to submit the annual renewal notice and to pay the rental fee (if applicable) before 31 January will result in closure of the postbox.
The Post Office will redirect postal items, at a minimal fee, for clients who move from one place to the other if they complete the application form for the redirection of mail and submit it to the nearest retail office.

Non-Profit Organisations Registration and Funding
The Provincial Department of Social Development assists non-profit organisations (NPOs) with funding while the National Department of Social Development ensures that all NPOs are registered.
REGISTRATION OF NPOS
A non-profit organisation (NPO) may register with the NPO Directorate in the National Department of Social Development.
An NPO can be a trust, a company or any other association of persons, which has a public rather than a private purpose, and which does not operate for profit. (Not-for-profit means that the NPO's property or income is not paid out to its office bearers, except as payment for work done or services rendered.)
* Faith-Based Organisations (FBOs)
* Organisations that have registered as Section 21 Companies under the Company Act 61 of 1973
* Trusts that have registered with Master of the Supreme Court under the Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988
* Any other voluntary association that is not-for-profit.
There are a number of NPOs already registered in the Western Cape.
Registration of an NPO is not compulsory but voluntary.
Registration gives an NPO some legitimacy, and applications for funding, whether to government or other funding organisations, are more likely to be successful when an NPO is registered.
However, registration does impose obligations on NPOs, such as having to submit annual narrative and financial reports to the Directorate, and complying with a code of good practice.
FUNDING FOR NPOS
The Provincial Department of Social Development provides subsidies and programme funding for NPOs that provide developmental welfare services.
Any NPO can apply for this funding.
An NPO is more likely to be successful in its application if its services fall in line with the Department's Developmental Social Welfare Policy.
REGISTERING AN NPO
It does not cost anything to register an NPO.
Only NPOs that have a constitution or some other founding document can be registered.
The National Department has developed a model constitution.
To register an NPO, you need to submit an application form and two copies of your NPO's founding document (constitution, deed of trust, or memorandum and articles of association).
These need to be submitted, by post only, to:
Directorate: Non- Profit Organisations
Department Of Social Development
Private Bag X901, Pretoria, 0001
Or hand delivered to:
Directorate: Non-Profit Organisations
HSRC Building, 134 Pretorius Street, Pretoria, 0002
Your application for registration will take about two months to process.
However, on receipt of the application, an acknowledgement of receipt letter will be sent to you.
A registration certificate follows if the application is successful.
It is possible to appeal if your application is unsuccessful.

Women in need of protection can contact a shelter directly, or ask a social worker at the nearest district office of the Department, or your nearest police station for assistance in contacting a shelter.
Such women should also consider applying for a protection order.
Women who are being abused by persons addicted to drugs or alcohol may also consider applying to have their abuser committed to a drug treatment centre.
Should the abuser be known to have a licensed firearm, an application to have the firearm removed can also be considered.
Contact or go to a shelter directly, or ask for help on how to get to get to the nearest shelter at your nearest District Office or at your nearest police station.

Accommodation for the Aged
There are a number of state-funded homes for the aged in the Western Cape.
The provincial Department of Social Development can subsidise the board and lodging fees of people who are very frail and in need of assistance.
Anyone who can afford to pay the full board and lodging fees can also apply for accommodation in these homes.
To apply for accommodation at a home for the aged, you have to apply directly to the home itself, as every home as its own requirements and fee structure.
The Department of Social Development screens the applicants and will subsidise those who are very frail or disabled and who need assistance.
The final decision about admitting a person is made by the organisation that manages the home.
Those who do not need a subsidy for their board and lodging fees, can also apply directly to the home.
It is then up to the management of the home to decide whether to accept the person.

What are Family Group Conferences?
Family Group Conferences are one of the many restorative justice mechanisms used to reintegrate young offenders into society.
This short article explains in more detail what family group conferences are and how they work.
WHAT IS A FAMILY GROUP CONFERENCE?
The family group conference is a restorative justice mechanism by which families and communities are involved in making decisions about children who are accused of crimes.
The family group conference aims for negotiated solutions to conflict.
It is designed to heal the breach in social relationships caused by the crime.
The family group conference was pioneered in New Zealand in the 1980s during the reform of their juvenile justice system.
It is a form of restorative justice that was devised after consultation with the public, including Maoris and Pacific Islanders, throughout New Zealand.
The first step is that the child must acknowledge responsibility for his or her actions.
The family group conference itself is a meeting of all the people who are significant in the child's life, as well as the victim and the persons supportive of the victim.
The main goal of the conference is to formulate a plan about how best to put the wrong, right.
All the parties agree to the eventual outcome.
The parties might agree, for example, that the child should apologise, or replace what has been stolen.
Conferencing is perceived to be especially suited to young offenders, as it allows for early intervention in what may otherwise become a criminal career.
Children may also be more amenable and responsive to the process, which involves making them ashamed of their actions, as their personalities are still developing, and the process involves people close to them such as their parents and families.
Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom have all piloted some form of family group or community conferencing as diversion or sentencing options.
In South Africa, NICRO first began introducing the idea of diversion of children away from the criminal justice system in 1992, using the concepts of restorative justice.
In 1995 the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk set up a pilot family group conference in Pretoria.
Other South African pioneers of family group conferences are the Stepping Stones Project in Port Elizabeth, the Durban Assessment, Reception and Referral Centre, the North West Province Department of Social Services, Arts, Culture and Sport, and the Restorative Justice Centre.
The Child Justice Bill provides for family group conferences to be a restorative justice sentencing option.
In terms of the Bill a court may confirm, substitute or amend the recommendation arising from a family group conference.
If the court does not confirm the recommendation, it must note its reasons.
Should a child not comply with the recommendation as confirmed by the court, the probation officer must notify the court, and a warrant of arrest for the child may be issued.

The Department of Home Affairs has launched a new online marriage verification service as part of the Check Your Marital Status Campaign that was launched at the beginning of August.
The service has been made available to assist in preventing and uncovering instances where South Africans have been unknowingly married to foreigners.
The foreign spouses use the marriage to get residence and work permits in South Africa.
By 18 August 2004, the Campaign had uncovered 200 fraudulent marriages in South Africa.
The Department has promised to nullify resident permits, work permits and citizenship of people who have benefited from fraudulent marriages.
If you are a South African citizen, you can check your marital status by logging onto the Department of Home Affairs website and submitting your ID number.You can also visit your local Home Affairs office to check your status or contact the toll free number 0800 10 1994 during working hours (07:15 - 15:45).

Energy Saving Tips
20 November 2003
Department of Minerals and Energy (The Government of South Africa)
AUTHOR: Department of Minerals and Energy
This publication gives consumers tips on how to save electricity and energy.
TIP 1
Reduce the temperature of your geyser to around 55 degrees so that you don't need to add too much cold water when you shower or do the dishes.
TIP 2
Remember to keep the lid on the pot when you cook to conserve heat and energy.
The size of the pot should match the size of the stove plate - this can save you up to 25% on the electricity you use while cooking.
TIP 3
Close the windows and doors when the heater is on and save money!
TIP 4
Close the door every time you take things out of the fridge and also check that it seals properly.
TIP 5
Soak beans, samp and other related dry food over night.
This will save time, money and several hours of cooking.
TIP 6
Try to boil only the water you need instead of boiling a full pot or kettle every time.
TIP 7
Insulate your geyser by wrapping newspapers, old blankets or other insulating materials around it and the hot water pipes.
TIP 8
Switch off lights, fans, computers and other energy consuming appliances when you leave the room.
It will save you money.
TIP 9
Always try to use appropriate cooking utensils when cooking, for example use pots and pans with a flat bottom, they consume up to 50% less energy.
Note that electric stoves consumes a lot of electricity so use the plates and oven as little as possible.
TIP 10
Use the right energy for the right purposes, for example use heaters for space heating rather than hotplates, use an electrical kettle for water heating rather than an ordinary pot on the stove.
You will use about 50% less electricity.
Note: Electricity is good for electronic devices but gas is more efficient for heating and cooking.
TIP 11
Enjoy a comfortable indoor climate both summer and winter by ventilating your room properly on a daily basis.
Remember to switch off your heater, fan or air conditioner while ventilating the room.
TIP 12
Reduce your electricity account by skipping the washing machine's pre-wash cycle if your clothes are not particularly dirty.
This will use up to 20% less electricity.
TIP 13
TIP 14
Reduce the temperature on the heater from full heat to a comfortable level.
TIP 15
Turn off all stand-by modes every time you leave the house and before going to bed.
TIP 16
Use energy saving light bulbs.
They last much longer and use less electricity and this saves you money in the long run.
TIP 17
Reduce your electricity bill by doing all your ironing at the same time.
TIP 18
Check you electricity or gas meter at regular intervals and take a keen interest in your energy consumption level.
TIP 19
Share your energy consumption information with your neighbours - discuss your electricity bills!
FUEL SAVING TIPS
* When possible establish lift clubs.
* Switch to radial-ply tyres because they offer less rolling resistance and have a longer life than the cross-ply variety.
* Avoid driving with under inflated tyres because a tyre pressure that is too low not only increases consumption, it also markedly reduces a tyre's life.
* Avoid stop-start driving
* Accelerate slowly
* Do not speed.
The faster you drive the more petrol you use.

Information about Road Safety
The Arrive Alive Campaign aims to decrease the number of lives lost on South African roads through raising public awareness of road safety concerns.
The Arrive Alive campaign was launched in 2001.
Since then road deaths have decreased by an average of 7.4%.
At least 270 lives have been saved each year since the start of Arrive Alive.
This translates to a saving to the economy of over R450 million.
The Campaign uses educational materials and road accident statistics to raise public awareness around the dangers of road accidents.
You can call the National Arrive Alive Information Centre at 0800 005 619 or fax them at 0800 111 301.
You can also visit the Arrive Alive website for extensive information on road safety.
You can also get information on road safety from the provincial Department of Community Safety.

MUNICIPAL ROADS
The Municipality handles applications to film on municipal streets, roads, sidewalks and road verges.
The production company must ensure that normal pedestrian and vehicle access is maintained at all times other than when filming actually takes place, unless dedicated use of a specific area has been specified in the permit.
If a road is to be closed, an alternate route must be available.
Details of how to apply for a permit are set out in the Draft policy document on Commercial Film and Photographic Location.
For more information contact the Cape Film Commission:
Applications to use a provincial road for filming purposes need to be made to the Department of Transport and Public Works' Law Administration Division not later than two weeks in advance of any filming.

ISISHWANKATHELO
* Cash flow procedures and processes developed by us are viewed by the National Treasury as the norm for effective provincial cashflow management.
These procedures and processes result in the maximum amount of interest and make up most of the financing behind iKapa elihlumayo.
* The Western Cape was the first Province to do its own assessments of actual budgets submitted by departments to see whether these budgets made sense and whether they supported the principles of iKapa elihlumayo.
* Everyone concerned has accepted the Employment Equity Plan (EEP).
This plan sets out how the Treasury will diversify its workforce to reflect the demographics of the Western Cape.
It also sets out how unfair discrimination will be eliminated in the workplace.
* In 2002, the Treasury developed the first full Workplace Skills Plan (WSP) together with a comprehensive skills audit which was submitted to the relevant Sector Education Training Authority (SETA).
* The Provincial Treasury in the Western Cape and Polokwane in the Northern Province were identified as pilot sites for the implementation of a learnership in public sector accounting which was launched on 2 April 2003 provincially and 20 June 2003 nationally.
These are the first Public Service institutions that host this kind of training.
* The WC Treasury was the first institution to get full accreditation as a Workplace Training Institution: No other private or public institution in the country has yet been granted full accreditation.
This was also a first for the Finance and Accounting Services SETA (FASSET).
* Through FASSET, our internal training manuals were redesigned as reference material and course material was developed in an outcome-based modular format to meet the accreditation requirements of SAQA (South African Qualification Authority) and the NQF (National Qualification Framework).
* In addition to learnerships, there have been a record number of bursaries awarded to Treasury personnel on our first endeavour towards becoming a learning organization.
* There is an increasing focus on boosting own provincial revenue sources.
This has resulted in a steady growth in our revenue over the last four years, grossing over one Billion Rand in 2003/04.
Other income generation initiatives are being investigated, like the imposition of a fuel levy and a tourism bed levy.
* With the 2003 Western Cape Gambling and Racing Amendment Acts 2003, a major black economic empowerment deal was made possible within the casino industry.
* We have started the process of formulating fiscal policy, which provides guidelines of how provincial resources should be allocated in the budget and allows for more public transparency in the budget process.
* Western Cape Revenue and Expenditure Policy Framework 2000/01 - 2002/03
* Western Cape Fiscal Policy 2001 - 2004, 2002 - 2005 and 2003 - 2006
* Western Cape Medium Term Budget Policy Statement 2004 - 2007
* A Western Cape Provincial Preferential Procurement Policy (2000) has been developed and implemented, which will help in the sustainable development and implementation of a preferential procurement system.
* An Electronic Purchasing System (Sourcelink) has been instituted, which brought about a faster response and turn-around time for smaller tenders.
* A Suppliers database (2003) has been developed in collaboration with the City of Cape Town.
This accredits suppliers and lists their HDI (historically disadvantaged individuals) status.
* A procurement Website (2003) was established containing all the relevant information needed by people wanting to tender for provincial government contracts.
* A 100% conversion process from cheques to Electronic Fund Transfers was put in place, which is more cost effective.
* Due to outdated and insufficient systems that existed for the management and control of consumables and movable assets, the Logistical Information System (LOGIS) was rolled out to 41 provincial sites (mainly at Health) managing stock levels in excess of R1,3 billion.

BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT: OVERVIEW
* What is BEE?
* What is the Black Economic Empowerment Sub-directorate?
* What are the aims of this unit?
* What services does the BEE unit offer?
* BEE Terminology
WHAT IS BEE?
BEE is the broad approach to de-racialise South Africa's economy and to fast track the entry of Historically Disadvantaged Individuals (HDIs) into the business arena.
BEE is an inclusive process that needs all sectors of the economy's input to make it work.
Government is trying to create real BEE and avoid the situation of 'fronting' which many companies still apply.
Each industry sector is responsible for a Charter which describes the environment as it currently is and the environment required for fulfilling Broad Based Economic Empowerment.
The Mining, Finance and Oil Industries have finalised their BEE Charters.
Other industries, such as the Wine, Tourism and ICT sectors have produced Draft Charters.
BEE is associated with good governance and forms part of an overall growth strategy for all these sectors as well as aiming to create equitable market activity.
WHAT IS THE BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT SUB-DIRECTORATE?
This sub-directorate is responsible for planning and implementing the principles of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (passed on 9 January 2004) in the Western Cape.
This Act is the accepted framework for economic empowerment for both business and government.
While the Act encourages companies to implement BEE, it has currently no specific penalties or specific deadlines.
Many companies are on board, but government still perceives the pace of change to be too slow.
The BEE sub-directorate offers assistance to white businesses to adjust their BEE profile in line with the Act's requirements and guides and facilitates the needs of black businesses allowing them to develop and grow.
The unit also aims to:
* Increase the number of black people who control enterprises.
* Facilitate the ownership and management of enterprises and productive assets by communities, co-operatives and other collective enterprises.
* Develop human resources and skills in previously disadvantaged communities.
* Achieve equitable representation at senior and executive levels of organizations.
* Ensure that Preferential Procurement procedures set up by Government are carried out.
* Promote investment in enterprises owned or managed by black people.
* Promote all aspects of women's empowerment (equity, ownership, gender equality).
* Develop means for disabled people to be more active in the economy.
* Create and protect employment.
* Create and nurture Youth Empowerment (for example, through learnerships).
The unit provides various services including:
* providing ongoing marketing on the role of the unit to relevant people
* providing start-to-finish facilitation and advice service to black businesses
* providing an advice service to predominantly white companies on how to integrate BEE into their organisations in a responsible manner
* referring businesses for finance to the National Empowerment Fund, the Independent Development Corporation and banks through Khula
* facilitating BEE deals on a provincial level and working with the dti on a national level where relevant
* providing ongoing resource information on BEE
* working with established business organisations across the board (for example the Western Cape Business Opportunities Forum, The Cape Chamber of Commerce and NAFCOC).
BEE TERMINOLOGY
* BEE - Black Economic Empowerment.
* HDI - Historically disadvantaged individuals, also called previously disadvantaged individuals.
* Previously Disadvantaged - People who did not have equal opportunities in the past, including black people, women and disabled people.
* Good Governance - Accountable, transparent, professional management and leadership.
* BEE Charter - Sectoral BEE policy in terms of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 2003 setting out the current situation in the sector and what transformation is required.
* Fronting - Tokenism, superficial inclusion of historically disadvantaged individuals.
* Preferential Procurement - Policy requiring government entities to source products and services from enterprises that match the preferential factors set out in the policy, for example entities that are owned or part-owned by previously disadvantaged individuals.

Some of the most common chronic illnesses are asthma and high blood pressure (hypertension).
* Hypertension: prevention, treatment and management
WHAT ARE CHRONIC DISEASES?
Chronic illnesses may be inherited, but many lifestyle and environmental factors such as smoking, inappropriate diet, lack of exercise and heavy alcohol consumption are known to significantly increase risks.
These factors are to some extent within the control of a well-informed individual, but there are often other factors such as poverty, under-nutrition during pregnancy and in infancy, genetic predisposition and ageing, over which the individual has little or no control.
Besides early diagnosis, management and harm reduction, a very important aspect of the service is aimed at prevention of illness and promotion of healthy behaviour.
Priority chronic diseases are: high blood pressure or hypertension, asthma, epilepsy, stroke, renal disease, cancer, obstructive lung disease and Diabetes Type 2. (Diabetes Type 1, which is mostly diagnosed in early childhood, is less common.)
Most of these illnesses are long-term and while many cannot be cured, they can be controlled.
While people of all ages are affected by chronic illnesses, there is a higher risk of the elderly developing chronic diseases, this in turn can result in disability.
PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT AT PRIMARY HEALTH CARE LEVEL
At primary health care level the service is based on prevention by educating people about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.
Every clinic has a staff member who has the skills to diagnose and manage chronic conditions from young to elderly clients.
Patients are able to see the same nurse for repeat visits if they come regularly on the diabetes/ hypertension or asthma clinic day.
They are given a special card or sticker on their folder and this is used to ensure continuity of care.
Counselling and compliance are also part of the service.
Doctors/medical officers undertake periodic visits from hospitals to clinics to review chronic disease patients.
Arrangements are made by the clinic to minimise patient travel (especially by the elderly) by prescribing supplies of drugs to last one to three months.
Staff often facilitate the initiation of clubs and special support groups for people with chronic diseases.
In this way a patient can get more information on special care and health education pertaining to their condition.
If complications arise, patients will be referred to the next level of care.
Some examples of how chronic illnesses are prevented, managed and treated are given below.
Asthma affects adults and children.
It is a chronic inflammation of the airways caused by an allergy.
Asthma cannot be cured, but can be effectively managed by taking preventive medication on a daily basis.
Assessment and treatment of adults is done at primary health care clinics where clients are examined, special tests are carried out and treatment is initiated.
Clients are educated about how to manage their asthma and informed about aggravating factors including smoking, lack of exercise and house dust mites.
Clients who have severe asthma attacks may require emergency treatment and referral to a hospital.
Hypertension or high blood pressure is a disease of lifestyle that can be prevented and treated.
If the blood pressure remains high for a period, serious complications can develop.
These can involve the blood vessels, the heart, the kidneys and the eyes.
The result could be stroke, heart disease or kidney failure and even death.
At primary health care level, clients with high blood pressure will be informed about how to improve general health and reduce other risk factors for heart disease e.g. exercise, giving up smoking, alcohol and drugs and cutting down on salt intake.
If after this the blood pressure remains high, treatment will be prescribed.
Clients must return to the clinic for regular check-ups and medication.
Serious complications like stroke, heart disease and kidney failure have to be treated at hospital level.
Chronic care services at all three levels - primary, secondary and tertiary - facilitate getting social service grants to people who need them.
These services are available at all clinics and hospitals throughout the Western Cape.
First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.
Bring your ID book.
A referral letter from the clinic will be required when visiting a hospital.
Hospitals ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).
Bring your hospital card if previously registered at the hospital.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Chronic Illness > Eye Care/Prevention of Blindness Programme
This service aims to prevent eye conditions that could lead to blindness, and to treat people who have problems with their eyesight.
Eye tests, which include using eye charts, are available at Primary Health Care Clinic (PHC level, and help to check for refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness, distorted vision and "ageing eyes".
If you need spectacles, your name will be placed on a waiting list for between one to 18 months.
The PHC nurse will make an appointment for you with an optometrist who visits the clinic on a sessional basis.
Free spectacle and other assistive devices have become a reality and will be implemented shortly.
Cataracts, a degenerative thickening/opaqueness of the lens, are the leading cause of blindness.
They are treatable and can be identified easily at PHC clinics and centres, as well as by home-based carers because they are so noticeable.
Operations to remove cataracts are performed at secondary level hospitals.
There is a waiting list.
Diabetics should have an annual eye test to check for the early formation of cataracts.
There can also be a change in the retina, which can lead to blindness.
In this case the client would need to be referred to a secondary level hospital, where they will be given laser therapy.
Primary prevention includes health education, immunisation against measles in children, maternal and health services, and safety promotion.
Prevention of corneal scarring from malnutrition, infection and injury /trauma is important.
The lack of Vitamin A is a major cause of blindness in children.
Chronic glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in South Africa.
Ophthalmic nurses and optometrists examine clients at hospitals (district or secondary level).
If surgery is required, the patient will be referred to a tertiary hospital.
Other useful contacts:
* Bureau for the Prevention of Blindness: tel 012 452 3811 or write to PO Box 11149, Hatfield, 0028 Pretoria
* SA Optometric Association: tel 011 805 4517 or email pro@saoa.co.za
Basic eye examinations are available at all PHC clinics and centres.
If necessary, clients will be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.First-time visitors to the clinic or secondary/tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.
Hospitals will ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).
Free at PHC level.
If you are referred to a hospital, there is a cost involved.
The amount will depend on how much you earn and on how many dependents you have, according to the hospital rating scale.
THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA - SERVICES: EMERGENCY SERVICES
Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Emergency Services > Medical Emergency Transport and Rescue
These emergency services provide on-the-spot assistance for patients and transport the patient to hospital.
Services in the Western Cape are offered by:
* METRO Services
* Red Cross Air Mercy Service
* First aid organisations
METRO SERVICES
METRO provides a 24-hour emergency medical response for the rescue and transportation of the sick and injured to the nearest appropriate healthcare facility.
The Western Cape has a fleet of around 400 vehicles, including rescue vehicles, rapid response vehicles, patient transporters and ambulances.
Each ambulance has two people trained to provide emergency medical care.
The level of care provided is determined by the qualifications of the crew, which include basic life support, intermediate life support and advanced life support (paramedics).
Specialist rescue qualifications equip the staff with the knowledge and skills needed to sort out complex medical rescue situations.
The Health Professions Council of South Africa determines education and training standards for Emergency Care Personnel and requires that they be registered before being able to practise.
The medical emergency care response and the time taken to transport patients to hospitals depend on the complexity of the medical problem and the distance of the incident from the nearest facility.
People calling for assistance must provide the following essential information:
* the exact location of the incident, injury or illness
* the nature of the medical problem or rescue situation
* a call back number.
For an efficient service to continue, patient's rights must be balanced with patient's responsibility and people are asked to use ambulance services only when there is a real emergency.
RED CROSS AIR MERCY SERVICE
The Red Cross Air Mercy Service is used to transport sick people over long distances by air to Cape Town's three tertiary hospitals.
The service cannot be used directly by members of the public and can only be accessed by public health professionals.
FIRST AID ORGANISATIONS
First Aid organisations including St John Ambulance, SA Red Cross Society Western Cape and SA First Aid League give back-up assistance to Metro services and give first aid at sporting and cultural events.
Volunteers are an important part of the service and there are volunteer groups in towns throughout the Western Cape.
These groups can be contacted through the ambulance services in all four regions (see numbers below).
If you want to be a volunteer contact the Pinelands Division of the service on 021 511 5154 and ask for the co-ordinator of the volunteer groups.
Usually you will be interviewed and then once you have joined as a volunteer you will be taken out on ambulance calls.
You will be required to attend Level I, 2, and 3 first aid courses given by paramedics.
In addition, you may be sent for short courses at the Academy of Emergency Medical Care at the Cape Technikon.
The courses involve basic, intermediate and advanced life support.
These are some other useful contacts:
* St John Ambulance: tel 021 461 8420, a/h emergency tel 021 423 3333
* SA Red Cross Society Western Cape: tel 021 797 5360, email redxcape@iafrica.com
* SA First Aid League: tel 021 948 6294.

The Primary Health Care (PHC) service detects, diagnoses and treats common mental health conditions, and organises the referral of more complicated mental health problems to more appropriate levels of mental health care.
If you are suffering from a mental health condition, you can go to your local clinic where a health worker will assess you and offer initial treatment.
In the Metro, Southern Cape Karoo and West Coast Winelands regions, the health worker may refer you onto more specialised care offered by a mental health (psychiatric) nurse, where available.
An appointment would need to be made to see the mental health nurse at the clinic as the nurse visits several clinics in a week.
The mental health nurse may further assess your mental health condition to enable them to provide the most effective treatment.
Treatment may include medication as well as short-term individual or group counselling and support.
The mental health nurse may consult with the regional psychologist or psychiatrist (or other members of the regional mental health team) when additional expertise is required.
If necessary, the mental health nurse may set up an appointment with one of these specialists for further assessment at the PHC clinic.
Additional support besides clinic visits may be necessary to promote and maintain good mental health, and clients may be advised to attend psychosocial rehabilitation support groups where necessary and available.
Consult the mental health directory or ask your local clinic or mental health nurse about groups in your area.
The Department of Health also gives partial subsidies to NGOs in some regions who offer group homes for adults with mental illness and day care centres for children under 18 years of age with profound and severe intellectual disability.
Enquiries about vacancies at these NGO-run facilities would need to be directed to the NGO concerned. (See mental health directory)

Mental Health Hospital Services
In- and out-patient mental health services are available for children and adults during those periods when their mental health care needs require more intensive and contained care than available at the primary level of care.
Hospital care for mental health is currently primarily offered in units located in the metropolitan region, however these centres offer services for clients throughout the province according to designated areas.
The following four psychiatric hospitals offer specialised in- and outpatient care for adults:
* Valkenberg and Stikland Hospitals mainly provide a service for general psychiatric illnesses.
* Lentegeur Hospital offers services for people with mental illness or intellectual disability.
* Alexandra Hospital has services for people with intellectual disability only.
Provincial services for children are available at the following units:
* The Red Cross Child and Family Unit, Rondebosch, Cape Town offers an outpatient service for children with mental health difficulties.
There is also a specialist in-patient service for children under 12.
For more information call 021 685 4103.
* William Slater in Rondebosch, Cape Town has day and out-patient services for adolescents (13-18 years) with mental health problems.
Call 021 685 5116 for details.
* Tygerberg Child and Family Unit offers in- and out-patient care for children and adolescents.
Call 021 938 4573 for more information.
Specialised in- and out-patient services for selected mental health disorders are also available at the University of Cape Town's Psychiatry Department, at Groote Schuur Hospital, Stellenbosch University's Psychiatric Department, and from Tygerberg Hospital.
For information on access to hospital services for adults and children living in the other regions contact:
* Boland: Call 023 348 1401 or fax 023 342 850.
* Overberg: Call 023 348 1400 or fax 023 347 5211.
* Southern Cape/ Karoo: Call 044 802 4537 or fax 044 874 5017.
* A short-stay psychiatric inpatient service is offered from George Hospital in the Southern Cape Karoo.
* West Coast/Winelands: Call 022 487 9264 or fax 022 487 2927.
Potential clients must be referred to these hospitals by primary mental health services or secondary (regional) hospitals.
The hospital should be contacted by the referring health worker to arrange admission beforehand.
Specialised mental health services based at tertiary hospitals, Red Cross, Groote Schuur or Tygerberg would require a referral letter or completed admission application obtainable at the service centre, before the service can be accessed by appointment.
First-time referrals to psychiatric or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.
Most clients voluntarily admit themselves for hospital treatment.
In terms of the current Mental Health Act, when the client has a psychiatric crisis and is not willing to come or unable to assess their own need to have hospital treatment, and presents a risk for their own or other safety, it may be necessary for family members to have the person committed to hospital.
In this case, family members should lodge an application for assistance in obtaining involuntary care with the local magistrate in their district.
Mental health legislation is currently under review and changes will be introduced to the process for admitting a person for involuntary care when the new Mental Health Care Act and regulations are formally promulgated into law.
On discharge from hospital, a follow-up appointment can be arranged with the mental health nurse at the clinic-based service closest to the client's home, to ensure continuity of care.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Mental > Help with Substance Abuse
Community-based, primary and hospital-level mental health services for children, adolescents and adults with substance abuse problems are available.
Clients with substance abuse problems can access treatment from primary mental health clinics.
Outpatient detoxification may be offered at primary level, if necessary.
Clients who are dependent on substances may, depending on the substance and other factors, experience mild to severe withdrawal symptoms when they stop using these substances.
Detoxification is a medical intervention which helps in minimising the physical and psychological impact, and managing possible medical risks of withdrawal from the substance, before the client goes for further treatment and rehabilitation
When a client's substance abuse problem requires more intensive services, the following services are available:
Regional Hospitals (secondary level) offer detoxification services for people with alcohol and drug dependency prior to admission to the abuse treatment centres for further treatment and rehabilitation.
De Nova Treatment Centre in Kraaifontein is fully subsidised by the provincial Department of Social Development and provides in-patient treatment for alcohol and drug dependency.
The service is for indigent clients and for those who have been referred by the criminal justice system.
Psychiatric and psychological services are given on a sessional basis by mental health professionals employed by the Department of Health.
Some NGO-run substance abuse treatment centres are registered and partly subsidised by the provincial Department of Social Development.
A few private substance abuse treatment centres are licensed by the Department of Health to offer substance abuse treatment programmes inclusive of detoxification services programmes.
Stikland Hospital also provides in-patient services for alcohol rehabilitation.
* Interventions for Youth at Risk (Service)
Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Treatment for Sexual Abuse/Rape
At the clinic, the survivor will be interviewed and counselled by a health worker in a private room/area.
The health worker will ask whether the rape has been reported to the police.
If, and only if, the survivor wants to report the rape, a police officer will be asked to come to the health facility to get a statement.
Women may also get emergency contraception if they arrive at the clinic within 72 hours of being raped.
If the survivors arrive within 72 hours of being raped, they will be offered the anti-Aids drug AZT (Zidovudine).
Survivors who arrive after 72 hours should be counselled about the possible risk of getting HIV and be given a follow-up appointment date for six weeks and three months post rape for HIV testing and counselling.
Rape survivors will be given the option of going for counselling to a social worker/ trained counsellor/private therapist (e.g. psychologist) /Rape Crisis or other NGO.
Report to your nearest health care facility and state that you have been raped and/or assaulted.
At the 52 centres which have specially dedicated services for women and men who have been sexually assaulted and/or raped.
These special clinics which mostly operate 24hours a day are listed in the provincial Department of Health's policy and management guidelines for survivors of rape and sexual assault.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Contraception (Family Planning)
The service offers counselling on and provision of a range of safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods from which women, men and teenagers can freely choose to prevent unwanted pregnancy.
* Information and Counselling
* Methods of Contraception
* Useful Contacts.
INFORMATION AND COUNSELLING
Information on the various contraceptive methods is given to help individuals make informed choices based on their personal history and physical examination.
If a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) is detected, it will be treated with medication at the clinic or a referral letter may be given to a special clinic.
Once a contraceptive method has been chosen, the client is monitored for possible side effects in follow up visits to the clinic.
Any girl or woman can decide if she wants to use contraception.
She does not need the permission of her partner or parents.
Many clinics now have a dedicated youth service so that young people can get information about family planning in a comfortable environment.
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Oral contraception for women: Pills come in packets of 28 and must be taken once daily at the same time.
There are two main types: Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) pills and Progestogen-only Contraceptive (POP) pills.
They are free of charge at clinics and hospitals and can also be bought at pharmacies without prescription.
This form of contraception does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).
Contraceptive injection for women: There are two types: Nur-Isterate, which is given every two months (8 weeks) and DMPA (Depo Provera or Petogen ) which is given every three months (12 weeks).
Intrauterine device (IUD): An IUD is a small device that is put into a women's uterus (womb) by a specially trained health worker.
An IUD can prevent pregnancy for at least five years.
It does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).
If a women or her partner has multiple sex partners, the IUD should not be the method of first choice unless condoms are also used, to protect against STI/HIV transmission.
Women are required to go to the clinic for a check up six weeks after the IUD has been inserted.
It is also advisable to go for a check-up every year.
The IUD is available at some clinics only but can also be bought at pharmacies.
Emergency contraception: This method can be used by women who want to prevent pregnancy because they have had unprotected sex, been raped or they suspect that the contraception they used during sexual intercourse did not work properly.
Emergency contraceptive pills can be taken 72 hours (three days) after unprotected sex to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but the earlier the pills are taken the better they work.
Pills are free of charge at clinics and hospitals and can also be bought without prescription at pharmacies
An IUD can also be inserted within five days of unprotected sex to prevent unwanted pregnancy.
If it is too late for these emergency contraceptive methods, and an unwanted pregnancy is suspected, a Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) is available as a last resort.
TOP is legal in South Africa.
Condoms: Female and male condoms are the only single method that offer dual protection from both unwanted pregnancy as well as Sexually Transmitted Infections including HIV/Aids.
Male condoms are free of charge at clinics and some public venues.
Condoms are also sold cheaply at most pharmacies and shops.
Female condoms are available free of charge at a few designated clinics and for sale in some pharmacies.
Sterilisation: This is a permanent contraceptive method for both women and men.
Any person 18 years or above who is capable of consenting may be sterilised at his or her request.
Counselling should be given before the procedure.
It is a short and simple operation that does not affect one's sex life, other than giving peace of mind about unwanted.
A booking for sterilisation can be made at the local clinic.
Counselling is provided and a request form will need to be signed.
The operation is free of charge at some community health centres and hospitals at every level (primary, secondary and tertiary).
The doctor who does the operation will ask the client to sign a consent form.
The operation for females is called a tubal ligation.
The fallopian tubes that carry the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (womb) are tied or blocked.
The eggs are prevented from becoming fertilised by the sperm and pregnancy is prevented.
The procedure for males is called a vasectomy, which is usually done while the man is awake, using local anaesthetic, or a general anaesthetic.
One or two very small openings are made in the skin near the testicles.
The vas deferens (sperm tube), which carries sperm from each testicle, are cut and tied.
The operation is not immediately effective and another contraception method is needed for three months after the operation, or for the next 15-20 times that the man has sex.
A confirmatory test (sperm count) is necessary to ensure that the sperm is cleared from the tubes.
Sterilisation does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).
As with all contraceptive methods, there is a small risk of failure.
Mentally disabled people can be sterilised in terms of the Sterilisation Act, 1998 (Act No. 44 of 1998).
The parent, guardian, curator or spouse can request the sterilisation of a person who is incapable of consenting due to mental disability.
An application must be made and sent to the relevant hospital.
An appointment will be made for a panel consisting of three mental health professionals to assess the client, who must be accompanied by the applicant.
Depending on the circumstances, the panel will decide on whether or not to proceed with sterilisation.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Cervical Cancer Screening
Cervical and breast cancer are the two most common forms of cancer found amongst South African women and all women are at risk of developing these cancers.
Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer.
All women should have a pap smear at least every 10 years starting at age 30 years.
This means at around 30, 40 and 50 years of age.
The screening programme aims at finding and treating early signs of cancer of the cervix, commonly known as the "mouth of the womb".
The screening involves taking a pap (or cervical) smear, which is a simple, quick vaginal examination to check if the cervix is healthy.
Some cells are gently wiped off the cervix and sent to the laboratory for testing.
Sometimes, results are unclear and a repeat smear is necessary.
Women who have had the test must go back to the clinic to get the laboratory results.
Remember, the client is entitled to ask for an explanation of the procedure beforehand.
Cervical cancer can be prevented by avoiding multiple sex partners, using condoms to prevent the spread of human papillomavirus (which has been linked to cervical cancer), postponing first sexual intercourse until older, and not smoking cigarettes.
Go to your local primary health care clinic.
If a pap smear result is abnormal, a booking will be made and a referral letter given for further testing and treatment at a secondary or tertiary level hospital.
Bring your ID book, referral letter (if relevant), any medication you are taking and your clinic/hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.
A woman can get three free screening pap smears in her lifetime, one every 10 years starting at age 30.
* Cervical Cancer Fact Sheet for Health Workers (Public Information)

Breast self-examination education is given at clinics.
Bring your ID book, your clinic/hospital card if previously registered at facility and the referral letter from the clinic if you have been referred to a breast cancer clinic at a hospital.
Services at primary health care facilities are free for people who are not on medical aid.
If you are referred to a hospital, there may be a cost involved.

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Infertility Programme
Depending on the results, fertility treatment is either given or advised against.
There is no service for infertility at primary health care level but the tertiary hospitals Tygerberg and Groote Schuur offer extensive investigations and treatment.A referral is necessary to a tertiary hospital where various fertility treatments are offered.
If you are a first-time visitor you will have to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Take your ID book and hospital card if previously registered at the hospital.
There is a cost involved.
The amount will depend on the couple's income and number of dependents they have, according to the hospital rating scale.
Those taking part in the programme have to pay for the treatment which can cost anything from between R150 and R6,600.
The hospital will require a recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).

Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Male Reproductive Health
Reproductive health is the shared responsibility of a couple.
Therefore, men play an important role and should take their fair share of responsibility for contraception and for using condoms to prevent both unwanted pregnancies and the spread of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including HIV/Aids.
Men and women should consult with their partners regarding the choice of contraception and negotiate a mutually acceptable method, and who should be the primary user.
For example, a vasectomy is a very minor procedure for a man to undergo.
Male circumcision
With widespread reports of young men dying as a result of unsafe circumcisions, young men can have free medical check-ups at primary health care clinics to ensure that they are in good health before going to traditional initiation schools.
Safe, hygienic circumcisions can be done at primary health care facilities.
The procedure can be performed on male infants shortly after birth at various health care facilities.
You should go to your local primary health care clinic.
First -time visitors to primary health care facilities/hospitals will have to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Bring ID book and clinic/hospital card if previously registered at the facility.
The amount will depend on your earnings and number of dependents, according to the hospital rating scale.

WHAT IS TB?
TB is a bacterial disease, and is a serious problem in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape.
TB is highly infectious but curable.
One out of ten people develop the disease.
If not treated, the infectious person can affect 20 other people or more in a year.
TB spreads when infected people with pulmonary (lung) TB cough tiny droplets containing TB into the air, and others breathe them in.
People who have TB of other parts of the body are not infectious.
A persistent cough of two weeks or more is the main sign of TB, so the earlier the client goes to the clinic to get examined, the easier it is to cure.
More severe signs are coughing up of blood, nightsweats, loss of weight, and shortness of breath.
DIAGNOSING TB
The client is examined at a primary health care clinic and asked to give a sputum sample and another the next day.
These samples are sent to a laboratory and the results are available in 48 hours.
Only one of them needs to be positive to indicate TB infection.
If the result is positive, the client will be counselled and advised on the benefits of being put on the TB control programme.
If both sputum samples are positive, treatment is given immediately.
An x-ray may also be taken, but the sputum tests confirm diagnosis.
If the TB infection is severe, the client will be referred to a specialist TB clinic.
TB TREATMENT
TB can only be cured if the full course of treatment, which can be from six to eight months, is completed.
People who stop treatment are likely to develop multi-drug resistance, making the TB more difficult to cure.
These cases are treated at TB specialist clinics e.g. Brooklyn Chest Hospital.
TB can be fatal if not treated.
Treatment is in two phases:
The intensive phase is when four different drugs in tablet form are given for five days a week, for two to three months.
The second phase is the continuation phase, in which two drugs are given for five days a week, for four to five months.
First-time TB clients must be treated for six months, while clients who have had TB before must take TB medicine for eight months.
If there are side effects from the medication, the client must return to the clinic.
Sputum tests are taken again after two months on treatment to check for progress, and at five or seven months to confirm whether the client is cured.
Children with TB are given different medicines and treated for four months only.
To try and prevent TB, babies should be immunised with the BCG vaccine, which is available free of charge at all primary health care clinics.
TB meningitis is a serious illness in children and can be fatal.
If suspected (symptoms include neck stiffness) the child must be taken to the clinic immediately.
DOTS
The Department of Health has adopted the World Health Organisation's DOTS (directly observed treatment short course) method to ensure patients adhere to treatment.
DOTS has been implemented in most clinics in the Western Cape.
An important element of the strategy is the support and encouragement offered to TB clients for the entire six- to eight-month treatment period, where clients are directly observed taking their medication at the clinic.
At community level, DOTS is undertaken by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using volunteers as "treatment supporters".
TB NGOs recruit, train and supervise members of communities to function as treatment supporters for TB clients.
Supporters refer TB clients to the clinic when necessary.
The Cape Technikon offers training for people who want to be TB supporters.
Phone 021 460 3197 for further information.
TB Care Association, Santa Cape Town and Santa Western Cape are the three NGOs that deliver community-based treatment to TB patients in the province.
The provincial government provides financial assistance and support to these NGOs.
TB AND HIV
The HIV epidemic has led to an enormous increase in the number of TB cases.
TB, an opportunistic infection, is responsible for a third of all deaths in HIV-infected people.
People with HIV are far more susceptible to TB infection, and are less able to fight it off.
The Department of Health is in the process of adopting an integrated TB and HIV/Aids strategy.
Currently voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is offered to TB clients with the aim of reducing early death and illness.
Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (drugs to treat pneumonia) is given for dually infected individuals.

RED CROSS WAR MEMORIAL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: A NATIONAL ASSET
In 1956 the hospital opened its doors as a dedicated and highly specialised children's healthcare facility.
It is a living memorial for soldiers who died in WWII.
From all nine provinces and from all over Africa, children are referred to the institution to receive comprehensive specialist paediatric services.
It is a referral hospital - patients are referred from clinics and smaller hospitals - before being admitted to the tertiary institution.
The hospital is active in paediatric outreach and support programmes across South Africa.
A CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE
It is a centre of excellence for the training of all categories of child health professionals.
Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital is regarded as South Africa's leading centre for post-graduate specialist paediatric medical and surgical training.
The Hospital has a staff complement of 1100, ranging from academics, doctors and nurses to professions allied to medicine, clerical and non-professional staff.
Local undergraduates and post-graduate students from around the world receive training and experience in the wards and clinics.
The hospital has academic links to the University of Cape Town's School of Child and Adolescent Health, the University of the Western Cape Dental School and the University of Stellenbosch.

Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Health > Secondary, Tertiary and Emergency Care > Tygerberg and Dental Hospitals > Services > Health > Oral & Dental > Dental/Oral Health
The State provides dental and oral health services to the public that aim to promote oral health, prevent tooth decay and treat any problems.
* What dental services are offered?
* Gum disease
* Oral thrush
* Anaesthetics
* Jaw fractures
* Who can get subsidised dental services?
* Promotion and prevention
WHAT DENTAL SERVICES ARE OFFERED?
At the most basic level of care (primary health care clinics) the dental/oral health service has three parts: promotion, prevention and treatment.
In some areas of the province (e.g. Mossel Bay) the same basic service is available at the local hospital.
Oral health professionals at clinic level promote oral health by educating people on how to keep their mouths, gums and teeth in good health and by showing people how to prevent tooth decay and other oral problems.
The basic treatment services available are oral examinations, X-rays, scaling and polishing of teeth in order to remove plaque and prevent gum disease, fillings and emergency relief of pain and sepsis including dental extractions.
Crowns and bridges are sometimes available but are low priorities.
GUM DISEASE
A patient can be treated for severe gum disease (periodontitis) at a clinic.
However, if there is oral pathology - lesions or ulcers in the soft mouth tissue often caused by excessive smoking, drinking or due to HIV infection - and the patient is in danger of getting cancer, then they will be referred to a tertiary level hospital.
ORAL THRUSH
People who are HIV positive and those that have Aids often suffer from oral thrush.
These are open sores or lesions in the mouth.
Diflucan, a drug, which treats oral thrush, is available free of charge at primary health care clinics.
ANAESTHETICS
Patients can be given a local anaesthetic for dental and oral problems at primary health care clinics.
If a general anaesthetic is needed, the dentist will book the patient in at a local hospital theatre and the dentist will perform the procedure at the hospital.
The Hope Street Clinic in Cape Town is the only clinic where general anaesthetic is available.
JAW FRACTURES
Fractures of the upper jaw (often as a result of domestic violence or car accidents) will be referred to the secondary or tertiary hospitals.
Simple lower jaw fractures can be seen at the primary health care facilities.
The more complicated cases will be referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals.
WHO CAN GET SUBSIDISED DENTAL SERVICES?
The provincial government subsidises a denture service for indigent adults, those receiving old age pensions and those who have been institutionalised.
There is a fee involved to cover laboratory costs.
People with orthodontic problems can be seen at primary health care facilities but will be referred to dental schools at the University of the Western Cape and Tygerberg Hospital.
Children who need to have braces put onto their teeth or removed will need to be referred to these dental schools.
In urban clinics the oral health team is made up of a dentist, a dental assistant and an oral hygienist.
The situation is different in rural areas that are visited by a dental team with mobile equipment.
The equipment can be set up as an emergency service, usually at schools.
PROMOTION AND PREVENTION
The promotion and prevention programme includes visits by health workers to some crèches and some primary schools.
Oral and dental information and education is also given to pregnant women as part of the antenatal service.
Primary school children are taught about the need to prevent the build up of plaque and how to remove it through correct brushing and flossing of teeth.
Toothbrushes and toothpaste are provided.
They are also given a mouth rinse containing fluoride as part of the Fluoride Supplementation Programme.
Fluoride strengthens teeth and helps prevent tooth decay.
The children are educated about nutrition and the need for healthy eating habits to prevent the build up of plaque and tooth decay.
Cape Town is the only city that is fluoridating its water supplies according to the Regulations under the Health Act, 1977 (Act 63 of 1977).)
The Minister of Health and the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry have jointly approved the regulations.
The service is available at all primary health care clinics or centres.
Patients with complicated problems will be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for you.
A referral letter from the clinic is required when visiting a hospital.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY
Although the running of Old Age homes (OAH) for the Aged / elderly is a function of the provincial Department of Social Development, the Department of Health is indirectly / directly involved in the health needs of the aged.
Elderly patients, including those with chronic illnesses, can access health care at all levels for medication, rehabilitation and other health needs.
Patients may go on their own from OAHs, their houses or residencies to and from clinics or hospitals when necessary.
Transport may be provided by some OAHs.
In addition, the Department checks on the nutrition aspect of meals served at OAHs for the elderly.
Home-based care is also available to the Aged and can be accessed via the community health centres in the Metro.
This service will become available to the Aged in the rural areas after March 2004.
ABUSE OF THE ELDERLY
Abuse of elderly people is a serious problem and is dealt with jointly by the provincial Departments of Social Development and Health, and sometimes the Department of Community Safety.
The new Aged Persons' Bill / Act deals with abuse of the Aged, and who should report the incidence.
The causes of abuse are varied however it is more likely to occur if the older person is physically dependent, lacks sufficient income to be self-sufficient, cannot remember, or becomes indecisive and confused.
Other possible factors include poverty, unemployment, inappropriate housing, marital difficulties, alcohol and drug abuse and poor communication with or by the older person.
Of the five areas of abuse (physical, emotional, financial, neglect and sexual), physical is the most harmful, causing physical, emotional and psychological pain and distress.
Health staff at all levels of care can inform family and friends about what to look out for if they suspect that there is abuse of the elderly, whether it happens in the older person's home, an OAH / old age institution or other places of board and lodging.
Health staff will keep a register of all reported cases of abuse.
Families and the public can report abuse to their nearest Welfare office.
There is also a national helpline (0800 0030 81) to report abuse.
By phoning the social welfare services in an emergency, an older person can be placed into a safe place at a few old age homes for a short time until accommodation can be arranged or the problem is sorted out.
ASSISTIVE DEVICES
Health services offer assistive devices such as wheelchairs to the elderly to make them less dependent.
They can also be encouraged to join support groups for the elderly.
Elderly folk should be encouraged to stay in their own homes with support for as long as they can.
Older persons should know their rights so that they are empowered to report circumstances that are not desirable.
First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
There were plans to make all assistive devices free of charge from July 1, 2003.

Home > Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Voluntary Testing and Counselling
The decision to be tested is a voluntary one - no one can be forced to have an HIV test.
The three main steps to be followed are pre-test counselling, testing and post-test counselling.
* Pre-test counselling
* Testing
* Post-test counselling
PRE-TEST COUNSELLING
The discussion is private and confidential and includes information about HIV/AIDS and the test itself.
Proxy consent can also be given.
This is when a person is legally entitled to give consent on behalf of another individual.
For example, a parent or guardian of a child below the age of 14 may give consent for an HIV test for the child.
However, children who are 14 years and older who have consented to a test must be given their test results.
This information may not be given to their parents without their consent.
TESTING
HIV testing for an employee in the workplace is prohibited unless justified by an order of the Labour Court, in accordance with the Employment Equity Act No 55 of 1998 Section 7(2).
The HIV test is an accurate scientific test to show if a person has been infected with HIV and is usually done on a person's blood.
Most testing sites use a Rapid Test, which means that the test results are available after about 20 minutes.
POST-TEST COUNSELLING
The rapid test results are given during the post-test counselling session.
This session is also confidential and it is against the law for any health care worker/counsellor to give a test result whether it is positive or negative to any other person without the permission of the individual who has had the test.
If the test result is HIV-negative, the individual will be counselled on the dangers of risky sexual behaviour and educated about safer sex practices such as using condoms.
If the individual is HIV-positive they will be counselled on how to deal with the news, and will be given information about safer sex practices and nutrition.
Lay counsellors in the province are trained by the Aids Training and Information Centre (ATICC) based in Plumstead, Cape Town.
Only volunteers working with NGOs in the field of HIV/Aids can apply for training.
If you have any questions about HIV/Aids you can phone the free 24-hour Aids Helpline at 0800 012 322.

WHAT IS HIV INFECTION?
HIV or the human immunodeficiency virus, causes HIV infection.
Once a person becomes infected with this virus he/she is infected for life.
In the long term HIV causes AIDS (The Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
AIDS may only develop after many years of being infected with HIV.
The HIV is passed from person to person in body fluids.
The most likely way to catch the virus is through being exposed to an infected person's sexual fluids during sex.
One in every six to eight people in South Africa is HIV positive.
You do not need to have many sexual partners, nor do you need to have sex often to catch HIV.
HIV may also be passed by blood or from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding.
It is NOT passed by kissing, sharing plates or forks, or using the same toilet.
PREVENTION AND AWARENESS
Prevention and awareness remains the cornerstone of the Department of Health's approach to dealing with HIV/Aids.
This is based on the ABCs - Abstain, Be mutually faithful, and Consistently Use Condoms:
* Abstain from Sex - This is the only guaranteed protection from HIV infection.
* Be mutually faithful - Always have sex with the same person.
This person also must not have sex with anyone else and not have been infected with HIV or other Sexually Transmitted Infections.
* Consistently Use Condoms - Use them every time you have sexual intercourse and use them correctly.
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM:
Your body has an immune system that defends your body and keeps you well.
HIV attacks and kills the "soldiers" in the immune system (called CD4 cells).
Without these CD4 cells your body is unable to defend itself from germs.
It takes the HIV many years (between 3 and 20) to damage all the CD4 cells so it is a long while before there are too few to defend your body.
There are many years after infection when a person can remain well.
STAGES OF HIV INFECTION
Stage 1: During this time the "soldiers" are still relatively strong.
A person with stage 1 HIV usually looks and feels well.
Glands causing swellings in the neck or groin are common- these show that the immune system is fighting the HIV.
Stage 2: As the CD4 count becomes lower minor illnesses may develop, such as skin rashes or diarrhoea.
People with Stage 2 infection may lose some weight.
Stage 3: Tuberculosis is a common stage 3 illness in the Western Cape.
People with stage 3 illness may see thrush in their mouths.
More weight loss or diarrhoea may occur in stage 3.
Other infections, like pneumonia, may occur.
Stage 4: An HIV infected person with Stage 4 illness is at risk of developing opportunistic infections.
These are infections, which only happen in people with very weak immune systems (CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3).
Once one of these illnesses occurs, the person is said to have AIDS.
Many of the illnesses that HIV infected people develop are treatable, particularly when diagnosed early.
Some others can be prevented.
It is very important that HIV infected people go to see their nurse or doctor if they become unwell, to get problems treated as soon as possible.
WHAT IS ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY?
Antiretrovirals are medicines given to people with HIV to suppress the virus in their blood.
THEY ARE NOT A CURE FOR HIV/AIDS.
They lower the level of the virus in the blood.
This allows the immune system to recover (the CD4 count may increase).
People taking antiretrovirals may find that their appetite improves, they pick up weight and problems they had, such as diarrhoea or skin rashes, clear up.
If antiretrovirals are taken reliably and correctly, the medicines can reduce the virus to a level in the blood when it can no longer be measured (undetectable).
WHO SHOULD TAKE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY?
People who are infected with HIV do not need antiretroviral treatment while their immune system is still strong (Stages 1, 2 and 3).
Antiretroviral treatment is only needed once the immune system has become weak.
Antiretroviral treatment should be considered if an HIV infected adult has a CD4 count People who are infected with HIV do not need antiretroviral treatment while their immune system is still strong (Stages 1, 2 and 3).
People considering antiretroviral therapy must be prepared to take tablets every day, twice a day.
People with substance abuse problems, eg drinking alcohol excessively, find it very difficult to take medicines reliably every day.
COMPREHENSIVE HIV CARE
Antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) form part of the care of HIV infected people.
HIV positive people can live healthily for many years before they reach the point where they require treatment with ARVs.
It is very important that people living with HIV attend their primary health care facility for regular follow up.
People living with HIV should go to their primary health care facility promptly if they become unwell.
If an HIV-infected person notices any of the following problems, it is important that they visit their primary health care facility for a check-up:
* Ongoing cough (>2 weeks)
* Marked loss of weight (a few kilograms)
* Ongoing night sweating (> 2 weeks)
* Loose stools or diarrhoea for more than 2 weeks
* Severe headaches or depression
* Any other symptoms that worry them
GETTING ACCESS TO ARVS
Antiretroviral therapy is available at designated sites throughout the province.
HIV infected people who require antiretroviral therapy may access antiretroviral treatment by referral from their primary care facility.
All primary care facilities in the province can refer clients for antiretroviral therapy at antiretroviral sites.
Also hospitals will ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).

Treatment of Opportunistic Infections
Treatment is available for opportunistic infections that, unlike HIV, are mostly curable.
These include diarrhoea, tuberculosis, pneumonia and candida (oral or vaginal thrush), which an HIV-positive person can pick up easily because their immune system is weakened by HIV.
Treatment for opportunistic infections is available for people who are both HIV-positive and HIV-negative.
Anyone who has symptoms of these opportunistic infections can go to a clinic were they will be treated with antibiotics that have been shown to reduce the number of opportunistic infections in Aids by 50%.
The province is also part of the Diflucan Partnership Programme, which makes the drug Diflucan available at 62 facilities, 39 of which are primary health clinics.
You can get treatment at all primary health care facilities.
There are also 20 dedicated Aids clinics in the province to which you could be referred.

Home > Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT)
Mother to child transmission happens when HIV, the virus that causes Aids, is passed from a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy, during birth or during breastfeeding.
The PMTCT progamme aims to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from the mother to her baby.
* What is the PMTCT programme?
* Infant feeding
* The baby's health and development
* The mother's health and development
* Getting Nevirapine
WHAT IS THE PMTCT PROGRAMME?
When a mother goes to the clinic, Midwife Obstetric Unit or hospital for her first antenatal visit, she is given counselling and is asked if she wants to take an HIV test.
The results are confidential, which means that only the counsellor and healthcare workers looking after the mother will discuss the results.
If the mother takes the test and is found to be HIV positive, she will have the option to join the PMTCT programme free of charge.
As part of the programme she will be given Nevirapine and Zidovudine, anti-HIV medicine.
The mother must take the Zidovudine from 34 weeks pregnancy, and will be given Nevirapine when she goes into labour and reports at the hospital or MOU.
These medicines in syrup form, will also be given to the baby within 6-72 hours of birth.
It's important to note that:
* The medication only reduces the chance of passing the virus in the mother's body to the baby during delivery.
Transmission during delivery is the most common factor, accounting for 60-85% of transmissions of the virus from the mother to her baby.
* Babies who get the virus while the mother is pregnant or as a result of breastfeeding will not be protected by the antiretroviral medicine.
* The medication is only used to try and protect the baby.
It is not going to cure the mother of HIV.
Any mother who wishes to know her HIV status may access HIV testing and treatment through the PMTCT program at any antenatal facility throughout the Western Cape.
INFANT FEEDING
Counselling and advice on infant feeding for HIV-positive mothers is available.
Mothers are given a choice to either exclusively breastfeed for four to six months or exclusively formula feed.
Exclusive breastfeeding means that the baby must only be given breast milk, no tea, no water and no juice.
This reduces the chance of the virus in the breast milk being passed on to the baby.
Those mothers choosing to formula feed will get free milk powder for six months.
They will get two tins of milk powder on discharge after delivery and will also get eight tins per month at the local baby clinic.
THE BABY'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
The mother must go regularly to the post-natal clinic to have the baby weighed, to get immunisations, to be given milk powder and to get Co-trimoxazole, medicine to prevent pneumonia.
Babies are tested for the HIV at 14 weeks when they report for the 3rd immunisation visit.
If negative, the baby does not need Co-trimoxazole any longer.
If the baby tests positive then they must continue with Co-trimoxazole.
If the baby is positive, it will need special care throughout its life.
THE MOTHER'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
HIV can live for a long time (3-10) years in the body whilst the mother feels healthy and well.
For this reason mothers are encouraged to go to the clinic regularly to get medicine for opportunistic infections to keep healthy for longer.
She is encouraged to use condoms every time she has sex so that she can protect herself and her partner from contracting the virus, or from getting more of the virus if both partners are HIV positive.
The mother will also be given counselling about contraception options for after the birth.
The health worker will encourage the mother to tell the father of the baby that she is HIV positive so that he can also be tested.
This can happen with the aid of the counsellor or health worker.
It is important for the mother to join a group that will support her and give her information on eating nutritiously and how to look after herself and the baby.
Formal support groups are available and can be contacted through the local clinic.
Remember that the presence of maternal Sexually Transmitted Infections increases the risk of HIV transmission.
GETTING NEVIRAPINE
Go to a Midwife Obstetric Unit in urban areas and fixed or mobile clinics and primary health care centres.
If you are referred up the line you will be sent to urban or rural regional hospitals or tertiary hospitals.

WHO PROVIDES HOME BASED CARE?
HBC services in the Western Cape are provided by non-profit organisations (NPOs) which are tendered for and subsidised by the provincial government.
Patients who need ongoing care at home upon discharge from hospital are referred to a health facility at primary health care level in the area in which they live.
The nursing sister at the clinic or primary health care centre refers the patient to the NPO partner responsible for HBC services in the area.
The NPO co-coordinator (nursing sister) will assess the needs of the individual in their home and develop a care plan for them.
The sister then assigns a caregiver to the individual.
The caregiver will render the service according to the instruction on the care plan and the sister will visit the individual to make sure that the plan is being carried through.
HBC is not a 24-hour service and does not replace the family as the primary caregiver.
It is only meant to be a complementary and supportive service to prevent "burn-out" for caregivers who are forced to care for sick relatives.
TRAINING FOR CAREGIVERS
They make themselves available as companions, fetch medication, and do shopping errands etc.
Please note that this service has not been implemented in all areas.
Contact the Regional HBC programme manager for information regarding the areas where it is available:
* S. Cape / Karoo Region: 044 874 2172

* Westcoast / Winelands Region: 022 487 9305
* Metropole Region: 021 918 1508
* Specialised Health Care Facilities
All hidden costs incurred by the NPO partners are not adequately subsidised and in order to prevent a dependency syndrome, a small freewill contribution could be made to the NPO partner to reimburse transport costs incurred by their volunteers.
* Geriatric Care (Service)
Home > Directories > Services > Health > Maternal & Women's Health > Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy testing kits can be bought at a pharmacy.
The nurse will ask for a urine sample, which will be tested.
Once pregnancy has been confirmed there are several options.
If the client wants to keep the pregnancy, she will be referred to health facilities called Midwife Obstetric Units (MOUs).
These are birthing units run by midwives in the community for primary health care patients.
If the mother does not want her pregnancy, she is entitled to ask about other options including Termination of Pregnancy.
If you are a first-time visitor to a health facility, you will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Bring your ID book, any medication you are taking, and a clinic or hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.
Tests are free at state health facilities but check for availability, especially in rural areas.

It's advisable for expectant mothers to book their first visit to the clinic before 20 weeks or as soon as possible thereafter.
The mother's health is also closely monitored.
She will be weighed, her blood pressure taken and urine tested.
If there are no complications, she should return for her first follow-up visit after two weeks for the results of the tests taken during the booking visit.
After this she must return to the clinic every six weeks up to 28 weeks, then at 34 weeks, thereafter as indicated by the clinic/MOU staff. (Frequency of visits may differ from area to area).
Pregnant mothers are screened for possible risks to their health and the health of the foetus.
Both teenage girls and women over 35 years old who are pregnant are regarded as high-risk cases.
This means they are more likely to have complications during pregnancy and birth.
Pregnant women may also be seen to be high risk if they have raised blood pressure, a history of genetic disorders, a multiple pregnancy and if they have had previous surgery such as a caesarean section.
Mothers who are diagnosed as high risk are referred up the line to out-patient antenatal clinics at the secondary or tertiary level hospitals, where further investigations and screening tests are carried out.
Mothers with high-risk pregnancies are advised to attend outpatient antenatal clinics as often as necessary.
Bring your ID book, any medication you are taking and a clinic or hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.
Low-risk pregnancies are managed at MOUs (birthing units run by midwives in the community for primary health care patients) in urban areas, and satellite and fixed clinics in the rural areas.
High-risk pregnancies are managed at out -patient clinics at urban and rural regional hospitals and tertiary hospitals.
Services are free of charge.

Mothers who are HIV positive can join the Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission service.
Expectant mothers are encouraged to bring a birthing partner (husband/friend/relative), known in the service as a "doula" to assist with the birthing process.
It has been found that mothers accompanied by a doula need less pain medication because they feel supported.
Mothers can request a birthing position (e.g. squatting) that makes them feel the most comfortable.
The health facility gives all mothers a Road to Health Chart (RTHC) when the baby is born.
This card is kept at home and must be given to the sister on follow-up visits to the clinic.
The card is an on-going record of the child's health from birth to five years of age.
Bring the child's Road to Health Chart, if you have one.

Post Natal (After Birth) Health Care
This usually happens six hours after the birth if both mother and baby are in good health.
After the birth, the infant's umbilical cord should be checked at follow-up visits to the clinic every day for three days to make sure it does not become infected.
Clinic staff assist mothers with breastfeeding or other feeding options to ensure that the baby is getting enough milk.
If the baby has a low birth weight, mothers are trained in Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC).
This form of care involves dressing the infant in a nappy and a cap and placing the baby in an upright position on the mother's bare chest, between her breasts and inside her blouse at all times.
If possible, the infant must be fed mother's milk.
The baby's progress is monitored at follow-up visits to a special KMC Clinic.
The infant's father or other members of the family can do KMC as well.
The mother's health is regarded to be as important as that of the newborn.
Mothers are examined at the clinic on follow-up visits to check that the uterus (womb) has returned to its original position.
The clinic staff will also offer mothers counselling on available contraception /family planning options.
Some women struggle with the demands of being new mothers and clinic staff are trained to assess them to see if they are suffering from the "baby blues", Post Natal Depression or Post Natal Psychosis.
If there is a problem, the mother may be counselled, given medication or referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals for further assessment or treatment.

Child Developmental Screening and Growth Monitoring
Mothers/caregivers are advised to bring their newborn/s to primary health care clinics for regular check-ups.
Developmental screening is done as a routine during clinic visits for immunisation.
Screening for developmental disability occurs three times when the child is:
* between 0-6 weeks
* 9 months
* 18 months old.
The child is physically examined and observed.
The screening test helps to monitor physical and psycho-social development.
The tests evaluate whether the child is growing appropriately for their age and checks on developmental milestones such as sitting, standing, crawling, walking, talking and handling objects.
The child's vision and hearing ability is also checked.
If there is a problem, the child is referred to a specialist clinic or a rehabilitation professional e.g. occupational therapist where available depending on the problem and the needs of the child.
The screening test findings are recorded on a clinic card and a growth chart, both of which are kept by the clinic.
The RTHC card is an ongoing record of the child's progress and mothers must take them to all follow-up visits to the clinic.
Growth Monitoring forms the basis of comprehensive child health care.
It includes the regular measurement of weight (and sometimes length) of the child.
Weighing starts at birth and continues until the child is five years old.
Ideally the child weight must be taken once a month until the age of two years and then three times a month until the child is five years old.
The clinic sister enters the baby's weight on the Road to Health Card.
Bring your ID book, any medication you are taking and clinic card or a hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.

The strategy focuses on the child as a whole, rather than on a single disease or condition.
Sick children often arrive at primary health care facilities with a number of sicknesses and have to be managed in an integrated manner at home and at the clinic.
Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to five main diseases: acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), diarrhoea, measles, malnutrition, and malaria (found only in Kwazulu/Natal Mpumalanga and the Northern Province).
The Western Cape Department of Health guidelines have been developed to complement the WHO's list and adapt it to include priority conditions affecting children in the Western Cape specifically.
These illnesses are managed from when the child is one week old to five years old:
* diarrhoea
* acute respiratory infections (including asthma)
* upper respiratory infections (including ear infections)
* malnutrition
* tuberculosis
* child abuse
* meningitis
* management of the critically ill child.
Primary health care staff are trained to identify children who have these illnesses.
Sick children are assessed according to their symptoms and signs.
Treatment is given if necessary, and the caregiver/parent is counselled and is advised on the follow-up of the patient.
Severely ill children are urgently referred to hospital, moderately ill children get specific treatment at primary health care level and at home and those that are mildly are given supportive therapy and counselling.
If you or your child is referred up the line, you will be sent to a urban or rural regional hospital, or a tertiary hospital.
Services are free of charge at primary health care facilities.

Children that are suspected of having been abused can be taken to a primary health care clinic where they will be diagnosed and counselled.
The clinic sister or doctor will give the child a detailed physical examination and will also take a history.
It is essential that the abused child be taken to a health facility as soon as possible.
The longer the delay, the more likely the child will suffer severe emotional and psychological trauma.
Remember that some children are abused over years and they might not need a physical examination with the first visit, or they might be emotionally and not sexually abused in which case they will be counselled and treated accordingly.
* Child sexual abuse
* Child abuse and AZT
* Organisations combating child abuse
* The duty to report child abuse
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE
With child sexual abuse, special investigations must be carried out, such as specimens taken for forensic evidence.
Parents or caregivers should be counselled about the potential risk of the child having been infected with the HIV virus.
The caregiver will be asked for his/her consent for an HIV test to be done on the child.
CHILD ABUSE AND AZT
The anti Aids drug AZT (Zidovudine) will be offered to the child if they are brought to the health facility within 72 hours of being sexually abused.
The drug has NO impact in preventing HIV transmission if the child arrives at the facility later than 72 hours after the abuse.
Children covered by medical aid should get a three-day supply of AZT and a prescription for the remaining 25 days.
Those not covered by medical aid should be given a one-week supply and a date to return for reassessment in one week.
All children must be seen after one week for a follow-up assessment to get the results of all tests.
The rest of the AZT should be given at this visit (that is a three-week supply).
AZT is available at the 52 facilities where survivors of child abuse are treated in the province.
Children who are known to be HIV positive should not get AZT.
They should be counselled and referred to an appropriate health facility for long-term management of their HIV status.
Teenage girls who have started menstruating and who have been raped should get a pregnancy test to exclude existing pregnancy prior to the rape.
If they come to the health facility within 72 hours of being raped they will be counselled and offered emergency contraception.
ORGANISATIONS COMBATING CHILD ABUSE
To try and combat the unacceptably high levels of child abuse in the Western Cape, health services have joined forces with police, community safety, social services and NGOs.
Social workers have an essential role to play in helping the child to heal after the abuse.
The social worker will offer education, information and counselling.
If the social worker believes that the child is at risk of further abuse when discharged from a health facility and is in need of urgent protection, they can issue a Form 4 detention order to remove the child to a place of safety.
Also, if a child's mental state requires more specialist/ psychiatric interventions, the child can be referred to the appropriate health facility.
THE DUTY TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE
There are two laws which cover child physical/sexual abuse and neglect.
Section 15 of the Child Care Amendment Act says that any person who has anything to do with caring for children - for example teachers, social workers, and doctors - and who suspects that a child has been abused, must report this to the provincial Department of Social Development.
The Prevention of Family Violence Act No 133 of 1993 (Section 4) says that suspected child abuse must be reported to a police officer or a child welfare officer or social worker.
Various organisations can help in child abuse cases:
* Rapcan - child abuse prevention: tel 021 448 9034, fax 021 448 9042
* Childline South Africa: 24-hour toll-free helpline - 0800 055 555
* Police Child Protection Units
* Southern Africa: 24-hour crisis intervention service (Directory of Life Line centres and programmes)
* Rape Crisis Cape Town: tel 021 447 1467
There are 52 health care facilities in the province that are dedicated to the management of children and adults who have been abused.
If you cannot go to one of these facilities, go to your nearest health care facility.If you suspect a child has been abused, you can take them directly to a primary health care clinic.
Abused children can be referred to a clinic by the Child Protection Unit, a police officer or social workers

Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention and Treatment
Foetal Alcohol Syndrome or FAS is the most common preventable form of intellectual disability in the world and yet it is a serious public health problem in the Western Cape.
FAS describes children who have growth retardation and physical and central nervous system abnormalities as a result of being exposed to alcohol while their mothers were pregnant with them.
Alcohol can cause irreversible damage to the developing foetus.
* Preventing FAS
* Treatment
* Risk Factors
* How to get the service
PREVENTING FAS
The service is two-pronged.
Firstly, it aims to prevent FAS by educating, informing and counselling mothers about the dangers of drinking while pregnant.
TREATMENT
Secondly, it aims to diagnose and treat affected children.
Apart from physical abnormalities, children with FAS can also have neurological, behavioural, and learning problems.
Programmes are currently being developed to identify and assist high-risk mothers and to diagnose children with FAS as early as possible.
Although many of these children experience learning problems, stimulation and management programmes are being developed to assist parents and caregivers.
Should a parent/caregiver or teacher be worried about a child, the child can be taken to the nearest clinic from where the child will be referred to the most appropriate service for further assessment.
RISK FACTORS
Risk Factors associated with FAS include:
* Any alcohol consumed by a pregnant mother: It is not safe to use any alcohol during pregnancy!
* The time of drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
* Additional substance abuse.
* The older the pregnant mother who drinks alcohol, the higher the risk to the foetus.
* The effects of alcohol on the developing foetus get worse with every consecutive pregnancy, if the mother continues to drink.
* Genetic factors: the genetic make-up of the mother and/or foetus might protect them from or make them vulnerable to the effects of alcohol.
* The health and nutritional status of the mother.
* Poverty.
* Low maternal education.

Home > Directories > Services > Health > Maternal & Women's Health > Human Genetic Services (Birth Defects)
It is estimated that 150 000 children born annually in South Africa are affected by a significant birth defect or genetic disorder by the age of five years.
The National Department of Health focuses on 10 conditions with the most common conditions being:
* albinism
* Downs Syndrome
* Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)
* neural tube defects (spina bifida).
The Western Cape also focuses on these (except for albinism, which has a low incidence), with FAS being the highest priority.
The service aims to prevent children from being born with these conditions by providing timely and appropriate genetic counselling to high-risk individuals and/or couples.
In order to do so, these individuals first have to be identified.
They can be identified via the existing services at the clinics from where they will be referred to the specialised genetic services provided via outreach programmes in rural areas and at tertiary centres in Cape Town.

WHAT IS MALNUTRITION?
Malnutrition is a serious problem in South Africa and is one of the biggest contributors to childhood illness and death.
It is estimated that about 30% of South African children are stunted from a lack of adequate nutrition in the early years of their lives.
Inadequate food intake, illness and psychosocial stress/trauma are the most significant immediate causes of malnutrition.
Poverty and lack of resources are basic factors that contribute to malnutrition.
The INP tries to deal with this silent epidemic in a number of ways.
SUPPLEMENTS FOR CHILDREN
At primary health care level children who are examined and identified as undernourished (this includes children and adults who are HIV positive and with tuberculosis) will be given food supplements including fortified maize meal and a high-energy drink.
Supplements are given to identified clients according to criteria.
Health workers also provide counselling, information and education about healthy diets and the healthiest ways of preparing food.
Dieticians also provide specialised services to the community.
BREASTFEEDING
To help fight malnourishment in early childhood health workers encourage women to breastfeed their children exclusively until six months of age and thereafter to continue breastfeeding in addition to the introduction of appropriate complementary foods, until the child is two years old.
Other feeding options are discussed with mothers who are HIV positive.
Vredendal Hospital and Groote Schuur Maternity Centre are Baby Friendly Hospitals in the province according to the Baby friendly Hospital Initiative.
GROWTH MONITORING
All children are weighed regularly as part of the growth monitoring programme, a sensitive indicator of whether the child is growing.
The weight is entered onto the Road to Health Card.
Underlying causes for weight loss are looked into such as infectious diseases, shortage of food at home and child neglect.
Infectious diseases play a great part in undernourishment and these illnesses are treated at primary health care level.
Diarrhoeal disease is closely related to poor environmental hygiene (sanitation and water supply) and under- or poor nutrition of an infant, which in turn makes him/her more vulnerable to serious and prolonged diarrhoea.
POVERTY ALLEVIATION
Poverty stricken households are identified and referred to one of the government's poverty alleviation programmes.
Household food security is addressed intersectorally and appropriate interventions and support are provided.
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS
Controlling micronutrient deficiencies is an essential part of the service.
Micronutrients are natural substances such as vitamins and minerals, which are found in small amounts in food and are very important in maintaining good health.
The INP provides Vitamin A supplementation to targeted children.
Children who lack Vitamin A lose weight, fail to grow properly and are more likely to get infections and to die from them.
A lack of Vitamin A also damages the eye and is one of the main causes of blindness amongst children.
Children with low birth weights are given Vitamin A capsules, which boost the immune system and help with the child's developmental growth.
Infants from 6 -11months are given a single dose of Vitamin A (100 000 IU) to prevent severe illness.
Children from 12 months to five years old are given a single dose of 200 000 IU at 12 months then a dose of 200 000 IU every six months until five years of age.
Additional doses of Vitamin A are given to children who are severely malnourished, or who have persistent infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles or HIV infection.
DE-WORMING
Weight loss in children can also be due to worm infestation and this can be treated at the clinic with de-worming medication.
NUTRITIONAL ADVICE FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS
Nutritional education, information and counselling is given at all levels of care to people who have had strokes, who have hypertension, high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis.
PRIMARY SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMME
The Primary School Nutrition Programme is available at specifically identified sub-economic schools.
These schemes are currently run jointly with the Department of Education.
The provincial government aims to reach 125, 000 children at 847 primary schools in the province by 2004 with its school-feeding programme.
FOOD IN INSTITUTIONS
The INP also contributes to the institutional care of clients through food service systems for the provision of balanced nutrition.
First time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.

However, there are workplaces that are unsafe and that affect the health of the workers.
Occupational health professionals (doctors/nurses) at all health facilities are trained to identify, diagnose, treat and rehabilitate employees who have chronic diseases and injuries as a result of being injured in the workplace or being exposed to hazardous substances at work.
Inspectors from the Inspection and Enforcement Services of the National Department of Labour (see labour services) routinely visit factories and other workplaces.
They make sure the workplace conforms to the health and safety standards as set down by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993, which is administered by the Department of Labour.
The inspectors advise managers and owners on how to improve working conditions where necessary, and may enforce the labour law by serving contravention notices, suspension of services and prosecutions.
Environmental health practitioners who work in terms of the Health Act 63 of 1977 only check some workplaces such as restaurants, airports and sea ports, to ensure they comply with health regulations.
Here are some questions you can ask yourself if you suspect that your health is being affected by your place of work:
* Has the work I do caused my health problems?
* Does the work I do aggravate the illness or injury?
* Am I experiencing symptoms within a certain time of finishing work?
* Do any of my co-workers experience similar symptoms?
* Will what I am doing now, affect my health in 10 or 15 years' time?
* Is my work environment safe?
Remember that if you are injured or ill as a result of the work you do, you can claim compensation.
Compensation is administered by the Department of Labour and not the Department of Health.
You can be compensated for all reasonable medical costs.
Primary health care staff may refer you to a secondary or tertiary hospital depending on the complexity of the illness or injury.
The Reed Street Clinic in Bellville, Cape Town, is dedicated specifically to people with occupational health problems.
It is open one day a week and you have to make an appointment.
It is essential that you tell the nursing sister what you have been exposed to in current and previous workplaces.
These could include: noise, dust, asbestos, gas, fumes and vibrating machinery, as well as abnormal stress.
Reed Street Clinic has links with provincial primary health care clinics, private doctors and employers, trade unions, the Department of Labour, environmental health practitioners and Tygerberg and Groote Schuur Hospitals.
Depending on the complexity of the illness or injury you may be referred to Groote Schuur Hospital's Work Health Occupational Diseases Clinic.
Employees may also be referred to the Groote Schuur's Work Rehabilitation and Assessment Centre where they will be assessed and rehabilitated to the point where they will be able to return to work.
The employer and the health professional that attend to you have to complete forms according to the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act 130 of 1993.
If you are a first-time visitor to the health facility you will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Bring your ID book, a referral letter (if required), and any medication you are taking.
If you are referred to a hospital you will be asked for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).
Bring your hospital card, if previously registered at the hospital.

These infectious diseases include yellow fever, cholera, plague and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Port and Environmental Health is responsible for the three sea ports (Cape Town, Mossel Bay and Saldanha Bay) and the two airports (Cape Town International and George, which has temporary international status).
On arrival, a metro (emergency services) doctor will assess the person and the necessary measures will be taken (e.g. quarantine).
Water and food supplies to aircraft are monitored.
VESSEL INSPECTION
Vessels that seek entry to any of the three sea ports must submit a Maritime Declaration of Health.
Vessels are checked for rodents and a valid De-ratting Exemption Certificate is required.
According to international health regulations, an infected vessel must be fumigated.
Water and food supplies to vessels are monitored.
IMPORTED FOODSTUFFS
Imported foodstuffs are inspected at random for possible hazardous or toxic substances at all entry ports.
When goods are offloaded, they are usually removed under extended health guarantees and only released if the port authority is satisfied.
All shipments must conform to the Foodstuff, Cosmetic and Disinfectants Act, 54 of 1972.
PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICINES
Products are checked to see whether they have been registered with the Medicines Control Council of South Africa, or whether they have expired.
Hazardous substances such as chemicals, pesticides and fungicides are also detained
PORT EXPORTS
The port health authority will issue health certificates for export under certain conditions.

Physically and/or mentally disabled adults and children can be helped to reach and maintain their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric and social functional levels.
The service is essential but is not extensive and fails to reach many people in need due to a lack of resources.
Most public sector services are based in hospitals and special schools, with few services available at community level.
* Primary Level and Step Down Rehabilitation Services
* Secondary Level Rehabilitation Services
* Tertiary Level Rehabilitation Services
* Specialist and Academic Rehabilitation
Primary Level Rehabilitation Services are limited to certain community health centres and district hospitals.

However, all clinics do routine developmental screening for babies and toddlers.
When there is a suspected mental or physical disability the child will be referred to a specialist clinic at secondary or tertiary level.
At the same time the child will be referred to a rehabilitation professional e.g. physiotherapist or occupational therapist at primary health care level where available.
In addition to initial screening with subsequent referral, rehabilitation at this level is primarily focused on the management of acute conditions, home based visits, the training of family and care givers, screening for disability grants and consultation with NGOs, support groups, schools and creches.
Booth Hospital in Cape Town and Life Care in Pinelands make provision for low intensity rehabilitation and step down care while services for children are available at Sarah Fox and Maitland Cottage, also in Cape Town.
Clients will be referred to secondary or tertiary level care if necessary.
Tertiary Level Rehabilitation Services are provided by Tygerberg, Groote Schuur and Red Cross Children's Hospitals and the psychiatric hospitals (Stikland, Lentegeur, Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital), all in Cape Town.
Occupational therapy departments at Tygerberg, Groote Schuur, Stikland and Lentegeur Hospitals provide some vocational rehabilitation.
This involves mostly work assessment, which tests the readiness of clients to re-enter the open labour market after injury or illness.
If they are not ready, staff recommend they be placed in a protective workshop (sheltered employment), which falls under the provincial Department of Social Development and the National Department of Labour.
This service provides a high-intensity rehabilitation service for physically disabled adults.
There is an outpatient clinic for one stop assessment and management of the client's rehabilitation needs.
Multidisciplinary teams provide outreach assessment and training at clinics and in the community and helps clients to get the most appropriate assistive device (wheelchair or buggy) for their needs.
The team also helps rehabilitation staff in other areas to gain in-service training experience.
People who are physically and mentally disabled must first check if there is a service at primary health care level.
They will be referred up the line when necessary.First-time visitors to the clinic or secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Free at primary health care level.
Following Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang's announcement that a free health care policy for people with disabilities would come into operation on 1 July 2003, this service should be free.
This covers outpatient visits and admissions to hospitals, and includes disability aids such as wheelchairs and hearing aids.
The free service should include people who have permanent disabilities that have resulted in moderate to severe difficulty in living a normal life, older people who are considered frail, and long-term patients in institutions for mental health care.
The criteria for assessments and exactly how this will be implemented are currently being investigated.
Home > Directories > Services > Health > Rehabilitation > Assistive Devices
Assistive Devices
The service aims to supply, prescribe, maintain and recycle assistive devices such as wheel chairs and walkers and hearing aids to people who need them.
There are various centres in the regions where assistive devices can be prescribed, maintained and repaired:
* Metropole - Western Cape Rehabilitation Centre at the Conradie Hospital and Karl Bremer Sites in Cape Town
* Boland /Overberg - Bravelskloof Rehabilitation Centre
* There are six sites in the Westcoast/ Winelands region, which are based at the following hospitals: Stellenbosch, Paarl, Citrusdaal, Clanwilliam, Vredendal and Vredenberg.
* The South Cape/Karoo has five sites: George, Oudtshoorn, Beaufort West, Plettenberg Bay and Mossel Bay.
In general, assistive devices are in short supply throughout the Western Cape.
Services are frequently reliant on donations for second-hand items and the purchase of new equipment.
To get a wheelchair, or in the case of children a buggy (pushcart), you should go to the nearest primary health care centre which offers this service.
Bring your ID book, or in the case of a child, the Road to Health Card.
If you need an assistive device, you must ask for the orthopaedic aftercare sister or physiotherapist/occupational therapist at the nearest clinic or community health centre/district hospital.
A wheelchair will cost about R395, which can be used for life.
The buggy costs R25 and must be returned to the state if it is no longer needed.
The buggy will be re-sold but at a lower cost.
All assistive devices can be paid off in monthly instalments.
Following Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang's announcement that a free health care policy for people with disabilities would come into operation on July 1, 2003, this service should be free.
Home > Directories > Services > Health > Rehabilitation > Prosthetic and Orthotic Services
The whole of the Western Cape is served by a single Orthotic and Prosthetic Centre in Pinelands, Cape Town.
Orthotic devices are used to optimise functional mobility in a disabled person e.g. shoe inserts, and ankle-foot orthoses, which stabilise the ankle after a stroke.
Prosthetic devices, on the other hand, replace a body part after the loss of a limb either by birth or due to an accident.
The centre is responsible for providing orthotic and prosthetic services to all the four Western Cape regions excluding the South/Cape Karoo, which has outsourced this service to a private service provider.
You have to be referred to the Pinelands centre by either an orthopaedic surgeon/orthopaedic sister/physiotherapist or occupational therapist.
Staff from the centre offer outreach programmes at satellite clinics in the various regions once every three months.
Callipers are available for people who have polio, neurological disorders, strokes and low muscle tone.
People who are physically and mentally disabled must first check to see if there is a service at primary health care level.
They will be referred up the line when necessary.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.

Termination of Pregnancy (TOP)
* Who can get a termination?
* Where can you get the service?
* How can you get the service?
WHO CAN GET A TERMINATION?
Any women (irrespective of age) can get a legal abortion for an unwanted pregnancy according to the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy Act no 92 of 1996.
Pre- and post- TOP counselling that is not prescriptive should be provided.
Parental or partner's consent is not required.
Women are advised to go for safe, legal abortions rather than "backstreet" abortions that are likely to endanger their health and their lives.
Also see Contraception (Family Planning) for emergency contraception.
WHERE CAN YOU GET THE SERVICE?
To get a free abortion, the request for a TOP must be made at a primary health care clinic, where the pregnancy will be confirmed, counselling provided, an appointment made, and a referral letter be given to a facility where the procedure can be performed.
Not all health workers are willing to be involved in this service, but they are obligated by law to inform the client of her rights and must refer the client to a health worker or facility where she can get the service.
The service can also be accessed via a General Practitioner (GP) but a consultation fee will be required.
Marie Stopes Clinics and private hospitals also provide the service for a fee.
Any girl or women can ask for a TOP in the first three months (12 weeks) of pregnancy.
It is important to act quickly if an unwanted pregnancy is suspected.
If you are three to five months (13-20 weeks) pregnant, a different set of rules apply for TOP.
The doctor, in this case, will carry out the TOP only if:
* There is a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or foetus
* Having the baby will cause major social or economic problems for the mother.
* The woman is pregnant from rape or incest.
The service, however, must still be requested at a Primary Health Care Clinic.
The following private organisations can also be of assistance:
* Reproductive Rights Alliance (RRA): tel 011 403 2101, email rradmin@sn.apc.org or rracoord@sn.apc.org.
* Planned Parenthood Association (PPA) Western Cape: tel 021 448 7312, email ppawc@ppawc.co.za
HOW CAN YOU GET THE SERVICE?
If you are a first-time visitor to a health facility you will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.
Bring your ID book, your referral letter (if relevant), any medication you are taking and your clinic/hospital card, if you have previously registered at the facility.
You must sign an informed consent form giving permission for the TOP to be done.
Health workers who are unwilling to give the service for any reason must refer you to a colleague who is willing to do so or to the appropriate regional facility with a referral letter and a booking.
TOP is free of charge at primary health care facilities and when referred up the line.
Ambulance services are free of charge for women who have an abortion.

Some common STDs are gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, chlamydial infection and syphilis.
Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and some subtypes of HPV are responsible for most cases of cervical cancer.
Most STDs can be treated and cured.
However, Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) and the sexually transmitted virus - Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV) - that causes Aids cannot be cured.
HIV can be transmitted by sexual contact, by blood and from a pregnant woman to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.
Although HIV cannot be cured, its effects can sometimes be stopped for some time.
It's important to remember that other STDs such as syphilis and vaginal thrush increase a person's chances of getting HIV or spreading it to others.
This is a good reason for people with STDs to get treatment immediately and if possible, to be tested for HIV and counselled.
This can be done at all primary health care clinics and centres.
The HIV/Aids Directorate has started a pilot STD programme with a few General Practitioners in the province.
The programme makes counselling, diagnosis and treatment of STDs available in an alternative setting to a primary health care facility.
The GP will give a clinical examination and treatment for STDs if necessary.
The client will have to pay a consultation fee but the medication will be given free of charge.
Find out from your local primary health care facility where you can contact one of the GPs.
All primary health care clinics or centres can test and treat STDs.
If necessary, people may need to be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.
First-time visitors to the clinic, secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.
Bring your hospital card if you've previously registered at the hospital.

The World Health Organization says immunisation saves three million lives a year.
* What is immunisation?
* What diseases do children get vaccinated against?
* When must children be vaccinated?
WHAT IS IMMUNISATION?
The Department of Health strongly advises mothers to protect their children from infectious diseases by getting them vaccinated from birth to when they are five years old.
Vaccination is free of charge at all health facilities.
The Department also runs immunisation campaigns and health workers are sent to primary schools to immunise the children.
Immunisations are safe.
WHAT DISEASES DO CHILDREN GET VACCINATED AGAINST?
Polio is caused by germs (polioviruses), which attack nerves, causing weakness or paralysis of the leg and/or arm and if severe, may involve respiratory or breathing muscles.
Measles causes high fever and a rash and can lead to diarrhoea and dehydration, deafness, eye complications, pneumonia, brain damage and even death.
Haemophilus Influenza Type B (Hib) is a serious illness that affects mainly children under the age of 5 years, and death from Hib disease is common in children under the age of one.
Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver, which can cause liver damage, liver cancer and death.
Pertussis (whooping cough) starts with a headache, fever and cough.
The strenuous coughing bouts make it hard for a child to eat, drink or even breathe.
The germ can cause muscle spasms, breathing and heart problems, and death.
The chances of dying from this condition are very high.
Diphtheria is a dangerous bacterial disease, which makes it difficult to breathe.
Tuberculosis (TB) Meningitis is a serious disease that can affect people of all ages.
Those that get TB suffer from coughing for a long period of time, chest pain, sweating at night, weight loss and even death if left untreated.
In young children the TB germ may infect the brain and cause meningitis, or it could also enter the blood and spread to other parts of the body.
TB can kill young people.
The best protection for young children for diseases caused by the TB germ is the BCG vaccine.
Usually babies who were not given the BCG vaccine at birth will be immunised when they are taken to the clinic for the next immunisation visit, at six weeks of age.
Any baby under one year who did not get the BCG vaccine at birth must be taken to the nearest clinic, where the vaccine will be given.
Babies infected with HIV, who are sick and showing sign of Aids must NOT get the BCG vaccine.
The immunisation schedule below shows the ages for each immunisation.
It is important to complete the full course of immunisations as described in the table.

Retirement Age: What Are Your Rights?
AUTHOR: Cape Gateway
Eventually, everyone needs to stop working.
Some people prefer to retire at an early age while others choose to work for as long as possible.
Whatever your preference, you need to know what your rights and options are.
RETIREMENT AGE
The labour legislation does not deal directly with the issue of retirement age.
However, it does say that no one may be unfairly discriminated against because of their age.
This means that the employer and employee must agree on a retirement age.
There are three possible situations that you could find yourself in:
* Your employment contract requires you to retire at a certain age.
* You have agreed with you employer on a retirement age or there is a company norm.
* There is no mention of retirement in your contract and there is no agreement.
If you sign an employment contract that stipulates a retirement age, then you can legally be required to retire at that age.
The organisation won't be required to give you notice.
If the retirement age is not in the contract but is agreed or if there is an organisational norm, then the employer can give you notice requiring you to retire at that age.
The notice period will be the same as the notice period for termination of employment set out in your contract of employment.
When would there be deemed to be an organisational norm?
There is a general understanding that the "normal" retirement age is 55, 60 or 65 but this understanding is too vague to be useful in specific instances.
Indications of the organisation's norm can be found in:
* the rules of a company's provident or pension fund (but this is not definitive)
* company policy.
If there is no mention of a retirement age in your contract and there is no organisational norm, then you can continue to work until you are unable to do your job properly.
Your employer can only terminate your contract in accordance with the labour legislation (that is for misconduct, operational requirements or incompetence) and will have to follow the procedures set out in your contract and labour law.
The courts have found that it is unfair discrimination for your employer to terminate your employment services just because of your age.
For more information on the law around dismissals, see the Department of Labour's guide to the Labour Relations Act called "Know Your LRA".
WHAT IF YOU CONTINUE TO WORK AFTER THE RETIREMENT AGE?
There is no legal certainty regarding the rights of an employee who works beyond retirement age.
It is thus advisable for the employer and employee to clearly define the terms of employment after the retirement age, for example how long the employee will continue to work for and what notice is required to terminate the employment.
WHERE CAN YOU GET AN INCOME FROM AFTER RETIREMENT?
After you retire you will usually rely on a pension or provident fund for your income.
You can either draw a state pension or you can contribute to a private pension fund or provident fund.
For detailed information on how private provident funds and pension funds work visit the Black Sash and ETU paralegal advice website.

Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) and the Skills Levy
The Skills Development approach aims to provide a framework for developing and implementing sector and workplace strategies to improve workers' skills.
Part of the strategy is the Skills Development Levy, which is an amount of money that employers have to pay to SARS for skills development of their employees.
The National Skills Fund funds skills-development projects that don't fall under the SETAs.
An employer can get back 50% or more of the levies they paid to SARS from the SETA or the National Skills Fund to use on training and developing their own employees' skills.
The National Skills Authority reviews and monitors the implementation of the National Skills Development Strategy
* Who needs to pay the levy?
* How much do you need to pay?
* How do you pay?
* How do you get a Skills Development Grant?
WHO NEEDS TO PAY THE LEVY?
As an employer, you must pay the skills development levy every month if:
* You have registered your employees with SARS for tax purposes (PAYE), and/or
* You pay over R250 000 a year in salaries and wages to your employees (even if they are not registered for PAYE with SARS).
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO PAY?
You need to pay 1% of the total amount paid in salaries to employees (including overtime payments, leave pay, bonuses, commissions and lump sum payments).
HOW DO YOU PAY?
To pay you must register with SARS and pay the levy each month.
SARS will supply the correct forms to fill in (SDL 201 return form).
The levy must be paid to SARS not later than seven days after the end of every month.
HOW DO YOU GET A SKILLS DEVELOPMENT GRANT?
You can get money back from the SETA or the National Skills Fund to use on training and developing your employees' skills.
To qualify for a Skills Development Grant you must:
* Have paid Skills Development levies.
* Have a Skills Development Facilitator.
* Follow all the rules and regulations in the Act.

4 May 2004
AUTHOR: Professor Prakash Jeena, Dr David Luyt and Dr Adrian Morris (Revised by: Dr Robin Green - 2004)
* What is Asthma?
* What are the Symptoms of Asthma?
* How can Asthma Affect my Life or the Quality of my Life?
* What starts an Asthma Attack?
* How is Asthma Treated?
* Where Can I Get More Information on Asthma?
* Asthma in South Africa
WHAT IS ASTHMA?
* Asthma is one of the most common respiratory complaints in the world today.
* It affects approximately one in ten children (10%) and one in twenty adults (5%).
* It can occur for the first time at any age, even in adulthood.
* Although asthma usually begins before the age of five years, a few children affected will 'outgrow" it during their teenage years but it usually persists if contracted in adulthood.
* Asthma tends to run in families as do related allergic conditions like hay fever and eczema.
* It cannot as yet be cured but if kept under control those affected will be able to lead normal lives enjoying full involvement in sport and all other activities.
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA?
Cough, wheeze, tight chest, shortness of breath.
These symptoms are often worse at night and after activity/exercise.
HOW CAN ASTHMA AFFECT MY LIFE/ QUALITY OF LIFE?
* Nighttime symptoms disturb sleep.
Exercise becomes impaired.
* Work or school days are missed (having a family member or child with asthma also leads to days off work to care for them).
* Acute attacks and symptoms are troublesome, potentially dangerous and costly.
WHAT STARTS AN ASTHMA ATTACK?
The greatest tragedy of asthma is that it is sometimes not recognised and treated, in which case the patient undergoes needless suffering.
The exact cause of the asthmatic process is not well understood but it is thought to be triggered off by an allergy or when the lungs are irritated by something in the air.
A viral cold
A viral cold or the flu can make asthma symptoms temporarily worse and this effect may last for up to six weeks after the illness.
Allergies
Asthma attacks are most commonly triggered by allergies to airborne particles of house-dust mites, grass or tree pollens, fungal spores and skin flakes from furry animals such as cats and dogs.
Certain foods and additives can (rarely) also trigger off asthma when eaten.
Pollution
Pollution in the environment, especially cigarette smoke, car exhaust fumes and certain chemical gases can aggravate an asthma attack.
Even children will be affected if they passively breathe their parents' cigarette smoke into their lungs.
Sport and exercise
Sport and exercise, particularly in cold weather, can set off an asthma attack.
However with the correct treatment asthma can be well controlled so asthmatics should not avoid sport or exercise.
fact about 10% of Olympic athletes have asthma.
Emotions
Emotions such as excitement, anger, fear and laughter can all aggravate asthma.
Drugs
Certain commonly used medicines such as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory tablets may trigger asthma.
Environmental factors
Occupational hazards
Prolonged exposure to many substances is regarded to be harmful to the lungs, and by law such occupation-induced asthma is compensatable. hese include: organic dusts (wood,grain, grain flour, tobacco), isocyanates, formaldehyde, vapour, fumes (amines), metals (platinum, nickel, cobalt, vanadium), soldering and welding
HOW IS ASTHMA TREATED?
Asthma cannot be completely cured no matter what anyone says, but with the right treatment most asthmatics will lead completely normal lives.
WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION ON ASTHMA?
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Alternatively, visit the Allergy Society of South Africa (ALLSA) website or the National Asthma Education Programme (NAEP) website.
ASTHMA IN SOUTH AFRICA
Prevalence
There is undoubted evidence of a significant increase in the number of people who have asthma amongst all races in South Africa.
Over the past 25 years a 25 to 200 times rise in hospital admissions for asthma has been recorded in hospitals in Durban and Soweto.
For decades, allergic diseases have been recognised to be infrequent amongst Africans.
Consequently, recent studies have revealed a lower incidence of family history for allergy amongst them.
However, many more Africans who have a positive family history of allergy, develop allergic diseases as compared to other races.
The early exposure to foreign allergens from the newly adopted Western lifestyle has contributed to the higher degree or sensitization recorded amongst African infants than others.
These factors account for the increased number of African children who have asthma.
Risk of urban living
Studies conducted on rural Transkeians have shown that migration to urban and peri-urban settlements results in a 20 times increased risk of developing asthma symptoms, but asthma is increasing in rural areas.
In Cape Town, Durban and Transkei, grass, cockroaches and cat allergy have been identified as important trigger factors for asthma respectively.

Drive Smart - Save Fuels - Save Money
A large percentage of motorists drive vehicles with badly tuned engines, which means that money is literally blown out through the exhaust pipe!
The Department of Minerals and Energy urges fuel consumers to follow these consumption-conscious driving techniques to make each litre of petrol go further.
* Close the car's windows when driving, because an open window creates a drag that increases fuel consumption by as much as 20%.
For a person who spends R100 a week on petrol, 20% savings could mean saving R20 a week, which adds up to R80 a month.
That is money one could pay towards his/her bond or be money saved for a rainy day.
* Use multigrade oil in your engine because it reduces drag.
* Service your car regularly.
* Use a logbook to record your fuel purchases and kilometres travelled in order to set new economic goals and to spot radical differences in the performance of your vehicle due to mechanical malfunction.
* If possible establish lift clubs.
* Switch to radial ply tyres because they offer less rolling resistance and longer life than the cross-ply variety.
* Avoid driving with under inflated tyres because tyre pressure that is too low not only increases consumption, but also remarkably reduces tyre life.
* Accelerate slowly.
* Don't speed.

WHAT IS HERITAGE WESTERN CAPE?
"Heritage Western Cape celebrates, treasures, maintains and nurtures the diverse urban and rural heritage resources of the people of the Western Cape by promoting pride in both tangible and intangible heritage, particularly amongst the youth and previously marginalized communities."
In January 2003, Heritage Western Cape was established as the provincial heritage resources authority for the province in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, 25 of 1999.
It is responsible for promoting co-operation between national, provincial and local authorities for the identification, conservation and management of heritage resources for all communities in the Western Cape.
Conservation of heritage resources has cultural, political, educational, and economic value that can contribute to the successful development of the Western Cape.
Heritage Western Cape:
* Works with provincial, municipal and national authorities.
* Liaises with owners of heritage resources, communities, and all other interested parties.
* Facilitates the continued conservation of our heritage.
* Actively promotes the full diversity of our heritage.
* Identifies heritage sites of importance to communities whose profile, memories, and values were once marginalized.
* Treasures the cultural heritage resources of the Western Cape as diverse yet common, reflecting both the achievements and contestations of the past and a vision of a richly endowed future and a home for all the people of this Province.
Heritage Western Cape relies on the cooperation of:
* the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA)
* the national Department of Arts and Culture
* local authorities in the Western Cape
* owners and developers of heritage resources in the Western Cape
* the provincial Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport which has been given the task of assisting Council of Heritage Western Cape in the execution of its professional and administrative functions.
To ensure that it fulfils its legislative mandate, the Council of Heritage Western Cape meets regularly and has established the following committees:
The Built Environment and Landscape Committee (BELCOM)
The Built Environment and Landscape Committee is responsible for considering applications for permits and approvals including formally declaring provincial heritage sites, heritage areas, public monuments and memorials and structures older than 60 years.
The Committee also considers proposals regarding heritage resource management for certain categories of development and comments on applications in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act, 73 of 1989.
The Archaeological, Palaeontological and Meteorites Committee (APMCOM)
The Archaeology, Palaeontology and Meteorites Permit Committee is responsible to consider applications for permits related to archaeological and palaeontological sites and meteorites in the Western Cape.
Appeals Committee
An Appeal Committee has been appointed to meet on an ad hoc basis when appeals are received.

RSA Government Retail Bonds
In May 2004, the South African Government launched its new Retail Bond.
This is part of government's campaign to encourage saving.
A RSA Retail Bond is an investment with the Government of South Africa which earns fixed interest for the term of the investment.
You can invest any amount between R1,000 and R1 million for a period of two, three or five years.

* Further Information
THE BENEFITS OF AN RSA RETAIL BOND
There are numerous benefits to saving money by investing in an RSA Retail Bond:
Safety
* Interest and capital are paid electronically into your bank account, which is a very safe way of investing.
* This is a paperless investment registered into your name.
There is no physical certificate.
Guaranteed Returns
* You will earn a market-related interest rate.
* The interest rate is fixed for the whole investment period.
You will know exactly what your cash flow will be.
* You can choose to reinvest the interest that you earn at the same rate as your Bond and thereby ensure guaranteed growth of your capital.
No Risk
* You may not use the RSA Retail Bonds as collateral for any loan, thus ensuring that your investment is safe.

Beneficiary Nomination
* You can nominate one or more beneficiaries for your RSA Retail Bonds Portfolio.
This means that if you die, your Retail Bond will not be tied up with the administration of estate.
* If you do not nominate a beneficiary, the Retail Bond will form part of your estate.

World Heritage Sites in South Africa
There are 788 World Heritage sites across the globe which are protected in order to conserve their natural beauty or cultural and historical significance.
Sites listed as World Heritage Sites receive national and international recognition.
Six sites in South Africa have been declared World Heritage Sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).
They are:
* The Cape Floral Region
* Robben Island
* The Greater St Lucia Wetland
* uKhahlamba - Drakensberg
* The Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape
* The "Cradle of Humankind" (Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and Environs)
THE CAPE FLORAL REGION (2004)
The fynbos region of the Western and Eastern Cape has recently been recognised as a World Heritage site because of its natural beauty and scientific importance.
In total, the site covers 553,000 hectares of land that are particularly rich in plant species, representing nearly 20% of Africa's flora.
The unique flora of the region is of particular value to science as there is a huge diversity and density of Fynbos species within a relatively small area.
The species density in the Cape Floral Region is also amongst the highest in the world and it has been identified as one of the world's 18 biodiversity hot spots.
ROBBEN ISLAND (1999)
The historical significance of Robben Island led to its recognition as a World heritage site in 1999.
Robben Island has been used over the last five centuries as a prison, a hospital and a military base.
Many of its buildings reflect its history as a maximum-security prison and so symbolize the triumph of the human spirit, of freedom, and of democracy over oppression.
GREATER ST LUCIA WETLAND (1999)
The St Lucia Wetlands contain a variety of landforms, including coral reefs, long sandy beaches, coastal dunes, lake systems, swamps and extensive reed and papyrus wetlands.
The geographic diversity of the wetlands and their interaction with climatic elements has resulted in exceptional species diversity.
The mosaic of landforms and habitat types also create breathtaking scenic vistas.
The St. Lucia site consists of thirteen protected areas with a total size of 234,566 hectares.
The site is the largest estuarine system in Africa and includes the southernmost extension of coral reefs on the continent.
Some of the natural phenomena of the wetlands are: the large numbers of nesting turtles on the beaches, the migration of whales, dolphins and whale-sharks off-shore and enormous numbers of waterfowl.
The Park also has exceptional biodiversity including some 521 bird species.
UKHAHLAMBA DRAKENSBERG (2000)
The magnificent geographic features of the Drakensberg and the large concentration of rock paintings in this area, have led to the uKhahlamba - Drakensberg Park's recognition as a World Heritage Site.
The site is exceptional beautiful, with soaring basaltic buttresses, dramatic cutbacks, golden sandstone ramparts, rolling high altitude grasslands, pristine steep-sided river valleys and rocky gorges.
This diversity of habitats protects a high level of indigenous and globally threatened species, especially birds and plants.
There are also many caves and rock-shelters with the largest and most concentrated group of paintings in Africa, south of the Sahara.
These paintings were made by the San people over a period of 4,000 years.
The rock paintings are outstanding in quality and diversity of subject and in their depiction of animals and human beings.
They represent the spiritual life of the San people who no longer live in this region.
MAPUNGUBWE (2003)
An area situated on the northern border of South Africa, joining Zimbabwe and Botswana, Mapungubwe was the largest kingdom on the sub-continent, before it was abandoned in the 14th century.
The surviving palace sites and settlement area, as well as two earlier capital sites, present an unrivalled picture of the development of social and political structures over some 400 years.
The Mapungubwe cultural landscape contains evidence for an important interchange of human values that led to far-reaching cultural and social changes in Southern Africa between 900 and 1300 AD. The remains are a remarkably complete testimony to the growth and subsequent decline of the Mapungubwe state.
The remains graphically illustrate the impact of climate change and record the growth and decline of the kingdom of Mapungubwe.
CRADLE OF HUMANKIND (1999)
The Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and surrounding areas have produced abundant scientific information on the evolution of the human being over the past 3.5 million years, his way of life and the animals with which he lived and on which he fed.
The landscape also preserves many features of that prehistoric period.
The Sterkfontein area contains an exceptionally large and scientifically significant group of sites which throw light on the earliest ancestors of humankind.
They constitute a vast reserve of scientific information, the potential of which is enormous.

Health in Action: Poisoning
Children are natural explorers and are very likely to experiment.
It is not surprising that over 60 percent of cases of accidental poisoniong involve children under five years.
WHAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF POISONING?
The majority of accidental poisonings involve medicines and drugs that have been left in places that the child can reach.
Children often also try drinking household products such as paraffin and cleaning fluids, especially if these have been poured into bottles or containers that usually contain drinks or food.
Chronic poisoning, such as lead poisoning, may sometimes occur in children living in polluted conditions near industrial or chemical plants.
CAN POISONING BE PREVENTED AND WHAT CAN I DO?
Prevention:
* Make sure that medicines, drugs, cooking agents and cleaning products are kept out of reach of children, in locked cupboards.
* Use containers with safety screw tops for these products.
* Store them in containers that will not be mistaken for cold drink or sweet bottles.
* Never store food and cleaning products or food and medicines together.
* Adults should avoid taking medication in front of children, as children are great imitators.
* Avoid storing poisonous substances in unlabelled bottles.
* Keep insect and weed killers safely out of the sight and reach of children.
In industrial areas it is important that the environment is monitored to ensure that chemicals do not reach unacceptably high and dangerous levels.
The Right Responses To Suspected Poisoning:
* Find the substance or the container of the substance that you suspect the child has swallowed or touched.
Save this to take with you to the clinic or hospital.
* If the child is conscious and there are signs that he or she has swallowed poison, you may try and get the child to vomit.
* If the child has swallowed a detergent or corrosive acid, do not give him or her anything to drink, because the drink might react with the poison and do more damage inside the child.
* If the child has touched a substance that can cause poisoning simply by skin contact, remove clothing that might be affected and wash the skin, hair and nails - first with plain water and then using soap.
Finally rinse the skin thoroughly and dry.
* If the child has a poisonous substance in the eye, wash the eye gently with lukewarm water for up to ten minutes.
* Keep the child comfortable and take him or her to the nearest health facility.
Do Not Encourage Vomiting If:
* The poison is of the type that would cause burning in the throat and digestive system (for instance, battery acid, cleaning products that contain caustic soda)
* The child has swallowed paraffin because oily droplets may cause problems in the lungs and result in pneumonia
WHERE CAN I GET MORE HELP AND ADVICE?
For any poisoning, contact your local clinic for professional help.

Western Cape Youth Commission Bill
17 August 2004

* Leader of the Opposition
* Cabinet colleagues
* Members
* Chairperson of the Standing Committee
* South African Youth Commission
* National Youth Council
* Youth from political parties
* Youth from NGO sector and religious communities
Today I table the Western Cape Youth Commission Bill to the Provincial Parliament.
It is unfortunate that it has taken 10 years to reach this point, but this Bill will help strengthen us as we face the challenges of the next decade.
It may be late, but it could not have come at a more significant time in this tenth year of our freedom.
Population:
* 65% of the Western Cape population of 4 504 609 is under the age of 35 - we therefore have 2 928 000 youth
Learning:
* Only 52% of our youth who start Grade 1, finish Grade 12
* Only 26.6% of those who passed matric in 2003 got university exemptions, the overwhelming majority of whom were white and Indian
HIV - AIDS:
Pregnancy:
* 20% of pregnant women who attend public health clinics are teenagers
Substance abuse:
* The National Youth Risk Behaviour Survey of 2002 found that 9.1% of learners in the Western Cape had used alcohol on school premises , 4.1% had used cannabis and 19.6% had been offered an illegal drug
Sexual activity:
* The National Youth Risk Behaviour Survey of 2002 found that 37.8% of learners in the Western Cape have been sexually active
Employment:
* Only 3 out of a 100 Africans who enter the labour force find a job compared to 92 out of a 100 of Whites
* 41.52% of economically active Africans are unemployed compared to 6.89% of Whites
* 22.37% of Coloureds are unemployed
Skills deficit:
* 38 750 Western Cape learners wrote Matric last year, of these only 21 950 wrote Maths, of whom 4 301 passed on Higher Grade; only 12 110 wrote Science of whom 4 285 passed on Higher Grade.
* According to the HSRC, apprenticeships declined from 30 000 in 1986 to 16 500 in 1998.
* By November 2002 only 65% of eligible firms were paying the skills levy.
At most, only 10% of these levy-paying firms were claiming grants to train staff [HSCR].
The realities of day-to-day life that result from this picture are alarming.
The vicious cycle of cause and effect that still disempowers and marginalizes poor, African and Coloured youth must be broken if we are to build a sustainable and inclusive democracy for all of us - with confident and accomplished people.
If we are to build the Home for All, then the youth must not only be a part of our Home, but they must be an integral part.
The Home for All must serve as our guarantee for the future.
* A guarantee of new skills.
* A guarantee of more work.
* A guarantee of better human relationships.
* A guarantee of inclusion.
* A guarantee of recognition.
* A guarantee of prosperity.
* A guarantee of health.
* A guarantee of learning.
* A guarantee of respect.
On June the 16th this year, our Province formally and officially celebrated National Youth Day for the first time.
In Athlone in front of the National Youth Council, the South African Youth Commission, the ANC Youth League, NNP Jeug Aksie, student bodies such as COSAS and SASCO, Muslim and Christian youth structures - we undertook to begin drafting this Bill.
In record time we have brought it to Parliament.
I want to pay tribute to the drafters who have studied and assessed similar acts nationally and developed a worthy product for our Province.
It is important to note that we are able to establish this Commission in this year not only because of the political will that we have demonstrated, but also through savings effected on Government programmes, thus providing the resources we need.
This Province has never budgeted for a Youth Commission before.
The Bill is one of the Deposits in the first 100 days.
But it has a long term view and must be part of the change this Government is driving toward relevance, inclusion and sustainability.
The Bill will be gazetted tomorrow.
Then the process begins of public participation, discussion in the Standing Committee on Governance under Chairperson Patrick McKenzie and ultimately the adoption by Parliament for my enactment.
Cabinet has done its work for now.
It is now over to you.
I call on the youth of our Province to support the process and to influence the final Act in ways that will serve your needs best.
You must own it in every way as your own tool to build our Home for All.
Scrutinise the Bill.
Discuss it.
Debate it.
The proposed Youth Commission's role will be to help Government plan and then to monitor and evaluate the programmes of Government in terms of outcomes as they affect the youth.
They will also be responsible for promoting youth unity and patriotism and to serve as the connection with National, other Provincial and Local Government youth structures.
This Bill is an important advance on the National Youth Commission Act which has a socio-political focus in the context of nation building.
The Western Cape Youth Commission builds on this foundation to provide explicit youth participation in socio-economic development with a focus on economic realties and necessary skills.
These young leaders must be fit and committed representatives of our Province.
They must also demonstrate the gender, race, religious and cultural diversities of our Province in their composition and work.
The role of the Province's Youth Desk will have to change too in support of this new structure and its important work.
This will be a subject for discussion for the new Commission and Government.
The Provincial Youth Commission was not and may not be a flash in the pan.
In preparing for last year's Growth and Development Summit it was clear that we needed to understand the need for youth empowerment, hence the Youth Economic Development Summit before the GDS and subsequent discussions with youth structures towards securing a place for our youth to be heard and supported.
In closing- The Western Cape Provincial Youth Commission must send the clearest signal yet to our young citizens.
We are going to support them to:
* Say no to drugs
* Say no to unsafe sex
* Say no to gangs
* Say no to despair
To put it positively, youth development in all its facets is on the agenda for this Government.
You have a vital and fundamental role to play in building this Home for All.
In building your Home too.
Claim the space this Act will create for you and become the citizens that we need you to be.
I have pleasure in tabling the Western Cape Provincial Youth Commission Bill to this House and to the youth of the Western Cape.
I thank you.

Safety was increased in the first 100 days, through:
* training new Railway Police trainees at Phillipi College
* using paid Bambanani volunteers to assist the Railway Police
* upgrading police stations in high-crime areas
* establishing Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences units at police stations
* arresting drug lords
TRAINING RAILWAY POLICE
The new Railway Police, who will fall under the South African Police Service, first have to undergo training before they can be deployed on trains.
More than 400 trainees began their training at Phillipi Training College during the 100 days period.
BAMBANANI VOLUNTEERS ON TRAINS
The current Bambanani Safety on Trains Project, which involves volunteers policing trains, resulted in a decline in crime rates when tested in a pilot programme during the Safer Festive Season Programme from December 2003 - January 2004.
These volunteers will continue to operate, on a paid basis until the new Railway Police are properly installed.
MORE AND BETTER POLICE STATIONS
As suburbs and township in the metropolitan region of the Western Cape grow both in area as well as population, there is a need for more police stations to be opened to keep pace with this growth.
During the 100 days, new or upgraded police stations were opened to begin to meet these challenges.
On 30 August 2004 the upgraded Kleinvlei police station was also opened.
FAMILY VIOLENCE, CHILD PROTECTION AND SEXUAL OFFENCES UNITS
When the Detective Service of the South African Police Service was restructured, it was envisaged that isolated Child Protection Units would be replaced with Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Units.
These would be based in police stations thus bringing expertise in this field closer to the people.
With the opening of new FCS units during the 100 days, there should now be an FCS unit close to all Western Cape police stations.
Staff in FCS units have the expertise to attend to sexual crimes committed against women and children, as they have training which helps them to investigate these crimes appropriately and with due regard to the needs of the victim.
The FCS Units opened during the 100 days were located in:
* Wynberg, covering Steenberg, Diep River, Grassy Park and Wynberg
* Cape Town Central, covering Cape Town and Langa
* Bellville, covering Khayelitsha, Delft and Elsiesriver
* Caledon, covering the Overberg region
* Mbekweni, covering Mbekweni and Worcester
* Vredendal, covering Vredendal, Vredenburg, Clanwiliam, and Klawer.
ARRESTING DRUG LORDS
The presence of known drug lords on the streets encourages disrespect for the police and the law.
It was hoped that three such drug lords could be arrested during the 100 days period.
Two of these arrests were successful.
Home > Directories > Projects > Employment > 100 Day Deposits: A Working Home for All
Work opportunities and commuter transport were both set on the road to improvement during the first 100 days, by:
* Launching the Extended Public Works Programme "Saamstaan" (stand together)
* Opening the Athlone Taxi Office
EXPANDED PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMME (SAAMSTAAN)
The Saamstaan Programme will include suitable projects identified across provincial government departments and municipalities.
Critical to the programme will be a training component through which unemployed people will learn practical skills.
Some projects already exist and must be expanded; others have been specially conceived to get the Western Cape to work.
Public Private Partnerships are also being utilized as a funding mechanism.
New Saamstaan employment that will be created includes:
* safety and security officers in communities, on trains, at schools and other public facilities
* construction based work
* repairs and maintenance of public facilities and amenities
* home-based care of children, the aged and the ill
* early childhood development practitioners
* advisors on grant applications
* community development workers
* non-motorised transport and some public transport provision
* market and subsistence gardening
* upgrade of municipal roads, municipal pipelines, storm water drains and paving
* tourist guides
Existing programmes that fall under the programme include:
* Vuk'uhambe (Get up and Go; City of Cape Town) involving labour-intensive road works
* Red Door (Real Enterprise Development; Economic Development and Tourism) involving a network of 35 one-stop-shop support hubs for SMMES
* WECCO (Western Cape Cleanup Operations Programme; Environmental Affairs and Development Planning)
* Building Maintenance Programme (Transport and Public Works) involving nine projects on Health, Education and General buildings
* Zenzele (Transport and Public Works) involving a road maintenance programme
* CARP (Community Access Road Programme)
* Bambanani (Community Safety).
The provincial government committed itself to creating a minimum of 120,000 work and training opportunities over 5 years at the provincial Growth and Development Summit, in November 2003, and Saamstaan is the beginning of the fulfilment of that promise.
ATHLONE TAXI OFFICE
The minibus taxi industry is a key player in commuter transport, as it transports 45% of commuters in the province and about 60% nationally.
However, it is an informal industry, with no clear strategy to effectively harness the benefits from its market and social position, and engage with the business world to maximize returns for its members.
The purpose of the taxi office is to play a key role in addressing this deficiency, by
* forming the administrative hub of the minibus taxi industry
* creating a professional environment where industry issues can be discussed
* serving as the "headquarters" for the Western Cape Provincial Taxi Council
* serving as the Training Center for Provincial and National Training initiatives
* projecting an image of unity and synergy to the broader minibus taxi industry
* serving as a platform from where the industry can engage and interact with all relevant stakeholders and role players.
The taxi office forms a key element in efforts by the Provincial Government to maintain peace and stability in the minibus taxi industry.
A stable and peaceful taxi industry serves the objectives of Black Economic Empowerment while providing a safe, efficient and reliable public transport.
The Taxi Office is located in Athlone on Klipfontein Road, so forming part of the Klipfontein Corridor Project, which is part of the Provincial Mobility Strategy.

100 Day Deposits: A Co-operative Home for All
Co-operative government leading to increased delivery was promoted in the first 100 days, through:
* Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) projects
* Unblocking housing projects
* Creating disaster teams
* Promoting integrated governance
CONSOLIDATED MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME (CMIP)
The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) was developed nationally to support municipalities to provide new infrastructure as well as to rehabilitate and upgrade existing infrastructure, particularly in disadvantaged communities.
Municipalities are the primary providers of services to citizens.
This includes access to water, sanitation, solid waste management, affordable and safe energy, transport, education, health services and shelter as well as effective disaster management.
CMIP funds are allocated to seven project categories (water, sanitation, roads, solid waste, community facilities, community lighting and storm water).
CMIP in the Western Cape over the period 1997-2004 spent R689,1 million on 1063 municipal infrastructure projects, which also created approximately 2,411 million person days of employment.
During the 100 days, CMIP projects were handed over to the following municipalities:
* Witzenberg
* Beaufort-West
* Saldanha Bay
HOUSING PROJECTS
Housing projects may get blocked, sometimes because of the conflicting needs and demands within communities.
During the first 100 days, positive steps, such as the holding of community imbizo's to resolve conflict, were taken to unblock the following housing projects:
* Imizamo Yethu
* Avian Park
* Mbekweni
* Paarl
* Lwandle
DISASTER TEAMS
A framework was created for the prevention and mitigation of fires and slow flooding in informal settlements to ensure effective disaster management in these areas.
Areas that should benefit from more effective emergency response include Brown's Farm, Guguletu, Crossroads, Kosovo, Wallacedene and Doringwacht.
INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE
A co-operative government summit for all local government councillors was held 21 June 2004.
This should result in greater co-operation between provincial and local government.
* Department of Local Government (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
* Department of Local Government and Housing (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)
Home > Directories > Projects > Educational > School Development > 100 Day Deposits: A Learning Home for All
Learning was supported in the first 100 days, by:
* Electrifying nine schools in the province
* Completion of the new Usasazo School in Khayelitsha
At the beginning of 2004 there were still twelve schools in the Western Cape operating without electricity.
The schools are:
Main grid:
* St. Boniface Primary School, Rietpoort
* Rheboksfontein Primary School, Darling
* Seekoeigat , Southern Cape
* Voorsorg
* Bracken Hill
* Kliprivier
Alternative source:
* Klawerlei
* Nuwefontein
* Tanqua
Electrification is likely to have a profound impact on the learners in these schools.
The process of electrification will continue for the remaining six schools.
USASAZO SCHOOL
Usasazo in isiXhosa means "dispersal" or "scattering".
The word is an apt description of the history of this school.
For nearly 10 years now, this school community has been in search of a permanent home.
Usasazo is now finally "coming home" to permanent premises, completed in August 2004, in Bangisa Drive, Khayelitsha.
The completion of the school was promised by the Premier for delivery within the first 100 days of office of the new provincial government.
The story of Usasazo begins with too few schools being provided by the former Department of Education and Training in the pre-1994 years.
Increased migration from the Eastern Cape to the Khayelitsha region, following the repeal of the Group Areas Act and Influx Control regulations, further increased the demand for schooling in the area.
Various options were considered, and the Premier at the time, Hernus Kriel, helped to arrange premises in Ruiterwacht.
However members of the local community in Ruiterwacht staged notorious demonstrations against accommodating the children in the suburb and it became clear that the Department and the KEF that they would have to seek other solutions.
The KEF negotiated with the Maitland community to use an under-utilised school in the suburb.
The community of Maitland supported the proposal and agreed to merge two schools already serving the community, and to make one of the schools available to learners from Khayelitsha.
About 1,500 learners then moved from Ruiterwacht to Maitland to form what is now known as Usasazo Secondary School.
The Department made arrangements to accommodate the remaining learners in three other schools - Vuyiseka, Esangweni and Belhar secondary schools.
Belhar Secondary later changed its name to Harry Gwala Secondary.
The WCED and the KEF formed a panel to interview teachers for appointment at all four schools.
The first principal of Usasazo, Mr Kgati, is still principal of the school today.
The contractors completed the building work in August 2004.
The cost of the project was R10,7 million.
This must be balanced against the fact that in recent years, the Department spent up to R3.4 million a year to transport learners from Khayelitsha to available premises in Maitland.
The learners are not moving into the premises immediately, to avoid disrupting "mock matric" examinations, which end on 17 September.
In the meantime, the contractor will rectify any defects found in the building and ensure that the site is ready for the learners when the school moves in during the weekend of 17 to 19 September.

100 Day Deposits: A Nourishing Home for All
Agriculture was promoted in the first 100 days, by:
* Opening the Clanwilliam Agricultural School
* Pursuing an export agreement with the European Union
CLANWILLIAM AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL
Agricultural training became more accessible to the people of the West Coast region with the opening of the Clanwilliam Agricultural School on Friday 6 August 2004.
The school, a satellite campus of the Cape Institute for Agricultural Training: Elsenburg, is specifically designed for farm workers and under-resourced farmers in the area.
Satellite campuses take agricultural training to people who need it most.
The first satellite campus was opened in George in 2003, and courses have also been offered in Oudtshoorn.
Around 48 short courses in subjects like Agricultural and Financial Management, Life Skills, Vegetable Production, Fruit production, Viticulture, Animal production (large stock, small stock and poultry) and Agricultural Engineering are offered by the Cape Institute.
Opening of the Clanwilliam Agricultural School, Friday 6 August 2004.
These courses are offered on National Qualifications Framework levels 1 to 4 (pre-matriculation level), and about 2000 students are already trained annually in this way.
The opening of the Clanwilliam school should increase this number, once courses get under way in October 2004.
The Premier of the Western Cape, Mr Ebrahim Rasool, accompanied by the Minister of Agriculture, Cobus Dowry, opened the school at the Augsburg Gymnasium in Clanwilliam, meeting a promise made by the Premier for his first 100 days in office.
EXPORT AGREEMENT
It was also hoped that within the first 100 days an agricultural export agreement for the export of bone-in lamb could be signed with the European Union (EU).
This had been set in place through the signing of a protocol with the EU for the registration of sheep farms and the subsequent accreditation of a number of farms.
The abattoir in Swellendam has also been approved for exports to the EU.
The EU wished to inspect and approve the export system themselves before signing the agreement and were scheduled to do so in June 2004.
However, the National Department of Agriculture postponed the visit of the EU to the accredited farms in the Karoo, as they do not have sufficient capacity to handle the current outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Limpopo and of avian flu among ostriches in the Karoo at the same time as a visit from the EU.
The Provincial Department of Agriculture will continue to support developments toward the signing of the agreement, which is likely to be a boon to Karoo farmers.
Home > Directories > Projects > Recreation & Sport > Recreation > 100 Day Deposits: A Harmonious Home for All
Sport was encouraged and developed in the first 100 days, by:
* funding new sports facilities in rural areas
* creating and providing equipment for school cluster sports leagues
* developing sports fields at disadvantaged schools
* restructuring and building capacity in Sports Councils
SPORTS FACILITIES IN RURAL AREAS
People living in rural areas generally have access to fewer sports facilities than urban dwellers - but perhaps not for long in the Western Cape.
An R11m programme to upgrade or build sports facilities in ten, mostly rural local authorities of the Western Cape, was launched by the Premier and the Minister for Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation, Mr Chris Stali, in August 2004.
Celebrations at the sod-turning ceremony in Kayamandi
The "sod-turning ceremony" was held in Kayamandi (a township outside Stellenbosch) which is one of the selected communities.
The communities selected do not have any sports facilities at all or have poor facilities in need of upgrading, and the majority are located in rural areas.
The Building for Sport and Recreation Programme (BSRP) allocated R9.3 million to the project, while a further R1.7 million comes from the provincial budget allocation.
Transfer payments to the selected municipalities have been concluded and construction is likely to begin at the end of September 2004.
As many as 28 facilities in ten municipalities will be created or improved.
The municipalities which have received this funding are:
* Beaufort West Municipality (Rustedene and Nelspoort) R1.6 million for netball court, ablution blocks and new sports complex and rugby field
* Kannaland Municipality (Van Wyksdorp, Calitzdorp and Ladismisth) R1.25 million for development of rugby field, completion of multi-purpose sport field and renovation of swimming pools
* Laingsburg Municipality (Vleiland and Matjiesfontein) R1 million
* Central Karoo (Murrayburg) R0.35 million for completion of sports complex
* Knysna Municipality R0.5 million for completion of multi-purpose sports complex
* Mossel Bay Municipality (Brandwatch) R0.65 million for new sports complex
* Stellensbosch (Kayamnandi) R2 million for new sports complex
* City of Cape Town (Maccassar) R1 million for new sport complex
* Prince Albert-Klaarstroom R0.3 million for facilities lighting and security
* Swartland-Kalbakraal R0.6 million for new multi-purpose sport facility and field irrigation.
CLUSTER SCHOOL SPORTS LEAGUES IN FOUR AREAS
When sport fixtures are set between disadvantaged schools which are located far away from each other, many schools simply choose not to compete due to transport problems.
As a result, young sports players suffer a lack of competition.
"Cluster sport leagues" have therefore been piloted in four disadvantaged areas to bring schools in the same area together, so that appropriate fixtures can be set up between cluster schools, to revive inter-school competition.
Facilities, equipment, training and coaching are also shared among schools in the cluster system.
The cluster league system has been piloted at Hanover Park, Bonteheuwel, Gugulethu, Nyanga and Phillippi, where rugby, netball, soccer and chess are successfully being played in the league system.
The current winter cluster sport league fixtures are scheduled to finish by the end of September so as not to interrupt school exams.
Sports equipment worth more than R500,000 was also handed over to cluster schools by Minister Stali in July 2004.
The equipment was handed over to cluster committees rather than individual schools to ensure more children have use of the equipment.
The sports equipment included basket balls, cricket bats and balls, volley balls, hockey kit, soccer and rugby balls, training bibs, chess sets, and table tennis equipment.
A further tender for additional equipment worth R360,000 will be put out in September 2004.
SPORTS FIELDS AT SCHOOLS
Without a playing field, schools cannot offer many outdoor sports.
Seven disadvantaged schools were therefore given R184,000 each in August 2004 for the upgrading of playing fields, including the costs of landscaping, laying of grass and borehole irrigation.
The schools were selected on the basis of need - some currently have no playing fields at all.
The project is a partnership between the Department of Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation, the Safer Schools Project, the Department of Community Safety and the Multi-Agency Delivery Action Mechanism (MADAM), which brings different agencies together in combating crime.
The schools which received this funding at a ceremony in Mitchell's Plain are:
* AZ Berman Primary, Mitchell's Plain
* Luhlaza High, Khayelitsha
* Isalathiso Primary, Mossel Bay
* Dr Van der Ross, Belhar
* Swartberg High, Caledon
* Cathkin High, Heideveld
Seven schools rather than the planned ten schools were selected due to funding constraints.
RESTRUCTURING AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE SPORTS COUNCILS
Two interventions were made regarding Sports Councils in the first 100 days - a "Dispute Resolution Indaba" and a "Soccer Summit".
The Dispute Resolution Indaba was held in July 2004.
As many as 170 delegates from 40 Western Cape sports federations participated.
The Indaba was convened to find ways of lessening the administration burden on courts of sports disputes and improving capacity in sport federations.
High Court Judge Deon Van Zyl and Advocate Alex Abercrombie shared their legal expertise in the fields of sport law and dispute resolution.
The Indaba led to the launch of The Western Cape Dispute Resolution Forum.
The Forum should be functional by April 2005, once the appropriate legislation has been passed.
The Department of Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation is currently considering nominations for members of the Forum.
A transformation and dispute unit within the Department will provide administrative support to the Dispute Resolution Forum.
The summit was attended by soccer administrators from various bodies, including officials from the South African Football Association (SAFA) Provincial and National Executive.
Delegates adopted a strategy to remove the stumbling blocks that retard the development and growth of soccer.
This strategy included commitments to:
* Strengthen and formalise relationships between SAFA, the United Schools Sports Association of South Africa (USSASA) and the South African Students Sports Union (SASSU).
* Develop programmes to ensure capable leadership.
* Resolve relationship problems with local authorities and clubs.
* Focus on unity.
* Establish a provincial organizing committee to focus on issues of development, growth and governance.
* Hold a strategic planning session to develop a plan towards 2010.
These four deposits were all promised by the Premier, and have been delivered within the first 100 days.
The fifth promise, that of new mass-based sport recreation programmes in four nodal areas, is a long-term project which is still under development by the Department.
Home > Directories > Projects > Business & Economy > Small Business > 100 Day Deposits: A Prosperous Home for All
Businesses were stimulated in the first 100 days by:
* Further financing for the Real Enterprise Development (RED) Fund
* Launch of the enterprise "Incubator" project
* Supporting agribusiness and tourism projects
THE REAL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT (RED) FUND
Gaining access to finance is one of the most difficult problems experienced by small businesses.
Financial institutions have stringent requirements for loans, often requiring security, such as fixed property.
Yet entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs often have few resources and nothing to offer as security for a loan.
Lack of financing is a major factor blocking the emergence of new small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs).
Minister Lynne Brown raised R35 million in total for the Red Finance Fund during the 100 days.
A prerequisite for a loan from RED Finance will be that the beneficiaries participate in a comprehensive mentoring and skills development programme tailored for new enterprises and entrepreneurs.
This will help the enterprises which are financed to be sustainable - and therefore also be able to repay their loans.
The Department will also engage in a vigorous campaign to encourage financial institutions to change their standards so that more SMMEs may access conventional loans.
THE ENTERPRISE INCUBATOR PROJECT
Experts estimate that around seven out of every twelve new South African businesses don't succeed.
While some of this can be attributed to inadequate financing, a key factor could also be a lack of mentoring and support.
To address this problem, the representatives of the Western Cape's four social partners, Community, Labour, Business and Government, resolved at the Provincial Growth and Development Summit held in November 2003, to launch a trial programme to help 100 existing small medium and micro enterprises to succeed through intensive mentoring and support - called "incubation".
This pilot project was launched on 11 August 2004 by the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Tourism, Lynne Brown.
The Department will spend R1,2 million on mentoring and supporting these businesses.
Each enterprise will be given a business mentor for an unspecified length of time.
The National Productivity Institute (NPI) is also being appointed to undertake a diagnosis of each enterprise.
The NPI will then compile a report with a recommendation for each individual business, as well as identifying common needs.
This process will take approximately two months.
The Department will then issue tenders to service providers who may be able to serve these common needs.
SUPPORTING AGRIBUSINESS AND TOURISM PROJECTS
The agribusiness projects were targeted based on the criteria of the Ikapa Agribusiness Fund, which is aimed at the establishment of new and economically viable agri-processing ventures among disadvantaged communities.
The agribusiness projects are:
* New Beginnings Wines Project (Boland)
* Eikeboom Dairy Project (Boland)
* Inthaba Fruit Processing Projects (West Coast)
* Essential Oils Project (Central Karoo)
* Asparagus (Central Karoo)
* Rural Product Marketing Services
* Regional Opportunities Investigation
* Hydroponics Herb Farm (Central Karoo)
* Mariculture Institute
* Mariculture Project (Hawston)
* Langkloof Honeybush Tea Project (Overberg)
* Fynbos Export Initiative
* Fynbos Certification Project
* Rooibos Intellectual Property Rights
The Integrated Tourism Entrepreneurship Support Programme (ITESP) provides an integrated support to tourism SMME's, including access to capital, skills and markets.
The intention of the programme is to remove the challenges that prevent transformation in tourism and promote demographic distribution of ownership in the industry within the province.
A sum of R4 million was allocated for the 2004/2005 financial year, and a further R1.85 million has been allocated by the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) toward this project.
Approximately 36 SMMEs will benefit from the programme, 22 of which have already been identified.

Traffic Fines: Frequently Asked Questions
Each municipality handles traffic fines in its jurisdiction.
It is your right to view speed-camera photos and contest in writing any traffic fine you may receive.
1. What are the different kinds of traffic fines?
2. How long do I have to pay a traffic fine?
3. How do I contest a fine?
4. What happens if I don't pay or contest my traffic fine?
5. Where and how can I pay my traffic fine?
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAFFIC FINES?
You can get one of two kinds of fines, regardless of the traffic violation:
1. A Section 56 notice or Instant Summons is given to you by a traffic officer, usually for a moving violation.
It has a court date on it.
2. A Section 341 notice is sent to a motorist by post for violations caught on traffic camera or for traffic tickets issued in absence of the motorists (for example, for an expired licence disk).
It does not have a court date on it but is a first notice before summons.
The Traffic Department will issue a second notice before summons before actually issuing the summons.
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO PAY A TRAFFIC FINE?
A Section 56 notice serves as an Instant Summons, which means you have about 30 days to pay before your case goes to court.
A Section 341 notice is a notice before summons, not a summons itself.
You usually get two notices before the summons is issued, after which you have about another 30 days to pay (or contest your fine in writing) before your case goes to court.
In total, you have approximately three months to pay a Section 341 ticket.
Please note that the exact length of time you have to pay a ticket varies from municipality to municipality.
Check your ticket for the payment due date.
HOW DO I CONTEST A FINE?
You can contest your traffic fine in writing with the municipal traffic department any time before a summons has been is issued.
Remember to send a copy of your traffic fine along with your letter.
The traffic department will respond to your challenge in writing.
If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can wait for your summons and send your challenge, in writing, to the traffic department again.
The traffic department will then present this letter to the Prosecutor on your behalf.
The Prosecutor then decides whether to prosecute, in which instance the case will go in front of a magistrate, or to drop the case.
Please note that writing a letter will not delay the process.
If you do not reach an agreement by the court date, the case will appear in court.
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T PAY OR CONTEST MY TRAFFIC FINE?
If you don't pay or contest your traffic fine by the due date and do not appear in court to present your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued when the case goes to court.
WHERE AND HOW CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?
All municipalities accept cheques and postal orders by post.
For safety's sake, cash should be paid in person.
Some municipalities accept online bank transfers or have an online facility to view photos and make payments.
Please refer to each municipality's Traffic Fines page, listed below, to find the best way to pay your fine and view speed-camera photos:

Home > Publications > Public Information > H &gt How to Save Water
Here are a few easy suggestions how to save water (and money) at home:
* Close the tap when cleaning your teeth (this saves up to 20 litres of water), or when shaving (this saves up to 45 litres!).
* A bath uses an average of 160 litres of water - a five-minute shower uses 60 litres.
Shower rather that bath, but if you have to bath, run a smaller bath or share your bath.
* Think before rinsing glasses and cutlery under running water.
* Cut down the amount of water flushed down the toilet pan.
* Check if your toilet is leaking by adding a few drops of food dye to your cistern - if the colour seeps into the bowl, you have a leak.
A toilet leak can waste up to 30 litres of water an hour!
* A dripping tap (one drop per second) could waste up to 30 litres of water an hour - which adds up to 10,000 litres a year!)
* Make a point of checking for toilet and tap leaks in your home, school or workplace and engage a plumber to repair any problems.
In most instances the money it will cost to repair the leaks can be recovered through lower water bills over a period of time (usually less than a year).
* Do you wash your car with a hosepipe?
Consider using two buckets of water to wash your car.
This can save you up to 300 litres of water each time.
Saving water in the garden:
* Lawns are generally grossly over-watered and use up to four times more water than other plants.
Check your irrigation system, does your water run down the street?
* Only water your garden before 10:00 or after 16:00.
* Consider re-using your bath water and sink water on your garden.
Professional grey-water recycling systems are available on the market.
* Remember this tip: watering your garden less frequently, but deeper (for longer), actually encourages a deeper root system, which results in stronger plants.
This practice can make water wise plants out of most established plants.
And for the Industrial and Commercial Sector:
* Does the factory or building you work in, manage, or own, have automatic flushing urinals?
These are the ultimate water wasters.
If you cannot immediately have these modified to be user activated, please turn off the water after hours and over weekends.
As an example schools doing this have saved up to R5,000 on their annual water bill.
* Does your building Manager still wash down forecourts and paved areas with a hosepipe?
This practice is literally water down the drain (and that means money too).
* Have you had your plumbing checked for leaks?
* Maintenance on toilet fittings can also save thousands of litres of unnecessarily flushed water.
Toilets should flush for two to four seconds and urinals six to eight seconds, maximum.
It can be a simple exercise to save 10% on your annual water bill, without drastically changing your lifestyle.

10 Reasons for Supporting Immunisation
1. Polio and measles are highly infectious diseases that are life-threatening and often result in long-term damage and disability.
2. Immunisation is a highly effective, affordable way to combat these diseases and protect all our children.
3. Immunisation is also very safe.
The risk of an allergic reaction is very much smaller than for most other medicines.
It hardly ever occurs.
4. Mass campaigns pick up the children that have missed some of their visits to the clinic for immunisation.
In this way more children are protected.
5. You cannot over immunise a child.
Even fully immunised children get extra benefit form mass immunisation campaigns.
6. The threat of polio and measles remains a real one.
Although South Africa has not experienced polio for years, it is still a problem in many countries and could be imported by a visitor.
7. Many of our children are HIV-positive and they are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases.
It is extra important to immunise them.
8. Immunisation is a social responsibility.
We can only create a measles- and polio-free environment if all children are immunised.
9. Many countries are completely polio-free.
South Africa is close to being recognised as polio-free by the World Health organisation.
An outbreak would ruin years of hard work towards this.
10. It is possible to eradicate diseases globally.
Immunisation enabled us to triumph over smallpox.
A polio-free world is a very real possibility.
Let us join hands with other nations to achieve this.

Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP)
The Programme's objectives are to use existing government and public entity budgets to reduce and alleviate unemployment and increase the ability of workers to earn an income, either through the labour market or through entrepreneurial activity.The goal is to alleviate unemployment for a minimum of one million people (at least 60% women, 30% youth and 2% disabled people) in South Africa between 2004 and 2009.
The EPWP was announced by President Thabo Mbeki in his State of the Nation Address in February 2003.
This nation-wide programme involves all spheres of government as well as state-owned enterprises.
The EPWP focuses on 4 sectors:
* economic
* environmental
* social development
INFRASRUCTURE PROGRAMME
This programme focuses on creating employment through civil works projects employing labour-intensive methods of contruction.
Approximately 37,000 km of roads, 31,000 km of pipelines, 1,500 km of storm water drains and 150 km of urban sidewalks will be constructed.
This will result in 750,000 employment opportunities for targeted unemployed people in the areas where the projects take place. (Since the average duration of these projects is four months, this translates to 250,000 person-years of employment.)
All the workers employed on these projects will receive training, funded by the Department of Labour.
ECONOMIC PROGRAMME
The economic sector's learnership programme aims to include 3,000 unemployed people in entrepreneurship learnerships over the next five years.
It is estimated that each micro-enterprise established will employ an additional three people.
The Learnership programme will help aspiring entrepreneurs to develop the skills and experience needed to set up SMMEs.
Learners will be registrated on full-time SETA-funded learnerships and supported to set up micro-business.
Learning contracts will provide practical experience for learners.
The learners will graduate from their learnerships with the necessary technical knowledge to run their businesses, knowledge of how to tender for public sector projects, knowledge of how to run a business, an NQF qualification, experience and a credit track record.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME
Approximately 201,703 jobs will be created through programmes such as:
* the Land Care programme
* the People and Parks initiative
* the Coastal Care programme
* the Sustainable Land-based Livelihoods project
* the Cleaning up SA programme
* the Growing a Tourism Economy programme
* Working for Water
* the Wetlands project
* the Fire programme
This programme will result in the clearing of alien vegetation from 200,000 hectares of land, rehabilitation of 40 wetlands, the creation of 20 fire protection associations, clean up of 700 kilometres of coast, trehabilitation of 10,000 hectares of land, creation of 32 waste management programmes and creation of 150 historical and community tourism projects.
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
Two programmes in the social development sector have been earmarked for the EPWP for 2004/5:
* Home Community Based Care (HCBC)
* Early Childhood Development (ECD).
The Home Community Based Care programme aims to create 122,240 work opportunities (17,400 of which will be through learnerships) over five years through a three pronged programme in partnership with the Health and Welfare Sector Education Authority (HWSETA).
The Early Childhood Development programme aims to develop skills amongst 19,800 child care practitioners over a period of five years, thereby increasing their capacity to generate an income and at the same time improve the care and learning environment of our children.
Economic Sector: to be determined
Environmental and Cultural Sector: R4 billion over next five years
Social Development Sector: R600 million over the next five years

What are Consumer Rights?
The 2004 National Consumer Survey found that very few South Africans know what their consumer rights are.
This short publication sets out the eight internationally recognised consumer rights that underpin consumer rights organisations and campaigns.
These rights are not the same as the human rights contained in the constitution, although they are complementary in many ways.
Right to Satisfaction of Basic Needs
All consumers have the right to basic goods and services such as adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, health care and education.
Right to Safety
Consumers have the right to protect themselves against unsafe goods and services.
Unsafe goods can lead to the destruction of property, injury and even death.
Right to be Informed
Consumers are entitled to complete information on price, quantity and ingredients from providers of goods and services.
Right to Choose
Consumers have the right to choose from a variety of quality goods and services sold at competitive prices.
Right to be Heard
Representation: consumers have the right to be heard on issues, policies, plans, programmes and decisions which concern them.
Right to Redress
Consumers have the right to redress on their grievances about substandard, unsafe, unduly expensive goods and services, unfair claims and other unfair consumer practices.
Right to Consumer Education
Consumers have the right to education that will empower them to take informed and confident choices of goods and services.
Right to Healthy & Sustainable Environment
Consumers have the right to live and work in an environment which does not threaten their health and life and which does not pose any danger to present and future generations.

* What Is Marketing?
* Four Major Aspects of Marketing
* Market Research
* Useful Links
WHAT IS MARKETING?
Marketing is the process businesses use to create and increase the number of products sold in the marketplace to a specific group of people that a business would target.
With marketing, you use knowledge of the environment and act on it in a particular way.
An official definition you may learn at an MBA class describes marketing as: "the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals." - Dictionary of Marketing Terms
Any business needs sales to be able to sustain the business.
Money made from sales needs to cover staff salaries and many other costs required to run your business.
Also, marketing presents the outside face of your organisation and it is important to make a good impression in the marketplace.
This makes your target market group feel positive about your business, which is your own brand.
The target market is the specific group of people you are aiming your product.
FOUR MAJOR ASPECTS OF MARKETING
There are four major factors in any good marketing plan:
1. Product - (the item, or service you present to the market)
2. Price - (the amount you charge for the product, service or item)
3. Place - (how and where you distribute the product)
4. Promotion - (how you communicate with the marketplace to let them know about your product)
These four are also called the Marketing Mix or the 4Ps.
1. Product:
If you know what it is that your target market needs and have the right product to match that, this means you have fulfilled the first requirement, namely Product.
Your product fills a market gap that is not being addressed.
To get this right, it is important to know your target market, and what they want and need.
The saying: "the customer is always right" has lots of truth to it, where they the customer will talk either with their wallets or publicly about your product.
It is therefore important to listen to them and act responsibly as a marketer to take their changing needs into account.
2. Price:
This is the second P of basic marketing.
The question to ask yourself is whether you have made sure that you have the best price for your product?
If you charge too much for your product, the target market group will not be able to buy it.
They may not be able to afford it, or the value of your product in their minds does not match that price, so they will not pay for it.
If you charge too little, the target market may think there is something fake or cheap and they may not want to associate with such pricing.
Also, it is vital to know what your competitors are charging.
Your competitor may have their prices wrong, and perhaps you can provide a better product at a better price!
It is a mix of gut-feel and science.
3. Place:
This is the third P which concentrates on how you get your product to your customers; from development to the stage where it is 100% ready for purchase.
Depending on your product, you will have different needs.
For example, fruit growers will need a team of air-conditioned trucks to get produce to the correct sites.
The other aspect of this is that you need to ensure that your product is being sold in the correct places.
If you have them on the wrong sites, then you will not be reaching your main target market.
4. Promotion:
This is the method you use to persuade your target market to buy your product.
There are various methods to do this, the most well known aspect of promotion is advertising.
This is when you employ an advertising agency to design ads for your product and put them in the papers or if you have loads of advertising budget, on TV.
Advertising is also called "above-the-line" marketing.
Other effective types of promotion are:
* Sales promotion - "marketing activities that stimulate consumer purchasing and dealer effectiveness through a combination of personal selling, advertising, and all supplementary selling activities" from
Examples of sales promotion are: In-store banners, promotional and corporate gifting and using a famous sportsperson to promote product at a mall promotion event.
This also used to be called "below-the-line".
Today many ad agencies speak of themselves, as "through-the-line" providing clients with all aspects of promotion, while others are "niche"; providing very specific services to clients.
* Public Relations (PR) - the process of making a special effort to communicate with your target market group through articles in the newspaper about your product and through special events, which will raise the awareness of your product and make positive associations with your product.
As a client, you will hire a PR agency to always be on the lookout for PR opportunities for the product of the client.
All these forms of promotion cost your business money, so you need to be aware of how much return on investment you are getting for your expenditure.
It needs to create sales growth for you, or there is a problem with the promotion aspect of the marketing mix.
MARKET RESEARCH
For you, your ad agency and the PR agency to know the best ways to talk to your consumer or target market group, it is important that from time to time you conduct market research.
This is when you design questions about your product to find out how the market sees it.
From market feedback, you are able to make adjustments in your marketing plan and sometimes even your business plan to improve the business as a whole.
Research can be large scale or small scale and can use quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (descriptive) measures.

Managing a Small Business : Management
It is very important to plan for the future of your business.
If you do not look ahead, there may be events that come your way which you do not know how to deal with.
When this happens, you end up reacting to a situation rather than having a calm approach when dealing with a problem.
Most business problems can be solved if you can minimise the surprises that come along the way.
Reacting to a problem instead of having a general plan beforehand can lead to bad business decisions that could harm the business long term.
In any business situation you would like to be in a position to take advantage of opportunities, and not be one-step behind fixing up old problems that could have been avoided through careful business planning.
How often should business planning be done?
Generally, business planning is an ongoing process.
This process should be done before the start of every month cycle.
How does one do a business plan?
Commit on paper what your the sales objectives are and any other goals you need to achieve to improve the business.
Once this is listed, and the month is complete, you can compare whether you have achieved these sales and the other goals at the end of each month.
How do I stay on top of my field, even if I am a small business?
You can do this review with other members of staff or an advisor who specializes in your field of business.
Getting insight from throughout the business is useful and helps brainstorm future ideas for your business that may not have come up in day-to-day activities.
An annual review is hard work but in most cases creates opportunities.
This is especially true if you wish to grow your business, or launch internationally.
IMPORTANT AREAS OF BUSINESS PLANNING
Employment
Example: "What are your future staffing needs?"
You also need to know when you can afford to hire more staff and what you can afford to pay them.
Cash flow
In some organizations, especially small businesses, it is important to negotiate with your clients that they split payments (for example you get paid 10% up front, 30% when you complete the first phase of the project and the remainder when the entire project is completed).
Sales
You need to know when there are slow times in your business.
For some businesses, this could be during the winter months, for others winter could be the busiest season.
To make sure you last - and thrive - from year to year, you will need to know your sales pattern over the year, so that you can make allowance for any times when there is not the same amount of money coming in from sales (sales fluctuation).
If this is not worked out well, the business will not be able to pay its bills and will be threatened.
If you plan properly for sales fluctuations, you will have money to tide you over in the slow months.

Managing a Small Business : Human Resources
Human resource management relates to all matters in connection with your staff; from recruitment to grievances and termination of employment.
Managing your Valuable Resources: Staff
How often have you heard business people say that their greatest assets are their employees?
This is generally true, but how do you nurture these assets so they continue to contribute value to your business?
These are the most important areas:
* The salaries and wages you pay staff need to be competitive.
You need to know what your business can afford and what industry standards are.
If you can't pay as much as your competitors do, you should offer your employees some form of bonus based on the how profitable the business is.
* Working conditions must be in line with the health and safety standards of the law.
* You must have a written employment contract with every employee, and you must ensure that they understand the rules of their employment.
This is especially important with matters connected to:
* absenteeism
* sick pay
* under-performance
* grievance procedures.
Consider what would happen if a key person in your business suddenly could not work for an extended period of time.
It is important to know when it is time to get formal Human Resource support for your business.
Once a business reaches a specific size, you may find it necessary to employ a Human Resources Manager.
The Social Plan Fund
If your business experiences the threat of job losses or the whole business is itself threatened, and it can be shown that if this happens, it will affect the local, regional or national industry or sector seriously; then assistance from the government can be applied for in the form of the Social Plan Fund.
This assistance includes information and services to retrenched workers and employers.
The aim of the information is to try and absorb retrenched workers into the labour market.
This is probably more appropriate for big businesses or industries such as clothing, mining or telecommunications where employees can be vulnerable to large scale retrenchments when global economics affect the industry negatively.
However, it is important to know about the Social Plan Fund, even if you are a small business.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES IN INNOVATION
The SPII Programme or Support Programme for Industrial Innovation is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry and administered by the Industrial Development Corporation.
SPII is part of a series of innovation support measures for South African industry, the most important of these being:
* Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) - administered by the National Research Foundation.
THRIP supports research and development in the industry with partners from the research, academic and industrial fields, to improve the quality of the products, services and people of participant companies.
It does this by providing resources and a framework for collaboration in science, engineering and technology.
One of the many success stories of this programme is the invention by a small business which now has a fully researched and accepted product on the market: a special camera which checks for errors on production lines using optical technology.
* Innovation Fund - administered by Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.
This fund has its focus on appropriate projects requiring funding of between one and five million Rand.
The projects are for larger, two to three-year collaborative projects aimed at technological innovation.
The Innovation Fund is not designed to support micro-projects that could be funded through other programmes like Thrip.

Testicular Cancer
* What Is Cancer of the Testes?
* Which Groups Are at Risk?
* Early Detection
* Actions
* Remember
WHAT IS CANCER OF THE TESTES?
It is a rare kind of cancer in men.
It can occur at any age but is more common in young men, 20 to 40 years old.
Often only one testis is affected.
The cause of testicular cancer is unknown.
It affects men at the time they are most concerned about sexual fertility and starting a family.
Testicular cancer accounted for 0.75% to 1.46% of all cancers in men reported to the Cancer Registry during 1996 and 1997.
WHICH GROUPS ARE AT RISK?
* Males with a history of undescended testicles (corrected or uncorrected).
The risk increases up to 11-fold.
All infant boys should be checked at birth for undescended testicles.
* Men with a family history of testicular cancer.
* Men with an infertility problem.
EARLY DETECTION
The individual himself detects most abnormalities in the testis.
The best way to find abnormalities is through testicular self-examination.
Testicular Self-Examination (TSE)
TSE is best performed after washing with warm water, a warm bath or shower.
Heat relaxes the scrotum, making it easier to detect any abnormalities.
If you are 18 years and older, follow these steps every month:
* Check for any swelling on the scrotum (a mirror may be of assistance)
* Examine each testicle with both hands.
Place the index finger and middle finders under the testicle with the thumbs placed on top.
Cancerous lumps usually are found on the sides of the testicle, but can also be present in the middle of front of the testis.
* Find the soft tube-like structure behind the testicles.
This is called the epididymis, which collects and carries sperm.
Familiarise yourself with this structure.
Do not mistake it for a suspicious lump.
Look for the following:
* a small (pea-sized), painless lump in a testicle (note: not all lumps are cancerous)
* an enlarged testicle
* a feeling of heaviness in the testicle or groin
* a change in the way the testicle feels
* enlarged breasts and nipples
* fluid that suddenly accumulates in the scrotum
* pain in the testicle.
ACTIONS
If you have sever testicular pain - get emergency care.
If any lumps, enlargement, swelling or change in texture can be felt in the scrotum - see a doctor.
If there is a sense of heaviness or pain - see a doctor.
If there is an enlargement of the breasts and nipples and/or a sudden feeling of puffiness in the scrotum - see a doctor.
If no abnormalities are found - continue with TSE until 40/45 years of age.
Cancer of the testicle is highly curable, especially when detected and treated early.
Removal of one testicle does not impair fertility or sexual function.

Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Courts & Legal Services > Community Courts
Government has opened three Community Courts in Cape Town, Mitchell's Plain and Fezeka (Gugulethu/Mannenberg) to prosecute petty crimes in these areas.
The following actions are crimes on the streets of the City of Cape Town, in terms of Provincial Notices 562/1987 and 271/1995, and people who are arrested for these reasons will be sent to the Community Courts:
* drinking in public
* obstructing the free movement of pedestrians or traffic after being warned not to do so
* urinating or defecating in public or on the street
* littering
* fighting in the street
* swearing in the street
* shouting, screaming or causing unnecessary noise in the steet
* trespassing
* gambling in the street
* engaging in prostitution on the street.
Other petty offences or offences in terms of other by-laws, can also be sent to the Community Courts.
If a person is arrested in the afternoon or evening of a weekday they will spend the night in the police station cell.
The following morning they will be sent to the cells at the Community Court, where they will be assessed and processed, if possible on the same day; the aim is for those arrested to spend only one night in cells.
There are no postponements of cases.
Most cases are dealt with by the Community Courts within 36 hours of the person's arrest.
However, if a person is arrested on a Friday or on the weekend they will have to wait until Monday morning to be transferred to the Community Court.
Social workers, representatives of non-government organisations such as NICRO, and lawyers from the Legal Aid Board and university law clinics are on permanent standby at the Community Courts.
Community Courts are part of the strategy to prevent major crime by dealing effectively with minor crimes.
They will also help relieve the caseload of the Magistrates' Courts.
Community Courts are aimed at the rehabilitation of offenders; most sentences imposed by the Community Courts involve a fine, community service, or a suspended sentence, depending on the assessment of the person arrested.

Disabled Parking Discs
If you have a disability, you can apply for a disabled parking disc from the municipality.
This disc allows you to park in allocated disability parking bays and exempts you from parking provisions in certain circumstances.
To qualify for a disabled parking disc you need to have a letter from your doctor confirming that:
* your mobility is severely impaired by an ongoing mental or physical condition, or
* your mobility is temporarily but severely impaired.
Certain local authorities require the doctor to complete a section of the form, so the form needs to be collected beforehand.
Please contact your local traffic department to confirm whether you require a doctor's letter or a form.
If you receive a disabled parking disc, you need to display the disc clearly in your windscreen.
Please note that the disabled parking disc issued by any local authority may not automatically be recognised by any other local authority.
To apply for the disc, you need to submit the completed form along with:
* the doctor's letter
* two ID photographs
* the prescribed fee
The fee charged for a disabled parking disc varies from municipality to municipality.

Contacting your Community Police Forum
A Community Police Forum (CPF) consists of organisations and institutions such as schools, ratepayers associations, civic organisations, businesses and religious institutions, working in partnership with the local police.
The purpose of a CPF is to create and maintain a safe and secure environment for citizens living in the CPF's area.
The CPF develops yearly community safety plans, which identify priorities and needs for the area.
These priorities and needs are set by the community, through the CPF, and form part of the local police station's operational plan.
A CPF may also plan and implement its own safety projects, and can apply to the provincial government for funding for these projects.
Station Commissioners of local police stations are responsible for establishing CPFs in their areas.
Almost all police station areas in the Western Cape have a CPF.
Each CPF has its own constitution (based on a uniform constitution) and aims, and may also have Sub-Forums with specific aims.
An Executive Committee of the CPF has to be elected regularly.
The Station Commissioner must always be a member of the Executive Committee, but neither the chairperson nor deputy-chairperson may be police.
You can contact your CPF by contacting your local police station.
You can check whether your police station has a CPF by checking this list.

Common Myths and Facts about Sheriffs
AUTHOR: South African Board for Sheriffs
This brochure unpacks some of the common myths about sheriffs and explains exactly who the sheriff is and what powers they have.
Sheriffs are the bearers of bad news who should be avoided at all costs
Sheriffs are unbiased officials of the court responsible for the serving of all court documents including summonses, notices, warrants, orders and execution of judgements and orders.
A sheriff is the public face of the civil justice system.
Sheriffs can break your door down, damage your property and abuse you.
The South African Board for Sheriffs monitors the service provided by sheriffs and their deputies ensuring it is executed in a humane manner in terms of the Code of Conduct for Sheriffs.
If anyone feels a sheriff has not acted fairly they are encouraged to report the incident to the CEO of the Board.
Once a sheriff arrives at your door there is nothing you can do to fix the situation.
On arrival, sheriffs will explain the contents of the document they are serving and what you need to do next.
They are there to help explain the legal process but cannot give you legal advice.
There is no way of knowing if the person at your door is a genuine sheriff or a debt collector.
Every sheriff and deputy sheriff must be able to produce a valid identification card issued by the South Africa Board for Sheriffs.
Sheriffs only represent big business.
They are not there for the ordinary man in the street.
It is the duty of sheriffs to serve all people, rich and poor, with empathy and dignity at all times.
Sheriffs are self-appointed and do as they please.
Sheriffs are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development and act under riles of, and orders from, the Court.
Sheriffs should be chased away with stones and any documents served can be ignored or thrown away.
If you interfere with a sheriff performing their duty or do not follow instructions given to you by the sheriff, you may be liable for prosecution.
The sheriff can do nothing, if you refuse to cooperate.
In terms of the law, a sheriff can enter your premises and open your house, even when you are not there.
They can attach remove and sell your vehicle, furniture and other moveable property, or if necessary our immoveable property to recover your debt.
Sheriffs can take anything they want from your home.
Sheriffs must explain the contents of the document they are serving and may not attached and remove necessary items such as food and beds, bedding and clothes.
Furthermore, they may not, subject to certain guidelines, remove all your tools that you may rely on to earn a living.
Sheriffs can demand money and don't have to issue a receipt.
Sheriffs are supposed to issue receipts for any monies pad and to make sure both the original and copies of documents are marked with any payment made and acknowledged with your signature or mark.
You are entitled to keep a copy of the original document.

Contacting, Registering or Getting Training and Equipment for your Neighbourhood Watch
A neighbourhood watch is a group of citizens from a neighbourhood who agree to form a neighbourhood watch after discussing the idea with people who live in their area.
The aim of a neighbourhood watch is to encourage good relations among residents and to serve as a "watchdog" for that community, sometimes by patrolling, and sometimes by simply being alert to criminal activity and notifying the police when it occurs.
The police will try to assign police reservists to supervise patrols whenever neighbourhood watches do patrol.
Some neighbourhood watch members may become police reservists.
Each neighbourhood watch has an area with clear boundaries, within a police area.
There can be more than one neighbourhood watch in an area covered by one police station, as police station areas are very large.
Your neighbourhood watch should register with the local police and Community Police Forum (CPF) in your police area.
To register you must adopt a constitution and code of conduct in line with the Provincial Constitution and Code of Conduct for Neighbourhood Watch Structures.
In early 2003 there were 277 registered neighbourhood watches in the Western Cape.
Once your neighbourhood watch is registered, you can ask for financial and organisational support, as well as equipment and training, from the Western Cape Department of Community Safety.
More than 150 neighbourhood watches in the Western Cape have already received equipment and training from the Department.
The kinds of training you can get from the Department include:
* conflict resolution
* criminal procedure
* domestic violence
* human rights
* fire fighting
* first aid
* radio procedure
* self-defence.
The equipment you can get from the Department includes:
* accident tape
* batons
* first aid kits
* handcuffs
* jackets
* reflective vests
* torches
* traffic cones
* two-way radios
* whistles.

Becoming a Peace Worker
Peace workers patrol the community and are available to help with any unarmed conflict situation.
Other services provided include going to mass events, such as funerals, which may become violent.
Peace workers serve their communities for a year.
Any person between the ages of 18 and 35, who is unemployed, has reached Grade 10 or higher and who does not have a criminal record can apply to become a peace worker.
Peace workers are trained through the Peace and Development Project of the Department of Community Safety, funded by the German government.
Peace workers do NOT get paid.
However, as a peace worker, you will get:
* food parcels per shift on duty
* transport to and from pick-up points for shifts
* an advanced life skills course
* an advanced community peace workers' course
* a first aid course
* bridging courses in Business English, Computers, Mathematics and Career Guidance.
To apply to become a peace worker, you must first make sure you meet the following requirements:
* You must be between 18 and 35 years old.
* You can be male or female.
* You must live in the community you wish to serve.
* You must be unemployed.
* You must not have a criminal record, unless it was related to political activity before 1994.
* You must have a valid identity document.
* You must have a commitment to bringing peace and development to your community.
* You must have a good reputation in the community.
If you meet these requirements, it does not mean you will automatically qualify to become a peace worker.
You will first have to go to an interview, where you will have to show that you want to help combat crime through active community volunteer work.
You must show you have the drive and motivation to brighten your own future.
If you "pass" the interview, then you can become a peace worker.
To arrange an interview, contact the Peace and Development Project:

Protection from Domestic Abuse
If you are the victim of domestic abuse and your abuser is someone with whom you are in a domestic relationship, you may apply for a protection order, in terms of the Domestic Violence Act.
A protection order has conditions, which set out what the abuser may not do.
Should the abuser break these conditions then he can be arrested.
If the abuse involves a criminal offence a charge can be laid for that offence.
The words 'domestic relationship' cover many relationships.
You are in a domestic relationship with someone if you:
* Are or were married to each other, whether you live together or not
* Are same-sex partners, whether you live together or not
* Were or are engaged, dating, or in a customary relationship, or in any relationship you or the other person believes to be romantic
* Have been in a sexual relationship, even for a short time
* Are the parents of a child
* Share or recently shared the same home or residence.
Domestic abuse' includes:
* physical abuse
* sexual abuse
* emotional abuse
* verbal abuse
* psychological abuse
* economic abuse
* intimidation
* stalking
* damage to property
* when you are not living together, entering your property without your permission.
* any other controlling behaviour that may cause harm to your safety, health or well-being.
However, if you are the victim of a type of domestic abuse that is also a crime you can choose to apply for a protection order, or lay a criminal charge, or do both.
Acts of abuse which are also crimes include common assault, assault with the intention of doing grievous bodily harm, indecent assault, rape, incest, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, pointing a firearm, and abuse of animals.
Once you have the protection order, if your abuser breaches (breaks the conditions of) a protection order, then that is a crime and he can be charged with the crime of contempt of court (even if the breaching act is not ordinarily a crime, for example, controlling behaviour).
Having a protection order means having the power to have your abuser arrested as soon as he commits an act of abuse.
All you need to do is report that he has breached the conditions, and the police must act immediately.
Before getting a protection order, you can get an interim protection order quite quickly by filling in certain forms, and that interim order will specify a date at which the final order will be considered (a return date).
Once a final order is made, it is permanent and can only be changed by applying to the courts.
The kinds of protection you can get in a protection order include conditions that:
* Your abuser must not commit any act of domestic abuse.
* Your abuser must pay you rent, mortgage payments or other emergency money.
* The police must seize any firearms or dangerous weapons in your abuser's possession.
* The police must go with you and help you to collect your personal property.
DO I HAVE TO APPLY MYSELF?
CAN I APPLY FOR SOMEONE ELSE?
WHAT INFORMATION DO I NEED?
If it does not appear you might suffer harm, then the police may instead give your abuser a notice to appear in court on a criminal charge of breaching the protection order.

Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Police > Getting Counselling as a Victim of Crime
In the past, a police station was not a place where victims, particularly of violent crimes, could feel comfortable giving their statements to police, nor could they get counselling there for the trauma they were experiencing.
The Department of Community Safety has therefore been funding 'trauma rooms', also known as 'victim comfort rooms', 'victim support rooms' or 'safe rooms' in each police station in the Western Cape.
The room is supposed to be more private than the charge office, and also more comfortably furnished.
The Department of Community Safety has begun the process of training volunteers in batches.
The NGOs, the National Institute for Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO) and the Trauma Centre, are both assisting with training volunteers and setting up the rooms.
At the moment the facilities and the help you can get vary from trauma room to trauma room.
Some of the counsellors or volunteers may also not be there all the time, but are on standby, and have to be telephoned to come and help when necessary.
You can click here to see what help you can get in your police station.
Once you have reported the crime committed against you in the charge office at the closest police station, you should ask to go to the police station's trauma room to give your full statement there, if you are feeling traumatised.

Life Skills Training for Young People
The Chrysalis Academy offers a social crime prevention and upliftment programme targeting "youth at risk".
Its aim is to empower young people to take control of their lives and give them the tools to become economically productive and be positive change agents within their communities.
This metamorphosis will take them, via intense physical, mental and spiritual development away from a life which could turn to crime and gangsterism, to one with potential for personal growth, financial security and community service.
It is a preventative initiative as opposed to a rehabilitation programme.
This means that it is geared to developing young adults with assessed potential for growth, rather than solving or attempting to fix existing problems.
The target population is young people between the ages of 17 and 22 years old who have attained a minimum educational level of Grade 10 (Standard 8), are presently unemployed and have no criminal record.
The programme is currently supported and funded by the Provincial Government.
The Academy is situated on the Porter Estate in Tokai.
Started in June 2000, each programme accommodates between 100 and 120 students from the Western Cape, who have undergone a rigorous selection process.
Participation is entirely voluntary, and free, to all who attend.
The programme is divided into 5 phases:
1. Opportunity
2. Orientation
3. Wilderness
4. Skillsand
5. Community
The Opportunity phase incorporates the marketing of the programme to community organisations and the prospective students.
The remaining 4 phases make up the 12 - week programme.
During each phase the students will be exposed to extensive physical activity and sport, together with different areas of intellectual and social development.
They will acquire skills which can be applied in the job market.
The Orientation phase lays the foundation and establishes a disciplined daily routine where neatness and personal hygiene are emphasised.
This is coupled with goal setting, motivation, problem solving and communication.
The students also cover basic health and nutrition, level one first aid, fire fighting and environmental awareness.
They then spend two weeks in the Wilderness phase at Outward Bound, where personal limits are tested, learning much about their strengths and weaknesses, as well as teamwork and the power of nature.
Abseiling, kayaking, rock climbing and long hikes are featured in this phase.
On returning to Cape Town, the students are allowed visitors for the first time since the start of the course.
By this time all are supremely fit, highly motivated and their self confidence is obvious.
Most of the smokers will have given up the habit by this time.
Under the expert guidance of instructors from Westlake Technical College, students are introduced to the Basic Engineering Skills Training (B.E.S.T) course over the four weeks of the Skills phase.
* Car maintenance
* welding
* brick laying
* metal
* woodwork
* electrical circuitry and other courses, are covered in hands-on classes.
In 2002 security training, tailoring and catering were added to the curriculum.
Sports coaching is introduced during this phase.
The final Community phase is the preparation for life in the real world and focuses on business survival skills, an introduction to computers and career guidance.
A wide variety of socially acceptable activities are also engaged in such as arts and crafts, singing, chess, and reading.
Throughout the programme the students are required to do community work and volunteerism is actively promoted.
Affiliation with a community organisation is encouraged while much emphasis is placed on positive community work like school sports coaching, neighbourhood watch patrolling and improving their quality of life at home through greening projects and other clean-up activities.
The Graduate Affairs department monitors the progress of graduates for five years after the course and ensures that information regarding any volunteer or work opportunities are communicated as an ongoing service to both graduates and stakeholders.
Where 20 or more graduates exist in a particular area, community clubs have been established to assist and support them.
Graduates are in great demand with 67% employed by over 70 businesses throughout the Western Cape.
Unemployed graduates are absorbed into projects such as Swimsafe and Bambanani and many others run by various Government departments and organisations.
The Chrysalis Academy is aimed mainly at young people from disadvantaged communities in the Western Cape between the ages of 17 and 22.
If you who want to join the Chrysalis Academy you should:
* be unemployed
* have a minimum of Grade 10 (Standard 8)
* not have a criminal record
* live in the Western Cape.
However, you can still apply if you don't meet these conditions.
For example, if you have committed crimes or don't have enough education, you can be allowed in if a government department or an NGO refers you to the Chrysalis Academy, after carefully looking at your application.
Also, if you are from outside the Western Cape you can also come to the Academy, but you may have to pay a fee.
To apply to go the Chrysalis Academy, you need to fill in an application form and email or fax it to the Chrysalis Academy on 021 712 1075.

Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Community Policing > Setting up a City Improvement District
A CID makes an agreement with the municipality so that more money (a CID levy) can be collected from ratepayers in the area over and above the normal rates charges.
This extra money is used to give 'top up' services in the area covered by the CID.
The extra services usually include extra security and cleansing.
CIDs have also been called Commercial Improvement Districts (CIDs) or Residential Improvement Districts (RIDs) in the past.
An example of an established City Improvement District is the Cape Town Central City Improvement District.
This CID covers the areas bordered by these roads in central Cape Town: Buitengracht, Buitensingel, Orange, Grey's Pass, Queen Victoria, Wale, Spin, Plein, Roeland, Canterbury, Darling, Castle, Strand, Adderley, Heerengracht, Old Marine, Civic, Hertzog Boulevard, Oswald Pirow and Table Bay Boulevard.
The Cape Town Partnership manages the Cape Town Central CID.
The service contract between the Cape Town Central CID and the City of Cape Town says that the City of Cape Town must provide extra guaranteed services in the Cape Town CID area over and above normal services, in return for the CID levy.
The CID levy is a dedicated levy: the money raised from the levy must go to the CID.
This means that the levy must be used for services in terms of the business plan agreed to by property owners in the CID and cannot be redistributed for use outside the CID.
Levies charged to property owners are sometimes paid by property owners, or sometimes passed on to tenants, in the same way that rates are.
There are more Cape Town CIDs in various stages of being established.
These include the Green Point CID, the Oranjekloof CID, the Higgovale CID, the Sea Point CID and the Camps Bay CID, which all fall under the City of Cape Town.
The City of Cape Town drafted a by-law for CIDs in 2003, which is in the process of being passed.
This by-law gives the procedure that must be followed for establishing a CID in the City of Cape Town.
Any owner of property that pays rates in the City of Cape Town area can apply to the Cape Town Council for a CID to be approved.
The person making the application must pay all costs involved in the application process.
The management body of the CID eventually created can reimburse some of these costs to the applicant if the application is successful.
The process involves advertising for a public meeting to be held, the holding of a public meeting to discuss the CID, submitting a written application which must include an improvement plan, payment of a fee to the Council, advertising the application and considering objections to the application, getting a City Council decision, and getting majority support from ratepayers.
The written application must have the written approval of at least 25% in number of the owners of rateable properties in the area, and these owners must represent 25% of the rates-based value of the properties in the area.
If the Council approves the application, the CID must within six months of approval of the application get the written agreement of property owners in the area that together own at least 50% of all properties in number and at least 50% of the rates base.
Only once this majority agreement has been obtained, can the management body implement the City Improvement District Plan.
The management body must be a non-profit company (established in terms of Section 21 of the Companies Act), which must be created before the implementation of the City Improvement District Plan.
National Government is in the process of drafting a new law called the Local Government Property Rates Bill.
This new law provides for 'special rating areas' (clause 19), and gives guidelines as to how metropolitan municipalities like Cape Town should deal with special rating areas.
CIDs are special rating areas.
Any by-law passed will have to comply with this new law.
There is only one metropolitan municipality in the Western Cape at the moment, being the City of Cape Town.
The Demarcation Board decides which areas are metropolitan municipalities.

NEW FIREARMS LEGISLATION IN EFFECT FROM 1 JULY 2004
On 1 July 2004, new firearms controls entered into effect.
The legislation governing the licencing of firearms is the Firearms Control Act.
This law requires people who apply for firearm licences to undergo a competency test.
There is a period between 2004 and Dec 2006 during which existing firearms owners will be able to renew their licences.
In terms of the Act, people who apply for firearm licences will have to undergo a competency test before being able to apply for a firearm licence.
SAPS will issue competency certificates to successful applicants, who will then be entitled to own firearms.
HOW TO APPLY FOR A LICENCE
In order to get a licence for a firearm, you must:
* Get a competency certificate
* Apply for a licence
The competency certificate is a new aspect of firearms licencing in South Africa.
To get the certificate, the applicant must:
* Be 21 years old
* Pass a thorough background check
* Not have a criminal record for a variety of crimes
* Know the law
* Know how to use a firearm (you must have completed a basic training course at an accredited training institution).
The certificate is valid for five years and must be valid at the time of applying for the licence.
The police or a court can declare you unfit to carry a firearm.
This declaration lasts for five years.
To apply for the competency certificate you need to complete the application form (SAPS 517) and submit it to the Designated Firearms Officer (DFO) at your nearest police station.
SAPS have prepared detailed instructions on how to complete the application form for a competency certificate.
If you have a valid competency certificate, you can then apply for a firearms licence.
To apply for the licence you need to:
* Submit an application form (Form SAP 271) at the police station nearest to your home and pay a prescribed fee by affixing a revenue stamp to the application form.
SAPS have prepared detailed instructions on completing the form.
* Sign a form indicating that you are aware of the law applicable to firearm owners.
* Make a declaration regarding any previous convictions you may have.
* Have your fingerprints taken.
Only very small or satellite police stations do not have a DFO.
Even if a station does not have a DFO, there will be someone at the police station who will help you.
The DFO will help you with completing the form and interview you.
Some DFOs require applicants to make a prior appointment.
When you have submitted the application, the DFO will issue you a confirmation of receipt certificate and then process your application.
The DFO will also check for a criminal record or a record of domestic violence, and whether you already have a firearm licence.
Having carried out all the checks, the DFO will forward the application form and supporting documentation to the Central Firearms Register (CFR) in Pretoria, along with a recommendation on whether or not a licence should be granted.
The CFR then makes the final decision.
The entire process usually takes about two months, if there are no problems with the application.
Should a licence be refused, you may file an appeal.
HOW LONG IS THE LICENCE VALID FOR?
All firearms licences must be renewed every:
* Two years for business purposes
* Five years for self-defence
* Ten years for hunting or sports shooting
HOW MANY FIREARMS CAN ONE PERSON OWN?
The law limits the number of guns for which you can get a licence, depending on your needs:
* One gun for self-defence
* Up to four firearms for occasional hunters or sportsshooters (but only one handgun)
* No limit for dedicated hunters and sports shooters, but you must prove that you are a member of a hunting or sports organisation and must show a need for additional firearms
* No limit for people who use firearms for business purposes (eg security companies, firearm instructors, game hunters) but there strict conditions apply.
WHAT IF I HAVE AN EXISTING LICENCE?
If you have a firearm that was licensed in terms of the old legislation and the licence was valid on 30 June 2004, this licence is still valid until it is renewed in terms of the new Firearms Control Act.
There is a schedule setting out when you need to renew the licence by.
The schedule is linked to your date of birth.
Date of Birth
Year for Licence Renewal
31 December to 31 March
1 April to 30 June
1 July to 30 September
1 October to 31 December
If you submitted an application for a licence before 30 June 2004, this application will still be processed.
WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF I OWN OR WANT TO OWN A GUN?
You must get basic training from an accredited trainer.
All accredited trainers are issued with compentency certificates from SAPS.
You can only buy a firearm from a registered dealer.
If your firearm is lost or stolen, or our documents are damaged, you need to report this to the police.
You may only own 200 rounds of ammunition for each gun you own and can only have ammunition that is suitable for that particular gun. (This does not apply to dedicated hunters or sports people.)
If you need further information you can contact the appointed Designated Firearms Officer at your nearest police station.
Or you can call the firearms call centre during office hours at 012 353 6111 or e-mail firearms@saps.org.za.
You can also visit the SAPS website for all legislation, instructions and forms relating to firearms licences.

Municipal Courts
Municipal Courts deal mainly with the prosecution of traffic offences, and offences in terms of municipal by-laws, such as those for:
* zoning and building
* water pollution
* waste management
* air pollution
* fireworks
* informal trading
* parking.
You can browse some of the City of Cape Town by-laws here.
Municipal Courts also deal with matters referred from the South African Police Service (SAPS) that involve traffic offences.
There are ten Municipal Courts within the City of Cape Town area.
You should be able to pay a traffic fine from anywhere in the City of Cape Town at any of these Municipal Courts.
Most Municipal Courts are housed within the Magistrates' Court in that area.
The National Department of Justice provides the magistrates for the Municipal Court.
The City of Cape Town provides the prosecutors, venues and administration. (The Director of Public Prosecutions has given city council officials authority to prosecute on municipal by-law matters.
The Director has the power to delegate authority to any official, or to any employee, the power to prosecute.)
If you would like to pay a traffic fine, go to the enquiries desk at your nearest Municipal Court.
They will send you to the relevant person who deals with the area in which your traffic offence occurred.
You can then pay the fine at the cash office.
Please note that the enquiries office closes at 3.00pm and the cash office at 3.30pm.
If you have been summonsed to appear in a Municipal Court, the relevant Court will be indicated on your summons, as well as the time and date that you should appear.
Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Police > Becoming a Police Reservist
Becoming a Police Reservist
To be a police reservist you must not have a criminal record, and you must at least have passed matric.
Go to your nearest police station and ask to speak to the reservist coordinator.
You will have to fill in a number of application forms, and have your fingerprints taken.
The application forms will be processed and considered by a selection committee.
You will also have to appear before the selection committee.
If you comply with all the criteria and the selection committee decides to accept your application, you will then be trained in police work, including firearms training, over a period of six months.
Once you have completed all the training successfully, you'll receive a certificate of appointment and a uniform.
You'll also be issued with a firearm that you may use while on duty; it remains with the police when you are off duty.
You will not be issued with a firearm if you fail the firearms training.
Your shifts will be determined by the station commander according to the crime trends in the area and the times when you are available.
Reservists are volunteers who wish to serve the community and do not get paid for their work on duty.
However, they have the same powers and duties as any police officer while they are on duty.

Reporting Rape
If you have been raped or sexually assaulted, you can report this to the police.
It is your choice whether to report, but if you do not report then your case will not be investigated or prosecuted.
Police are not allowed to refuse to investigate your case if you report it.
However, if there is too little evidence after an investigation by the police, a prosecutor may decide not to prosecute your case.
There is no time limit for reporting a rape case, while other sexual offences have a 20-year time limit.
However, if you do not report quite soon after the rape happened then physical evidence may be lost and any witnesses may be difficult to find, which will make successful prosecution more difficult.
Also, when you report, the police will take you to hospital where you will be given medication to prevent HIV/Aids.
It is important to take this medication as soon as possible after being raped.
If you are a child, or reporting on behalf of a child, the case is dealt with in a different manner.
* Calling the police
* Making a Statement
* The Medical Examination
* What if the suspect gets bail?
* The Trial
* Support Organisations
CALL THE POLICE
You can report rape by going to the closest police station.
You can also report rape by telephoning the closest police station.
If you report by phone, the police will send a police van to fetch you.
However, because the police van may not be available immediately, you may have to wait a long time to be fetched.
If you are badly hurt, you should call an ambulance directly or the emergency number instead.
Usually, you are supposed to report rape at the police station closest to where the rape happened (which might be far away from where you live).
However, if you have gone to another police station, the police are not allowed to send you away.
They must do the first steps of the investigation, including opening a case docket and the medical examination, and give the case to the correct police station afterwards.
At the police station, you can ask to speak to a woman police official.
However, a woman may not always be available.
You do not have to give all the details of what happened in the charge office when reporting the rape.
After you have said that you want to report a rape, you should be taken to a private space such as an office, or to the trauma room, which is a more comfortable room that often also has trained volunteers to help you.
Most police stations have trauma rooms that are supposed to be open all the time, even on weekends and at night.
MAKING A STATEMENT
You need only give a brief statement of what happened and have the rape recorded in the occurrence book (a book in which all crimes are recorded) at the police station, before being taken to have a medical examination.
You should try to give a detailed description of the rapist and where you last saw him immediately so that the police can try to arrest him as soon as possible.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION
A state doctor (the District Surgeon) will do the medical examination, usually at a hospital.
You can get a private doctor to do the examination, but they are often not trained in collecting forensic evidence and may not have the time to go to court.
The doctor must also give you medication to prevent HIV/Aids.
Because the aim of the medical examination is to collect forensic evidence, you should not wash before the medical examination, as this may wash away evidence.
You should also bring the clothes you were wearing at the time of the rape so that they can also be examined for evidence.
If the police arrest a suspect, they may need to hold an identity parade where you will have to point out the rapist if he is one of the people in the identity parade.
If the police station has a two-way mirror, then this will be used for the identity parade.
You do not need to touch the suspect and you should refuse to do so if anyone asks you to.
When you give your statement, you should give as much detail as possible about what happened, especially on whether the rapist threatened you and whether he was violent.
Make sure the police know if you think he knows where you live and if you are afraid he might intimidate you.
This is important information that will help the court decide whether he should be granted bail or not, once he is arrested.
WHAT IF THE SUSPECT GETS BAIL?
If the rapist is granted bail, the police must inform you, including the conditions of his bail.
One of the conditions of bail is always that he will not be allowed to talk to you or threaten you in any way.
If he does talk to you or if he breaks any of the other conditions, you must contact the detective dealing with your case immediately and make a statement about this.
THE TRIAL
Unfortunately, it may take a very long time for your case to go to court for trial, and if the police cannot find enough evidence, the prosecutor may decide not to prosecute.
If you have any complaints about how the police have dealt with your case, you should lodge a complaint.
You can get help from any of the organisations that help survivors of sexual violence with preparing for the trial and with any other problems you may be experiencing.
On the day of trial, try to arrange with the prosecutor beforehand that you will arrive early and have a separate place to sit while waiting for the trial to start, as it is common for the rapist and his supporters to make comments about you within earshot and try to intimidate you in other ways.
Some courts have separate witness waiting rooms that you can use instead of waiting in the corridor with the rapist and his supporters.
If the court does not have a witness waiting room, ask the prosecutor to make another office available for you.

Removal of a Firearm
The South African Police Service (SAPS) may remove a firearm under certain circumstances:
* If someone is in possession of a firearm without a licence, the SAPS may remove the firearm and bring a criminal charge against the person.
* If someone has a licence for a firearm but poses a danger, the SAPS can declare the person unfit to possess a firearm.
* Someone convicted of certain offences is deemed to be unfit to possess a firearm, and may not keep a firearm.
* Illegal possessors of firearms
* Licensed firearm owners
* Persons convicted of other offences
ILLEGAL POSSESSORS OF FIREARMS
Anyone who has a firearm without a licence is committing an offence.
If you report that offence to the SAPS, they can then search for and seize the firearm without a warrant.
Make a statement to the SAPS at a police station stating how you know that someone has a firearm without a licence.
Ask the SAPS to open a docket and investigate the matter.
The SAPS will seize the firearm and a criminal case will follow.
LICENSED FIREARM OWNERSLICENSED FIREARM OWNERS</div
If you believe a licensed firearm owner is dangerous and unfit to possess a firearm, make a statement about that at a police station.
Ask the Designated Firearms Officer (DFO) to hold a "Section 11 hearing" to declare the person unfit to possess a firearm.
The SAPS can hold this hearing if the firearm owner:
* Has said they would kill or injure themselves or any other person with their firearm.
* Has a mental condition, tends to be violent, or has a dependence on alcohol or drugs.
* Has failed to look after the firearm properly to ensure no-one else uses it.
The SAPS will deliver a notice in writing to the person, telling them to appear for a hearing.
The SAPS may issue a warrant for the search and seizure of the firearm at the same time.
The hearing is usually run by a superintendent of the SAPS or someone of higher rank.
The person can be represented by an attorney at the hearing, and may call witnesses and cross-examine them, including the person who made the statement against them.
If the person is found to be unfit to possess a firearm, all their firearms and licences must be surrendered to the SAPS.
A declaration of unfitness is usually for a period of not less than two years.
The Western Cape SAPS processes more successful Section 11 hearings than any other province of South Africa.
In terms of the Arms and Ammunition Act of 1969, people convicted of the following crimes are automatically deemed to be unfit to possess a firearm:
* possessing a firearm without a licence
* pointing a firearm at another person
* failing to lock away a firearm properly
* negligent loss of a firearm, including theft as a result of failure to lock it away properly
* unlawful firing of a firearm endangering another person or their property, or negligent handling of a firearm
* any offence in which a firearm was used (unless the person paid an admission of guilt fine).
Anyone convicted of these offences must surrender their firearm to the SAPS.
If you know someone that has a gun and is guilty of a firearms-related offence, make a statement at a police station about that.
Ask the DFO to ensure the person surrenders the firearm.
PERSONS CONVICTED OF OTHER OFFENCES
Courts have the discretion to declare someone unfit to possess a firearm if they are convicted, particularly on offences involving violence.
If you are a victim of an offence involving violence, it's worth asking the prosecutor in the matter to ask the court for a declaration of unfitness.
The prosecutor should do this after the person has been convicted and while sentencing is being decided.
People convicted of the following crimes may be declared unfit to possess a firearm: high treason; sedition; terrorism; subversion; sabotage; public violence; intimidation; murder; malicious injury to property; rape; assault; robbery; theft of game; breaking or entering any premises, whether under the common law or a statutory provision, with the intent to commit an offence; kidnapping; child stealing; culpable homicide; or any conspiracy, incitement or attempt to commit any offence already referred to above.

Reporting a Crime
To report a crime that has already happened, you should telephone or visit your nearest police station.
To report rape or child abuse there are special considerations that apply.
In an emergency you should call the emergency police telephone number 10111 or 112.
Once you have reported the crime, you should receive a case number and you should be given the name of the detective who will be investigating your case.
If you are traumatised you can get help for that and if you need witness protection that is also available.
If you feel a firearm needs to be removed from a dangerous person you must ask for that.
If you need a protection order for domestic violence you can also begin that process at the police station.
* Reporting a Missing Person (Service)
Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Courts & Legal Services > Getting Witness Protection
Getting Witness Protection
You can be afraid of a single person or of a group of people.
Anyone who is a member of your household or family, or who is close to you in any way, can apply for protection for you if you are unable to do so.
You can apply for a child without the child's guardian's (parent or other person responsible for the child) permission if:
* The guardian is a suspect in the case that the child is a witness to, or
* If the child has no guardian, or
* If the guardian cannot be found, or
* If it can be shown the guardian is refusing to give permission unreasonably.
You are a witness if you are giving evidence (testifying in court or making an affidavit) right now, or if you may have to give evidence in the future, or if you have given evidence in the past.
This evidence can be in a serious criminal case, an inquest, a commission or a tribunal, an investigation by the Independent Complaints Directorate or an asset forfeiture case.
You or anyone else threatened will be removed from the dangerous situation as soon as possible.
You will be placed into temporary witness protection, after which your application for permanent protection will be considered.
If your application is approved then you will be placed in permanent witness protection.
You must be a witness, or applying on behalf of someone who is a witness, to ask for witness protection.
You must report your fears, the reason for your fears and that you want to apply for witness protection to any of the following people, who will help you to make an application:
* The investigating officer (detective) who is investigating the case in which you are a witness.
* The station commander or anyone who is in charge at any police station .
* If you are in prison, the person in charge of the prison or a registered social worker at the prison.
* The public prosecutor in the case in which you are giving evidence, or the Director of Public Prosecutions (formerly known as the Attorney-General) for that area.
* Any member of the Witness Protection Unit.
The person you have reported to will arrange for removal as soon as possible if you are in immediate danger.
You will have to fill in an application form after being removed from the dangerous situation.
The Director of the Witness Protection Unit will be told within 48 hours that you have been removed to temporary protection.
You will be kept in temporary protection for no longer than two weeks.
During this time a witness protection officer will investigate your application, which includes a risk assessment and an evaluation of you by a psychologist.
The officer will report to the Director, who will then decide whether to extend the temporary protection, place you in permanent protection, or refuse the application.
The Director might refuse the application if they think that other ways of protecting you are better than placing you in the permanent protection programme.
If the Director decides permanent protection is best, you will have to sign a protection agreement.
In this agreement you agree to abide by all the rules of the protection programme, which generally involve not revealing information about the programme, as well as any particular conditions that might have to apply for your case.
You will not be placed in permanent protection unless you sign this agreement.
The agreement is set up to ensure your own safety as well as the safety of the witness protection officers and everyone related to the programme.
All witnesses who have kept to the rules of their protection agreement have remained safe.
Permanent protection does not mean you will be in the protection programme for the rest of your life.
Permanent protection lasts as long as the threat against you lasts, plus a phasing out period of six weeks, followed by a discharge.
Discharge may involve a new identity being created for you and you may be relocated.
Permanent protection, which continues until you are discharged, includes the following:
* You and your extended family, where necessary, will be placed in a safe house which is furnished and self-catering (you do not have to pay for this accommodation).
* You will be relocated away from the area where you usually live if that is considered necessary.
* A clinical psychologist will do a trauma and psychological assessment and help you with any trauma you might be experiencing.
* You will undergo an induction programme so that you will know what to expect.
* If you are unemployed, you will get an allowance for your basic needs.
* If you are employed, you will get a replacement salary.
* If your children are with you, arrangements will be made so that they can go to school.
* Some other costs will also be covered, such as your schooling, transport, clothing and medical costs.
You can be removed from the protection programme if it is found that you have broken any of the rules, or it is found that you are abusing the programme in any way.
The programme does not tolerate 'information peddlers', people who pretend to be witnesses so they can go on the programme.
The Witness Protection Unit now also provides 'after-care' to help you to adjust after you leave permanent protection (that is, when you are discharged).
During the phasing-out period, another risk assessment will be done.
Discharge from permanent protection will probably involve changing your identity.
You will be helped to re-integrate into society.
You may also have to relocate permanently away from where you used to live.
As an example of how this can be done, if you own an RDP house in one area, this can be swapped with an RDP house in another area.
Everything to do with witness protection is done in terms of the Witness Protection Act 112 of 1998.
There are nine regional offices of the Witness Protection Unit, one in each of the provinces.
However, their exact location is not made public.
If you have any queries that you want to direct to the Witness Protection Unit itself, you should contact the Head Office of the Witness Protection Unit, which is in Pretoria and forms part of the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the prosecuting authority in South Africa.

Getting Legal Aid
You will have to pass a 'means test', which means you have to show that you earn less than an amount fixed by the Legal Aid Board.
This amount varies if you are single or married and also changes with time.
You also have to show that you don't have any other 'liquid assets', such as money in a savings account, which could be used to pay for your legal fees.
You can also only get legal aid for certain types of cases.
You CANNOT get legal aid:
* For a criminal case if you are going to plead guilty.
* For traffic offences, including drunk driving cases.
* For commercial crime charges such as fraud.
* For drug dealing charges.
* On your third or more criminal charge for the same kind of offence.
* On a case where you have failed to pay a debt in instalments as ordered by the court.
* On a case where your estate is going to be administered because you can't pay your debts.
* If you are suing the Legal Aid Board itself for malpractice.
* For a maintenance matter that can be decided by a maintenance officer.
* Where you are applying to become insolvent (bankrupt) or have your estate administered.
* Where you are suing for money (damages) for relationship-related claims such as defamation, breach of promise to marry, infringement of dignity or privacy, seduction, adultery, and alienation of affection (where you want to sue someone who has caused the person to whom you were engaged to break off the engagement).
You can get legal aid for divorce cases, but NOT if:
* There is a reasonable possibility that you might get together with your spouse again.
* The director of the Board believes there hasn't been enough of an attempt by you and your spouse to come to an agreement.
* You used legal aid before to sue for divorce but then decided not to go ahead with the divorce.
* There are no children involved in the divorce.
You can get legal aid for a labour matter:
* If you are claiming unfair dismissal (you have been fired unfairly), as long as your claim is made within the time limits set by the Labour Relations Act.
* To demand a merit report.
However, legal aid will be refused if there are good reasons to believe you are not taking up a job on purpose or that you resigned from a job in order to be granted legal aid.
You can also get legal aid for appeals on all these types of cases listed, whether criminal or civil (cases where you are suing or being sued).
For appeals, the director of the Board must also believe that you have a reasonable chance of success.
Go to a Legal Aid Board Branch Office or, if there is not one in your area, to the nearest magistrates' court to enquire about legal aid.
All magistrates' courts have a legal aid officer who will help you with your legal aid enquiries.
Attorneys do have a right to refuse a legal aid instruction, but they normally do not refuse.
If they do refuse, a legal aid instruction can be made out to another attorney.
Please note that the Legal Aid Board is not a free legal advice service.
It provides financial support for legal matters to the very poor who cannot afford legal fees.
However, you can get legal advice and help from law clinics attached to universities, and very often these clinics also take legal aid instructions from the Legal Aid Board.
In Stellenbosch, the two organisations are in the same building.

ABOUT
DEDICATED TO ALL THOSE WHO MADE DEMOCRACY A REALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Cape Gateway is a government service aimed primarily at citizens of the Western Cape, providing information on local, provincial and national government.
An initiative of the Provincial Government of the Western Cape (PGWC), in partnership with national and local governments, it gives easy access to government information and services.
Up to now, to get information and services, citizens have had to know which government body provides them.
With Cape Gateway, information is presented from a user's perspective.
There are three ways to access the information Cape Gateway offers:
* the website - www.capegateway.gov.za (you're surfing it right now)
* the contact centre - 0860 142 142 (weekdays 8:00 - 16:00; cost of a local telephone call from anywhere in South Africa)
* the walk-in centre - 142 Long Street, Cape Town (weekdays 8:00 - 16:00; speak with someone face-to-face)
These three channels aim to make the Cape Gateway service accessible to the widest possible audience.
This is also addressed by providing access to the information in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa (the official languages of the Western Cape).
One of the aims of the South African Constitution is to establish an open democracy, characterised by transparency and accountability.
Rights to access information are included as basic human rights.
The Constitution places an obligation on organs of state to disseminate information held by the state as widely as possible: "Transparency must be fostered by providing the public with timely, accessible and accurate information."
Section 195(g)
Batho Pele (People First) is the South African government's initiative to improve the delivery of public services.
Improving service delivery is one of the government's eight priorities as set out in the White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service (pdf, html)
Cape Gateway is a concrete response to these principles and policies.
THE FUTURE
Cape Gateway will continue to update, translate and collect more government information pertinent to the Western Cape, and make it available in a manner that is easily accessible.
Future versions will include online services and transactions with government.
You can participate by making requests for information, or any other suggestions for this service to: questions@capegateway.gov.za

The purpose of the South African Services website is to provide a single source of information about services offered by the South African government.
The objective is to reduce the disparity that exists between the empowered and the disempowered, the first and second economies.

Apply for adoption of a foster child
Adoption means accepting legal guardianship of a child of other biological parents, in accordance with formal legal procedures.
A foster child is a child who has been removed from his or her parents and legally placed in the care of foster parents or a foster home.
The child may be adopted by:
a husband and his wife jointly;
a widower or widow;
unmarried or divorced person;
a married person whose spouse is the parent of the child; or
the natural father of a child born out of wedlock.
The person or persons who are qualified to adopt a child must meet the following requirements:
In the case of a child born of a South African citizen, the applicants must also be South African citizens and thus be resident in the Republic.
If the applicants are not South African citizens, they must qualify for citizenship or must have already made an application for citizenship.
So-called secret adoptions, where the parents of the child are not allowed to know who the prospective adoptive parents are, nor where the child's destination is to be after the adoption, are regulated by section 18 and can only take place if the children's court is satisfied that this will serve the child's best interests.
Children are also placed in foster care, a children's home, a school of industry or place of safety by the Magistrate of a children's court, if they have been declared by the Children's Courts as children in need of care and protection.
However, the child or children can be placed back into the care of a parent, care-giver or guardian where they will be supervised by a social worker.
In this case, the Department of Social Development pays a foster care grant to the foster parents.
The proposed adoption must serve the best interest and conduce to the welfare of the child.
For more information go to the Department of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.
Apply for the adoption with the clerk of the children's court in the district where the child lives.
Complete Form 11: Application for the adoption of a child in respect of each child you wish to adopt.
Submit the form together with:
A certified copy of the identity document of each applicant and the original birth certificate or the original identity document of each child who stands to be adopted

Where applicable, written consent of the parent in the form of Form 12: Consent by parent or guardian to tie adoption of a child and of the child in the form of Form 13: Consent by child to adoption
Consent to the adoption must be obtained from:
The mother of an illegitimate child
The child himself must also consent to the adoption where he is over 10 years of age, and the court must be satisfied that the child understands the nature and import of such consent.
The foster parent where the child is in foster care and the foster parent has not himself made application for the adoption.
The foster parent's consent is not necessary if he refuses or fails to indicate, in writing, whether he gives his consent within one month of being asked to do so by an assistant of the children's court.
No consent is required under the following circumstances:
in the case of any child whose parents are dead and for whom no guardian has been appointed; or
from any parent-
who is as a result of mental illness incompetent to give any consent;
who has assaulted or ill-treated the child or allowed him to be assaulted or ill-treated; or
who has caused or conduced to the seduction, abduction or prostitution of the child or the commission by the child of immoral acts; or
whose child is by virtue of the provisions of section 16 in the custody of a foster parent or is a pupil in a children's home or a school of industries; or
who is withholding his consent unreasonably.

Application for maintenance
Maintenance is the obligation to provide another person, for example a minor, with housing, food, clothing, education and medical care, or with the means that are necessary for providing the person with these essentials.
This legal duty to maintain is called 'the duty to maintain' or 'the duty to support'.
Who must provide maintenance?
The duty to maintain is based on blood relationship, adoption, or the fact that the parties are married to each other.
A child must be supported or maintained by
his or her parents, whether married, living together, separated or divorced, including parents who have adopted the child; and/or
his or her grandparents, whether or not the child's parents were married to each other.
However, this varies from one case to another.
The duty to support a family member is not limited to supporting a child.
Any family member, irrespective of his or her age, can ask any family member to support or maintain him or her, provided that the following two conditions are met:
The family member who claims support is unable to maintain himself or herself.
The family member from whom maintenance is claimed is able to afford the maintenance that is claimed.
What expenses may be claimed?
You may claim reasonable support that is necessary for providing the child or other person who has a right to maintenance with a proper living and upbringing.
This includes providing necessities such as food, clothing and housing, as well as paying for a proper education.
The court may also order the father to contribute to the payment of laying-in expenses and maintenance from the date of the child's birth up to the date on which the maintenance order is granted.
The court may also grant an order for the payment of medical expenses, or may order that the child be registered on the medical scheme of one of the parties as a dependant.
To enable the court to grant a fair maintenance order, both parties must provide the court with proof of their expenses.
Your view of the other parent's behaviour has no effect on your children's right to maintenance.
You still have to pay maintenance, even if the other parent
remarries
is involved in another relationship
does not allow you to see the children or
if either party later has more children.
Your duty to pay maintenance and your right of access to your children are two entirely separate matters and one has no relation to the other.
However, the amount of maintenance to be paid may be amended by the court if either of the parties should bring such an application.
Apply for maintenance at the magistrate's court in the district where you live.
If you are in doubt, your local court will tell you at which court to apply for maintenance.
Go to the relevant court and complete and submit Form A: Application for a maintenance order.
In addition to the completed form, submit proof of your monthly income and expenses, such as receipts for food purchases, electricity and/or rent bill payments.
The court will set a date on which you and the respondent must go to the court.
A maintenance officer and an investigator will investigate your claim and look into your circumstances.
The court will serve a summons on the respondent to appear in court on a specific date to discuss the matter.
The respondent then has a choice between agreeing to pay the maintenance as claimed, or contesting the matter in court.
If the respondent agrees to pay the maintenance as claimed, a magistrate will review the relevant documentation.
He or she will then make an order, and may decide to do so without requiring the parties to appear in court.
If the person who is allegedly liable to pay maintenance does not consent to the issuance of an order, he or she must appear in court, where evidence from both parties and their witnesses will be heard.
If the court finds the person liable for paying maintenance, it will make an order for the amount of maintenance to be paid.
The court will also determine when and how maintenance payments must be made.
The court can order maintenance money to be paid in one of the following ways:
At the local magistrate's office or any other government office designated for this purpose
Into the bank or building society account designated by the person concerned
Directly to the person who is entitled to the money
By means of an order that directs the employer of the person who is liable for paying maintenance to deduct the maintenance payment directly from the employee's salary, in accordance with the new Maintenance Act, 1998.
Maintenance Act, 1998 and related regulations
You will be treated equally, humanely and with dignity.
Complaints will be treated as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
There is no prescribed time frame for this service.
The entire process, from submitting your application to receiving your first maintenance payment, may take several weeks, depending on the cooperation of both parties.
Witnesses who attend the proceedings, including the person who claims maintenance, are entitled to prescribed subsistence and travelling allowances.
However, the court will decide at its own discretion whether such an allowance will be paid to the person against whom a maintenance order may be made.
The person who is claiming maintenance must apply to the maintenance officer for the payment of witness fees.

The Income Tax Act, 1962, provides for circumstances in which an application may be made for a tax directive.
One of these is where a director's expected remuneration for the current year is less than the remuneration received for the previous year and will lead to an overpayment of PAYE, which will result in hardship.
Where the company has not determined the remuneration for the preceding year of assessment, it must request the local branch office of the South African Revenue Service to determine the amount of remuneration which the director is deemed to have received.
The following minimum information must be provided on the application form:
The year of assessment in which the remuneration was received.
The number of completed months for which the last known remuneration was received.
The estimated or actual remuneration for the current year.
The application must contain reasons for the directive.
Support these by documentation, e.g. interim financial statements and minutes of meetings held by directors, which indicate that remuneration to be paid to directors will be less than the remuneration for the previous year of assessment.
There is no specific time-frame for processing the application.

If the mother of the child did not consent to the amendment of the details of her child's registration of birth, the person who wants to acknowledge himself as the father of that child must apply to the relevant children's court for a declaratory order that confirms that he is the father of the child and that the requirement of consent of the mother is unnecessary.

confirmed, in writing, that the father of the child has admitted to being the father of the child and
has made his identity and his whereabouts known.
a social worker submits a report that confirms who and where the father is to the commissioner who has attested the mother's consent, or to the children's court to which the application for the adoption has been made.
This report must be submitted within 60 days after the mother has given her consent, or at any stage before the order of adoption is granted by the children's court.
A parent who has given consent and who wishes to cancel the other parent's consent must inform the commissioner upon attestation of his or her consent.

Consent granted outside South Africa must be signed in the presence of and attested by an officer in the service of a South African diplomatic or consular mission, or by a judge, magistrate, justice of the peace or public officer of the country concerned.
Although the consent should contain the names of the proposed adoptive parents, the children's court may admit consent by the child's parents or guardian which does not contain the names or any other particulars of the proposed adoptive parents if it is satisfied that the best interests of the child will be served thereby.
Withdrawing Consent
Consent must be withdrawn in writing.
Should consent be withdrawn in a district other than the district in which consent was given or in which the application for adoption is to be heard, the commissioner shall immediately o
notify the relevant court and social worker in which court the application for adoption will be heard
notify the commissioner who attested the consent in which court the application for adoption will be heard.
The commissioner shall immediately identify the court in which the application for adoption will be heard and notify both the court and the social worker about the withdrawal.

Crime Stop 08600 10 111
Crime Stop is a range of call centres responsible for collecting information from the public about criminals and their activities.
Members of the public are assisted by call centre staff well-trained in investigative interviewing.
This allows you to inform the South African Police Services about criminal activities in a safe and non-threatening environment.
Selected Crime Stop Call Centres also link up informers directly with investigators through conference calling.
This enables the investigating officer to interview the informer directly.
Note: this is done only with your permission.
You can also report criminal activity electronically through the South African Police Service website which also guarantees anonymity, unless you indicate otherwise.
Dial the Crime Stop number 08600 10 111.
If the information is not yet helpful the agent will explain why and advise you on how to obtain more information.
Usable information is linked with the code number that you have been given.
You will be requested to phone Crime Stop on 08600 10 111 within a given time to establish if the information was positive and if you qualify for a reward.
In future, the agent will only discuss the case with you if the code number you've provided is correct and your identity corresponds with the "profile" on record.
The agent will immediately terminate the call if he or she is not convinced that you are the same person who made the initial call.
This is a protective measure and it is not negotiable.
If you're reporting crime electronically, complete the feedback form on the SAPS website.
A reference number will be displayed once you've submitted the form.

As required by Crime Stoppers' international standards, no number identification or other tracing agents are permitted on Crime Stop premises as it can seriously jeopardise the trusting relationship regarding anonymity between the SAPS and the informer.
Crime Stop will communicate the information given to the relevant investigation unit to follow up, with a request to report initial feedback within 24 hours and the outcome of the investigation as soon as possible.

Getting married under customary law
The Customary Marriages Act became law on the 15 November 2000.
If you were in an existing valid marriage under customary law before this date, your marriage is recognised under this new law.
When a husband already has more than one wife, all of those marriages are recognised under this new law.
This Act also recognises customary marriages entered into after this date and states the rules that the people getting married under customary law must follow in order for their marriage to be recognised.
A customary marriage is recognised if people getting married under customary law have complied with the following requirements:
Both parties to the marriage must be above the age of eighteen years.
Both parties must consent to being married under customary law.
Lobola is not a necessary requirement for the validity of the customary marriage.
Note that these marriages have always been recognized under customary law.
When should I register my marriage?
If you were married under customary law before the 15th November 2000, your marriage has to be registered with the Department of Home Affairs.
If you were married after the law was passed, you should register your marriage within three months after the marriage.
Customary Marriages and Community of Property
All customary marriages entered into after the coming into operation of the Act are in community of property.
This means that the husband and wife have an equal share in the assets, money and property and also means that they share all the debts.
If the parties would like their marriage to be out of community of property they will have to enter into an ante-nuptial contract prior to getting married.
If they want to change after they are already married they will have to apply to the High Court.
Under the Customary Marriages Act the wife has an equal right and status with the husband to decide what happens to the property.
A customary wife now has the capacity to enter into a contract without the assistance of the husband.
What if my husband wants to marry another wife?
The husband must enter into a written agreement / contract which will state what should happen to the property and then the husband must apply to the court to approve the written contract.
The court has to make sure that all the property interests of all wives are protected.
What if we want to enter into a civil marriage after marriage under customary law?
If your husband has no other wives, you can get married under civil law as well as customary law.
However, neither of you will be able to enter into customary marriages with anyone else while you are married to each other under civil law.
Either husband or wife can register the marriage at their nearest Department of Home Affairs.
It is advisable that both spouses go together to register the marriage in order to make the registration go quicker.
However, if the other spouse refuses you can register on your own and bring the necessary proof.
Bring your identity document and complete Form A: Application for registration/enquiry into existence of customary marriage which requires you to state the following information:
ID numbers, names and dates of birth of both the husband and the wife
name of the parents of both the husband and wife and the name of the traditional leader
the details of the lobola/magadi agreement, and
two people who witnessed the marriage
a letter from the traditional leader or an affidavit.
The form must be confirmed and signed before a:
registering officer, or
designated person, who has been designated as such by the Director-General to perform functions in terms of these regulations.
The application must be lodged with a registering officer or designated person who must then give you an acknowledgment of receipt of the application in a form of Form B: Acknowledgement of receipt of application for registration of customary marriage.
The registration officer or designated person will forward the application to the nearest regional or district office of the Department for inclusion in the population register.
The certificate of registration or Form C: Customary marriage certificate will be issued to you.
Keep the certificate in a safe place because it important.
An abridged certificate is issued immediately.
An unabridged certificate takes six to eight weeks.
The registering officer will inform you if he or she refuses to register a customary marriage as contemplated, stating the reasons for the refusal.
The following fees are payable to the Department of Home Affairs:
duplicate customary marriage certificate: R11
search and reproduction of customary marriage register or of any supporting documentation in relation to the register (Provided that if needed for official purposes by a Government institution it is free of charge: R53
furnishing of an extract from the customary marriage register: R53
a fee of R11 is payable by the spouses to a designated person in respect of an application for registration of a customary marriage lodged with the designated person.
For further enquiries on the costs involved, please contact the Home Affairs offices .
