S@@ ti@@ mul@@ ating economic growth through coordinated infrastructure investment and strategic programmes 
A Request for Qu@@ ali@@ fication was issued last week to the Mar@@ ket for a Des@@ ign , Con@@ struc@@ t , F@@ i@@ xed P@@ ric@@ e T@@ ur@@ n@@ key contract . The purpose of this procu@@ rement is to enable the D@@ T@@ P 
In respect of S@@ M@@ M@@ E support , during the trade mission to India in Dec@@ ember 200@@ 5 led by the Premier , contact was established with the National S@@ m@@ all Industri@@ es Corporation L@@ t@@ d in India , 
The improvement in employment figures over the last year , mo@@ re@@ over , is certain@@ ly parti@@ ally at@@ tribu@@ table to the co@@ oper@@ atives initiative , which is already estim@@ ated to have attrac@@ ted close to 3@@ 5 000 individuals , 
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming success in the promotion of co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ ME@@ s means that our resources must be directed to support both co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ ME@@ s at district level . 
in@@ ter alia , a coordinated and effici@@ ently implemented infra@@ structural investment programme , in which both government and the private sector will have major roles to play . 
In this regard I am also pleased to report very satis@@ factory progress over the last year@@ : 
In the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ TE@@ F , r@@ ing@@ -@@ f@@ enced funding will be allocated to departments which have a key role to play in the second economy interventions aimed at job creation , poverty relief and black economic empowerment . These programmes are the following: 
 this strategy in turn is al@@ igned to the national Acc@@ eler@@ ated and Sha@@ red G@@ rowth In@@ iti@@ ative . The ration@@ ale behind this approach is sim@@ ple@@ : 
Em@@ powerment initiatives 
A further 5 high prof@@ ile cases of fraud and corruption involving syn@@ dic@@ ates are under investigation , and we have join@@ ed forces with the Directorate of Special Oper@@ ations and As@@ set For@@ fe@@ it@@ ure Unit in order to secure successful prosecu@@ tions . 
Mr Speaker , in last years address I all@@ u@@ ded to the fact that we will not at@@ tain our objectives in these economic growth and poverty al@@ leviation programmes 
 the Office of the Premier will be responsible for co@@ ordinating the soccer development programme across the departments involved . 
into the second phase of development by establishing secondary and ter@@ tiary co@@ oper@@ atives . E@@ le@@ ven secondary co@@ ops will be se@@ tu@@ p in each of the district municipalities and me@@ tro , 
pre-@@ qualified b@@ id@@ ders that are techn@@ ically , finan@@ cially and legally qualified and meet the empowerment criteria , 
Such practices have to become far more efficient , ensuring that administrative del@@ ays do not place un@@ be@@ ar@@ able cas@@ h@@ flow burden on the S@@ M@@ ME@@ s . 
In terms of employment , according to the St@@ ats SA Labour Force Sur@@ ve@@ y , in 200@@ 4 9@@ 9@@ 3 ,@@ 000 people in the province were unemployed - this dec@@ lined to 9@@ 8@@ 7 ,@@ 000 in 200@@ 5 , 
The re@@ forms in our as@@ set and supply ch@@ ain management systems and policies are proce@@ eding on track and are set to great@@ ly improve effici@@ encies in the way we proc@@ ure and account for goods and services and physical assets . 
The land at L@@ a Mer@@ cy to be sold to the province . 
World Cup stadium development 
The intention is to provide a bri@@ dg@@ ing programme , a one year certificate , a two year diplom@@ a and a three year degree in co@@ oper@@ atives and business management practice . 
Some of the cases are before the courts of law and misconduct enquiries are also being hand@@ led by respective departments . 
Both I@@ th@@ ala and the Provincial Government conc@@ ed@@ e that this demand for finance cannot be met by I@@ th@@ ala alone . 
for emerging contractors aimed at promoting and supporting affir@@ ma@@ ble business and equ@@ ity in the civil and building contrac@@ tor sector . It com@@ prises a six@@ -@@ st@@ aged adv@@ an@@ cement programme with contract value limits determined by experience , training and capacity . 
Gi@@ ven the huge deal flow which the initi@@ al S@@ M@@ M@@ E fund managed by I@@ th@@ ala has already generated , the Head of Treasury was t@@ asked to develop a scheme 
which will then enter into contrac@@ tual agreements with A@@ C@@ SA to manage and operate the air@@ port and with the selected b@@ id@@ der from the private sector to design and construc@@ t the facility . 
amoun@@ ting to appro@@ xim@@ ately R@@ 6@@ b@@ n in 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 , to stimul@@ ate growth in the S@@ M@@ M@@ E sector and to advance black economic empowerment generally . 
P@@ O@@ L@@ IC@@ Y PR@@ I@@ O@@ R@@ I@@ TI@@ E@@ S F@@ O@@ R THE 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F 
The focus will be on dissemination of information and giving guidance to women , youth and the disabled . 
The re@@ location of Durban International Air@@ port when K@@ ing Sha@@ ka International is operational in 200@@ 9 ; and 
Dra@@ ft legislation establishing the D@@ T@@ P has been prepared and will be submitted to this Legisl@@ ature in Mar@@ ch . I appeal to Honourable Members to ensure that this Bill is dealt with within the strict time@@ fr@@ ames we have set ourselves . 
As I mentioned , this year we will also be institu@@ ting a new co-@@ financing model to support the growth of the small business sector in the province . 
An important part of governments infra@@ struc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic investment programme for the medium term is the Ric@@ h@@ ards Bay Industri@@ al Development Z@@ one . 
if economic growth can be step@@ ped up to average 4 ,@@ 5 over the next five years , and 6 from 200@@ 9 to 20@@ 14 , th@@ en@@ : 
to em@@ power them so as to be capable of running viable commercial enterprises . This means that secondary co@@ ops will need to poss@@ ess skills in financial management , 
We are pro@@ pos@@ ing to al@@ locate R@@ 3@@ 1@@ m , R@@ 8@@ 9@@ m and R@@ 1@@ 3@@ 9 ,@@ 5@@ m over the M@@ TE@@ F period as a contribution to the building of soccer stadium infrastructure in the province . 
A special training unit has been created in collaboration with the University of Z@@ ul@@ ul@@ and to train managers and members of co@@ ops and to develop care@@ ers in the field . 
with the main functions of providing support to primary co@@ oper@@ atives , which are by design production units . The intention is to ensure that primary co@@ oper@@ atives get support from secondary and ter@@ tiary co@@ oper@@ atives , 
This funding will be allocated to the Department of Local Government and Tr@@ adi@@ tional Affairs , 
which will together with the Department of S@@ port and Rec@@ re@@ ation play a co@@ ordinating role in assisting the District Municip@@ alities of A@@ maj@@ u@@ ba , U@@ g@@ u , u@@ M@@ gun@@ g@@ und@@ lo@@ v@@ u and u@@ Th@@ un@@ g@@ ulu 
In the area of governance and risk management , quar@@ ter@@ ly sum@@ mary reports on the risk prof@@ ile of departments are now being submitted to Cabinet . 
A contract is being conclu@@ ded with the N@@ S@@ I@@ C team of consult@@ ants , who will be based in the province for 10 weeks , and who will work with a team from Treasury and Economic Development . 
marketing and general business management . For technical skills secondary co@@ ops should be the single point of entry by government departments with the required expertise and for private sector w@@ ishing to do business with this sector . 
The D@@ u@@ be Tr@@ ade@@ Port Section 21 Com@@ p@@ any will have to be conver@@ ted into a stat@@ u@@ tory public entity under the P@@ F@@ M@@ A that is em@@ po@@ wered to establish K@@ ing Sha@@ ka International Air@@ port Special P@@ ur@@ pose Ve@@ hic@@ le , 
Ag@@ ainst this back@@ ground , what are the governments expenditure priorities for the new M@@ TE@@ F budget cycle comm@@ encing in six week@@ s? 
including the provision and lo@@ an of capital equipment , on a day to day basis and are not depend@@ ant on government support perman@@ ently . Support will be given to secondary co@@ ops 
E@@ C@@ O@@ N@@ O@@ M@@ I@@ C S@@ NA@@ PS@@ H@@ O@@ T 
in@@ ter alia through the bargaining mus@@ cle it will acqu@@ ire over the control of resources and markets through the she@@ er scale of its operations , with benefits flow@@ ing to members of the co@@ oper@@ atives . 
The fl@@ ag@@ ship D@@ u@@ be Tr@@ ade@@ Port project incorpor@@ ating a state of the art Air@@ port in K@@ ing Sha@@ ka International has made solid progress and we are on track to achieve our dead@@ line for the project to be operational by 200@@ 9 . 
Our quest to nar@@ row the ga@@ p between the first and second economies will continue to be a central feature of our economic development strategy in the next three years 
the import of equipment and plant to produce a variety of products such as bar@@ bed wire , cer@@ am@@ ic tiles , ag@@ ri@@ -@@ food products , building materials , paper products etc ; 
will deal with each of these three policy priority areas in turn . 
allowing time in the first year of the M@@ TE@@ F for the stakeholders to fin@@ alise the business case , funding model and ownership arrangements . 
I have already indicated that I believe it is important that there should be long term cons@@ is@@ tency in the budget policy framework and direction to achieve maximum impact over time . 
The equipment and professional expertise provided by the N@@ S@@ I@@ C will be used to support the growth and development of small medium and mic@@ r@@ o enterprises in the province , including co@@ oper@@ atives at both the primary and secondary level . 
Co-@@ financing strategy 
The intention 
and an electronic system to perform the acquisition stage of S@@ C@@ M , namely the sour@@ cing of Qu@@ ot@@ ations and T@@ enders this project will both improve effici@@ encies and tur@@ n@@ around times as well as help to elim@@ inate fraud and corruption . 
Our proposal is to set as@@ ide R@@ 20 million , R2@@ 00 million and R1 ,@@ 5 billion over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F years for this project this is over and above the R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m already in this years budget for the Trade Port . 
I have all@@ u@@ ded to the successes already at@@ tained in establishing primary co@@ oper@@ atives around the province in the last year . This year we intend to move the co@@ oper@@ atives programme 
But hope s@@ mil@@ es from the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come Wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing it will be hap@@ pi@@ er ; 
for financing business applications from primary co@@ oper@@ atives will be aug@@ mented by allocations of R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m , R@@ 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ m and R2@@ 1@@ 7@@ m over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F these funds will be managed by the Department of Economic Development . 
In re@@ viewing its policy priorities for the new M@@ TE@@ F period , the Government of KwaZulu-Natal has made the goal of plac@@ ing the province on a sustain@@ ably higher growth pat@@ h a central part of its economic development strategy 
In the Mar@@ ch budget address a year ago it was emphas@@ ized that government intended to use its procu@@ rement sp@@ end on goods and services , 
As the D@@ T@@ P will no longer be established as a P@@ P@@ P , the R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m allocated to the project in this years budget will be rou@@ ted via I@@ th@@ ala to facilitate site preparation work including site acquisition , per@@ im@@ eter f@@ encing , 
This does not mean that we will be neg@@ lec@@ ting the need for continued support for primary co@@ oper@@ atives . The initi@@ al allocation of R@@ 1@@ 10@@ m to I@@ th@@ ala in the current financial year 
This investment will stimul@@ ate economic development along these nodes and open up the areas in question to tourism and related services 
A@@ C@@ SA to acqu@@ ire a ten year management contract from the province with the right to take up a conc@@ ession within or after the 10 year term ; 
This is a significant development , as h@@ en@@ ce@@ for@@ th governance and risk management issues cut@@ ting across all departments will be highlighted at an executive level . 
This pressure on I@@ th@@ ala is a reflec@@ tion that in S@@ M@@ M@@ E finance for the disadvantaged , I@@ th@@ ala is the institution of choice . 
In terms of overall economic growth , according to St@@ ats SA KwaZulu-Natal recorded a growth rate of 4 ,@@ 9 in 200@@ 4 , second only to the Western Cape at 5 ,@@ 3 and above the national growth rate of 4 ,@@ 5 
Establ@@ ishment of secondary co@@ oper@@ atives 
which we hope to conclu@@ de by Dec@@ ember 200@@ 6 . A@@ ward of the contract will follow and it is expected that main construction will comm@@ ence in Mar@@ ch 2007 , with facilities to be completed and operational by October 200@@ 9 . 
But some of you might legiti@@ mat@@ ely ask whether all these government interventions have had a mea@@ surable effect on improving the economic performance of the province . 
The D@@ u@@ be Tr@@ ade@@ Port as a stat@@ u@@ tory public entity will be man@@ d@@ ated to drive the trade zone development , the c@@ y@@ ber@@ port , the agricultural zone and other associated commercial developments . 
Before the end of June the Department of Economic Development will conven@@ e a conference involving representatives of all municipalities to discuss common and coordinated approach to Local Economic Development . 
We must re@@ alise that we are do@@ om@@ ing the co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ ME@@ s we are establishing to failure from the out@@ set unless we follow through by facil@@ itating access to government procu@@ rement on a sustainable basis . 
The University of KwaZulu-Natal will also be approached on a similar basis . 
J@@ ust to what extent these impres@@ sive growth and employment figures are due to government programmes and expenditure is difficult to quanti@@ fy at this stage . 
 we are of the un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able view that 
To this end , we aim to build on the second economy initiatives and programmes we implemented last year . 
Many people in the iz@@ im@@ b@@ iz@@ o reported del@@ ays in getting approval this is simply due to the large volumes of applications . 
Although we have indeed made progress in addressing the central challenges of poverty , un@@ employment and service back@@ logs in the past year , much remains to be done in the short , medium and long term . 
Criminal investigations , which will even@@ tually lead to prosecution , are being conducted by the Special Investig@@ ation Unit , a division of the National Prosecu@@ ting Authority . 
It will apply to both civil engineering works such as airports , run@@ ways , bridges , roads etc , as well as general building works . 
which has more than fif@@ ty years experience in promoting the growth of small scale industries and business enterprises . We are expl@@ oring two areas of cooperation with the N@@ S@@ IC@@ : 
The SE@@ D@@ As will work in collaboration with I@@ th@@ ala and the Department of Economic Development to provide support services at district level 
and finance , real estate and business services , which gre@@ w at 7 ,@@ 9 . The manufacturing sector gre@@ w at a healthy rate of 4 ,@@ 5 . 
 and failure to meet the dead@@ line is not an option then all role-players will have to play their part , including this Legisl@@ ature . 
but that B@@ E@@ E@@ -@@ owned companies and emerging contractors enjoy maximum benefit from the contracts put out to tender . Treasury has accord@@ ingly developed a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed infrastructure procu@@ rement policy 
We remain determined therefore to fulfil our obligations to the taxpay@@ ing citizens of this country by main@@ taining and indeed improving our high standards in the field of financial management and good governance . 
Treasury took an unprecedented move to engage law@@ yers to op@@ pose court applications against the Department of Social Wel@@ fare , and that sa@@ ved millions of ran@@ ds while it un@@ covered a sc@@ am which was dr@@ aining funds destin@@ ed for the poor . 
Mr Speaker , Honourable Members , I must st@@ ress that if the dead@@ line for the project to be operational by 200@@ 9 is to be met 
and other ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ities , amoun@@ ting to the loss of ten@@ s of millions of ran@@ ds in various departments , public enti@@ ties and municipalities were conducted and completed during the course of the year . 
in such a way that governments B@@ E@@ E policy and objectives are met . I exp@@ ect in the coming year to be able to report actual expenditure figures per department on procu@@ rement from B@@ E@@ E companies , S@@ M@@ ME@@ s and co@@ oper@@ atives . 
unless at the same time we focus as a government on improving effici@@ encies and achiev@@ ing better value for the vast su@@ ms of money we sp@@ end on these programmes . 
May I remin@@ d you again of the words of Alf@@ red lor@@ d T@@ en@@ nys@@ on who sa@@ id@@ : 
We pro@@ pose to set as@@ ide R@@ 90 million and R@@ 1@@ 00 million in 200@@ 7@@ /@@ 0@@ 8 and 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 respec@@ tively for development of the ID@@ Z , 
In the M@@ TE@@ F period , therefore , funding allocations of R@@ 50 , R5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 6@@ 0@@ m have been set as@@ ide for the development of soccer at all levels in the province in collaboration with SA@@ F@@ A 
with a tol@@ l free number to assist with qu@@ eries . This will be set up by April this year . 
Pro@@ g@@ ress was also made in enfor@@ cing our policy of zer@@ o tolerance for fraud and corruption . Si@@ x high prof@@ ile investigations into fraud , corruption , theft , mis@@ management , mal@@ administration 
I can say with some confidence that the programmes and economic sectors being prioriti@@ sed by government , with one or two excep@@ tions , appear to be yiel@@ ding positive results in terms of performance and trends over the last two years . 
In respect of Per@@ form@@ ance Bud@@ ge@@ ting System , the roll@@ out of the system in departments is proce@@ eding on sch@@ edule , and demonstr@@ ation data bases have been installed in Provincial Treasury , Health and Transport . 
that will bring banks and other financial institutions to participate in the funding of S@@ M@@ ME@@ s in the Province , there@@ by reli@@ ev@@ ing the pressure on I@@ th@@ ala . 
The balance of funds required will have to come from debt financing . The Development Bank has already agreed in principle to provide debt funding secu@@ red against revenue stre@@ ams of the project up to R5@@ 00@@ m . 
income per capit@@ a will rise by 50 in the next ten years , and the rate of un@@ employment will be hal@@ ved . 
In this regard , government has identified several key projects and programmes as priorities for the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ TE@@ F . These can be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follow@@ s: 
It is un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic however , to exp@@ ect that the provincial economy will launch itself onto a higher growth pat@@ h on its own accor@@ d . A structural growth acc@@ el@@ eration of this mag@@ nit@@ ude will require , 
We have secu@@ red a legally bin@@ ding Mo@@ U with A@@ C@@ SA and the National Minister of Transport providing for@@ : 
S@@ ite preparation and installation of back@@ b@@ one infrastructure is expected to comm@@ ence by the end of the cal@@ end@@ ar year . 
The challenge facing government in implementing these and other infrastructure projects is not only to ensure that delivery and expenditure takes place within planned time@@ fr@@ ames ,

It is often heard that leng@@ thy del@@ ays occur in paying the S@@ M@@ ME@@ s 
When President Mbeki sa@@ id@@ : Clearly the m@@ asses of our people are conv@@ in@@ ced that our country has entered into its age of Hop@@ e , I am certain that we in KwaZulu-Natal will say S@@ I@@ Y@@ A@@ V@@ U@@ M@@ A . 
based on an average of 9 people per co@@ operative many of these have already found employment through their co@@ oper@@ atives or are likely to do so in the near future . 
to build the infrastructure and facilities required for training and base camps . We are also of the view however that we need not just to build soccer stadium infrastructure , but also the sport itself in the province . 
Dis@@ cus@@ sions are also in progress on the financing model for the Trade Port . The total investment required for the air@@ port , which is part of the Trade Port , is about R2 .@@ 5 billion over the next four to five years . 
7@@ 0 at Social Wel@@ fare ; 2@@ 3 at Home Affairs ; 3 ,@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 in other departments ; and 15 medical doctors and agents were implic@@ ated . 
back@@ b@@ one infrastructure out@@ lay and the development of the N@@ 2 inter@@ change . The ten@@ ders for this initi@@ al site preparation and technical work have already closed and are currently being adjudic@@ ated . 
once again well above the national average , and close to the A@@ S@@ G@@ I@@ -@@ SA target of 6 . 
The provincial budget will accord@@ ingly continue to play a key role as policy instr@@ ument to address the soci@@ o@@ economic challenges confron@@ ting us . 
This is concrete proof of the special attention we pay to the promotion of opportunities for women and youth empowerment . 
Fun@@ ding in the amount of R5@@ 0@@ m , R5@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 60 ,@@ 5@@ m has been allocated to the Department of Economic Development for the establishment of secondary and ter@@ tiary co@@ oper@@ atives in the M@@ TE@@ F period . 
We have undertaken to co@@ operate with and assist the South African W@@ om@@ en En@@ tre@@ prene@@ ur@@ s in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry . 
This ID@@ Z was pro@@ claimed by the Minister of Trade and Industry in 2002 . Since then , however , there has not been any significant progress in terms of infrastructure out@@ l@@ ays required to make the ID@@ Z work .

and that have sufficient experience and resources 
IN@@ TE@@ R@@ V@@ E@@ N@@ TION TH@@ RE@@ E@@ : Val@@ ue for money and good governance initiatives 
It is su@@ rely no co@@ incid@@ ence , however , that growth in the construction sector is sur@@ ging , given the provincial governments increased expenditure on infrastructure to@@ t@@ all@@ ing R@@ 7 ,@@ 4@@ 2 b@@ n over the last two years . 
In this regard , I have t@@ asked the Treasury with establishing a small unit to focus on f@@ ast-@@ trac@@ king of payments to co@@ oper@@ atives and S@@ M@@ ME@@ s , 
Sec@@ tors in the province which experienced particularly strong growth in 200@@ 4 were construction , which gre@@ w at a st@@ agg@@ ering 2@@ 8 ,@@ 8 , 
As at the end of Dec@@ ember 200@@ 5 , I@@ th@@ ala had approved 4@@ 0@@ 5 S@@ M@@ M@@ E business plans worth R@@ 4@@ 3@@ 3 million . O@@ f this amount over R@@ 1@@ 7@@ 9 million has already been dis@@ bur@@ sed . 
In April 200@@ 6 a detailed Request for Pro@@ pos@@ als will be issued to selected b@@ id@@ ders to prepare more detailed bi@@ ds . By September 200@@ 6 a b@@ id@@ der will be selected and detailed negotiations will comm@@ ence , 
During the past financial year the Provincial Government provided an amount of R@@ 200@@ m to I@@ th@@ ala to drive the S@@ M@@ M@@ E programme for the province pen@@ ding the fin@@ alisation of a structured S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund . 
A provincial supply ch@@ ain management framework policy has been compiled to provide provincial departments with guidelines on how to proc@@ ure goods and services , including from co@@ oper@@ atives , 
In the coming year therefore , we are going to be implementing a new programme to support S@@ M@@ ME@@ s the details of which I will reve@@ al shortly . 
It should come as no sur@@ prise therefore , that the budget expenditure pro@@ pos@@ als for 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 recommended by Cabinet can be categ@@ or@@ ized into three broad areas which are consistent with the them@@ es which underp@@ in@@ ned last years budget , nam@@ el@@ y: 
for services rendered and/or supplies provided . 
The consequence of this is the need to expand the Department of Economic Development , with more staff employed to provide support centres in all dis@@ tric@@ ts in collaboration with municipal initiatives and to strengthen Local Economic Development . 
and the anticipated sa@@ vings are as follow@@ s: R@@ 9 ,@@ 4@@ m sa@@ vings per month ; R@@ 1@@ 1@@ 3@@ m sa@@ vings per ann@@ um and R@@ 3@@ 3@@ 8@@ m sa@@ vings over a 3 year period . Furthermore a number of government officials and members of civil society were identified as suspec@@ t@@ s: 
- this com@@ pa@@ res to a growth rate for K@@ Z@@ N in 200@@ 3 of just 2 ,@@ 8 . In 200@@ 5 K@@ Z@@ N@@ s economic growth rate is pro@@ jected to be in the region of 5 ,@@ 2 , 
We have welcomed the launch of S@@ m@@ all En@@ ter@@ prise Development Agency as a brand of D@@ T@@ I to support S@@ M@@ ME@@ s and co@@ ops . 
improving the un@@ employment rate from 3@@ 3 .@@ 1 in 200@@ 4 to 3@@ 1 .@@ 8 in 200@@ 5 . This dec@@ re@@ ase in un@@ employment was in fact f@@ aster than the national average , which dec@@ lined from 2@@ 7 .@@ 9 to 2@@ 6 .@@ 5 over the same period . 
Cre@@ ating jobs and al@@ levi@@ ating poverty through targeted interventions in the second economy 
During the year we invest@@ ed R@@ 8@@ 0 million in the social welfare grants investigation which has yiel@@ ded tremendous value to the province . 2@@ 5 ,@@ 9@@ 5@@ 6 fraud@@ ul@@ ent grants were identified in this investigation 
The deal flow that is currently under consideration by I@@ th@@ ala is standing at R1 .@@ 5@@ b@@ n . It is safe to sugg@@ est that between R5@@ 00@@ m to R@@ 1@@ b@@ n of those deals would be worthy of funding . 
As import@@ antly , the payment process to S@@ M@@ ME@@ s by Government Depart@@ ments leaves much to be des@@ ired . 
 this will have a positive impact on the re@@ vi@@ val of U@@ l@@ undi as a regional centre . 
A ter@@ tiary co@@ operative will provide support to co@@ oper@@ atives through ap@@ e@@ x level institutions . It will also advoc@@ ate and engage organs of state , the private sector and the stakeholders on behalf of its members . 
The second major infra@@ struc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related programme being adv@@ anced by the provincial government rel@@ ates to financial support for the development of soccer stadiums in the province in preparation for the 20@@ 10 World Cup . 
is that the ter@@ tiary co@@ operative should manage the entire value ch@@ ain , 
only by u@@ plif@@ ting the m@@ asses strugg@@ ling to survi@@ ve in the second economy will we be able to achieve sustain@@ ably higher growth rates over the longer term , and h@@ ence our end-@@ goal of prosp@@ er@@ ity for all . 
The growth of co@@ oper@@ atives requires a major shift in our strategy . Co@@ ops are a community movement . For sustain@@ ability we need to institu@@ tion@@ alise the co@@ oper@@ atives movement . 
Other infra@@ struc@@ tu@@ re-@@ related strategic projects we pro@@ pose to fund over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F period are the two road corrid@@ ors leading to Ric@@ h@@ ards Bay , namely the Lu@@ bom@@ bo SD@@ I corrid@@ or and the P@@ 7@@ 00 lin@@ king to U@@ l@@ undi and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely V@@ ry@@ he@@ id . 
O@@ f the approved business plans to date , 3@@ 2@@ 8 involve fem@@ ale only co@@ oper@@ atives , 2@@ 3@@ 5 youth , 12@@ 5 m@@ ale and 9@@ 6 mi@@ xed co@@ oper@@ atives . 
Contin@@ u@@ ed support for small business development 
nor crowd out emerging lo@@ an capital , but to compl@@ ement the existing off@@ er@@ ings and provide lo@@ an options for those entrepreneur@@ s and small businesses who are pres@@ ently unable to access affor@@ dable lo@@ an finance due to a range of factors . 
The full details of the ex@@ act nature , purpose and governance framework for the Fund will be set out in the Information M@@ emor@@ andum for the K@@ Z@@ N S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund . 
Acc@@ ess to research and technical support for better production processes . 
The business partners and financial institutions who participate in the Fund will by agreement access the existing S@@ M@@ M@@ E deal flow generated by I@@ th@@ ala . 
to address the whole agricultural value ch@@ ain , including marketing , transport , processing , pack@@ aging and bran@@ ding , the provision of technical advice , and support to emerging farmers through the lo@@ an of trac@@ tors , impl@@ ements and equipment . 
the U@@ SA , the Mid@@ dle East and A@@ sia . Another objective is 
The initi@@ al contribution of R@@ 200@@ m from government in the first year of the M@@ TE@@ F will be followed by allocations of R2@@ 20@@ m and R2@@ 4@@ 2@@ m in the outer two years .

A@@ gr@@ arian revol@@ ution 
The focus of ag@@ r@@ arian revol@@ ution projects and interventions will be on boo@@ s@@ ting the capacity of secondary agricultural co@@ oper@@ atives at the district level 
It must be emphas@@ ised that the ag@@ r@@ arian revol@@ ution concept is not only about agriculture . It emb@@ rac@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of development of our rural areas , 
Applicants who have applied to I@@ th@@ ala for lo@@ ans should not be surprised therefore if their deals end up being finan@@ ced by another financial institution 
AB@@ SA has already indicated a w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to comm@@ it R2@@ 5@@ m to funding small and mic@@ r@@ o enterprises ne@@ eding lo@@ an finance of less than R@@ 3 million . We are also at adv@@ anced st@@ ages of discussions with Stand@@ ard Bank and Fir@@ st National . 
This document will form the basis for the participation of any other financial institution in the Fund . 
Acc@@ ess to markets 
Dis@@ cus@@ sions with FN@@ B have not been finalised . Together with a provincial government contribution of R@@ 200@@ m which we will make available , the intention is to le@@ verage total funding of over R1 ,@@ 5 b@@ n for the S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund by June 200@@ 6 . 
Our message is@@ : 
The Fund is designed as a central component of a small enterprise l@@ ending framework , which see@@ ks not to compe@@ te with other commercial S@@ M@@ M@@ E l@@ enders in the market , 
 the important thing is that all S@@ M@@ M@@ E business lo@@ an applications will be attended to within the coming year . 
No@@ te that the funds will be held against the V@@ o@@ te of the Provincial Treasury pen@@ ding dis@@ burs@@ ement to the S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund . 
The objective is to develop the provinces enorm@@ ous potential in agriculture into a competitive advantage by util@@ ising all of its 5@@ 90 bi@@ o-@@ resource regions to produce vege@@ tables , fru@@ it and meat products for export to Euro@@ pe , 
A dram@@ atic reduction in farming input costs 
Stand@@ ard Bank has indicated that subject to agreement on governance arrangements , they will make available R2@@ 5@@ 0@@ m for the financing of S@@ M@@ ME@@ s applying for finance between R@@ 3@@ m and R@@ 3@@ 0@@ m . 
Another key second economy intervention is that of the ag@@ r@@ arian revol@@ ution , whose main aim is to ensure household food security and to move sub@@ s@@ istence farmers up@@ wards towards the first economy . 
Bus@@ iness Par@@ t@@ ners in collaboration with K@@ h@@ ula , will work with I@@ th@@ ala to open access to I@@ th@@ ala applicants to the R@@ 15@@ 0@@ m start up capital for S@@ M@@ M@@ E and B@@ E@@ E funding . 
Acc@@ ess to support for land reform beneficiaries , and 
to reduce the reli@@ ance on the import@@ ation of basic foo@@ d@@ stu@@ ffs and to bring down food prices through a comprehensive support programme for emerging farmers which will facil@@ it@@ ate: 
Division of revenue framework and re@@ vised provincial allocations over the M@@ TE@@ F 
demonstr@@ ating governments ongoing commitment to improving the quality and reach of education . The budget includes additional funding in 
'@@ n En@@ suring the vi@@ ability of the land res@@ titu@@ tion process , through the facil@@ itation of viable programmes for such areas 
and is a first step towards al@@ ig@@ ning service delivery provision between the local and provincial spheres of government . 
The Department of Community Safety & Li@@ ais@@ on receives R@@ 50 ,@@ 8 million this year , an increase of 5 .@@ 5 per cent . As the department received a substantial additional allocation last year , there are no additional funds allocated in this years budget . 
Parliament receives R@@ 1@@ 3@@ 9 ,@@ 2 million , an increase of 7 .@@ 6 per cent over the previous year , including an additional allocation over bas@@ eline of R@@ 15 ,@@ 7 million 
for EM@@ IS , the National Cur@@ ricul@@ um Stat@@ ement , AB@@ ET , F@@ ET Col@@ leges and the introduction of the no fee schools policy . 
the provision for government employees medical scheme to cover those civil serv@@ ants not covered by medical aid , and the phas@@ ing in of the food relief 
Education is allocated a budget of R@@ 16 ,@@ 20@@ 9 billion . The 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 budget repres@@ ents an increase of 11 .@@ 7 per cent over last year , 
which provides access to markets 
and anti@@ fraud and corruption measures aimed at stre@@ am@@ lining the drivers and learners licence system . No@@ te that the department receives very substantial incre@@ ases in this budget in the outer two years of the M@@ TE@@ F . 
This includes additional funding in the amount of R@@ 7@@ 0 million for maintenance , new road works and access bridges , 
In particular , the unit will work closely with the Department of Economic Development , the Regional Off@@ ices of the Land Cla@@ im@@ s Commission and Land Affairs , and other provincial departments 
Agriculture and Environmental Affairs receives R1 ,@@ 2@@ 9@@ 9 billion , an increase of 24 .@@ 2 per cent . 
In@@ clu@@ ded in this allocation is additional funding in the amount of R@@ 3@@ 1@@ m for co@@ ordinating the provision of soccer stadi@@ a infrastructure in District Municip@@ alities and the Metro , 
There is a growing need for government to interven@@ e in the second economy through our instr@@ ument for economic empowerment , I@@ th@@ ala . While much has been achieved in the last year 
No@@ te that all funding in the Poverty Al@@ leviation Fund has been allocated to specific departments , while specific allocations have also been made to various departments 
Establ@@ ishment of acceler@@ ated economic development unit within I@@ th@@ ala 
I turn now to the expenditure pro@@ pos@@ als . In line with established practice and sound financial principles , the province is aim@@ ing at a bal@@ anced budget for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year 
In respect of the total budget allocations for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year@@ : 
Over and above this , most departments will be receiving additional funding over the M@@ TE@@ F for specific purposes and projects , as indicated in Table 3 in the printed speech . 
with a view to ensuring the sustain@@ ability of the 20 major land res@@ titu@@ tion projects around the province . A Task Team coordinated by the Economic Technical Cl@@ ust@@ er of Cabinet has already been established 
Treasury has engaged the Department of Agriculture on an appropriate model for the planning , coordination , and approval of the ag@@ r@@ arian revol@@ ution projects . 
while service delivery issues and capacity constraints are also addressed in the budget pro@@ pos@@ als . 
An amount of R@@ 4@@ 0@@ m will be allocated to the Department of Economic Development in the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year as governments contribution to the start up costs of the new unit . 
R2@@ 8@@ 0 million for the maintenance of the provincial road infrastructure ; 
R5@@ 0@@ m of this increased allocation is ear@@ marked for the establishment of secondary co@@ ops , R@@ 1@@ 00@@ m for primary co@@ ops , R@@ 3@@ 0@@ m for the in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator programme , 
Tran@@ sports budget of R2 ,@@ 4@@ 16 billion in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 is an increase of 9 .@@ 9 per cent over last year . 
R@@ 1@@ 10 million to strengthen the F@@ ET col@@ leges ; and 
Inv@@ esting in re@@ vi@@ val of township economies 
The budget pro@@ pos@@ als will simultaneously lead to sustainable economic growth and investment , job creation , poverty al@@ leviation , and broader participation in the economy 
from communities and interest groups across the province we are left with the fir@@ m impres@@ sion that this is truly a budget for the people by the people of the province . 
No@@ te that the amounts per project are the total su@@ m over the three years of the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F period . It should also be noted that 
Gi@@ ven the limited resources , substantial re@@ prioriti@@ z@@ ation and tr@@ ade@@ off@@ s had to be made this is of course the ess@@ ence of what the budge@@ ting process is all about . 
is the single most important im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment to vi@@ ability and sustain@@ ability , and this asp@@ ect will be a major focus area of I@@ th@@ al@@ as Acc@@ eler@@ ated Economic Development Unit and the other role-players mentioned . 
I@@ th@@ ala is therefore in the process of establishing a new business unit called Acc@@ eler@@ ated Economic Development Unit , which will facilitate delivery in the following are@@ as@@ : 
The Department of S@@ port & Rec@@ re@@ ation is allocated a budget of R@@ 10@@ 6 ,@@ 1 million , a 19 .@@ 3 per cent increase over last year . 
and requires a high degree of coordination and cooperation between various provincial departments and district municipalities . The Department of Tran@@ sports African Ren@@ aissance Road Up@@ grad@@ ing Programme , 
Once again Minister T@@ re@@ v@@ or Man@@ u@@ el and the Team Finance have provided inval@@ u@@ able advice and guidance on the technical issues and national budget framework which underp@@ in this budget . 
As explained this dec@@ re@@ ase is at@@ tribu@@ table to the removal of the social assistance grant funding from its budget . The department ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless receives 
Facil@@ itation of new investment and increased trade within the Province 
However , the quality of information received from departments in their budget sub@@ missions in terms of their spatial spending and service delivery g@@ aps was relatively in@@ complete and inadequate . 
The budge@@ ted revenue for 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 is made up as follow@@ s: 
the provincial budget actually grow@@ s by 13 .@@ 4 per cent over last years main budget , again excluding the social security grant funding . This is not an in@@ considerable increase , 
In his medium term budget policy statement , the Minister of Finance tabl@@ ed the division of revenue between the three government spheres . 
There are many people who contributed to the budget pro@@ pos@@ als which we table today . The support provided by the Premier H@@ on J@@ S N@@ de@@ bel@@ e and my Cabinet Col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues is most sincerely appreci@@ ated . 
Tot@@ al funding request by departments 
will be collec@@ tively spending no less than R@@ 3@@ b@@ n over the for@@ th@@ coming M@@ TE@@ F on comb@@ ating HIV and AIDS , including the further expansion and roll@@ out of the P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al and hom@@ e-@@ based care programmes 
Ex@@ pan@@ sion of existing programmes and capacity building initiatives aimed at improving service delivery 
Health is allocated a budget of R@@ 11 ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 7 billion , an increase of 13 .@@ 1 per cent . This relatively large percentage increase reflects the high priority which government , both national and provincial , 
but Hop@@ e s@@ mil@@ es at the th@@ res@@ hold of the year to come wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing , it will be hap@@ pi@@ er The 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 Provincial budget process 
For the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F , a total of R@@ 9 ,@@ 7 billion in additional funding was requested by various departments . This is against a total of R@@ 4 ,@@ 6 billion available in the provincial resource en@@ velop@@ e . 
In short , I believe that this budget provides us with all the necessary resources to proce@@ ed , on sch@@ edule , along our jour@@ ney to prosp@@ er@@ ity for all . 
Economic Development ge@@ ts R@@ 3@@ 90 ,@@ 1 million in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , a 1@@ 7@@ 7 per cent increase over last year . Before I am accused of ne@@ po@@ tis@@ m , let me draw attention to the fact that 
who have once again have played a most constructive role in eng@@ aging with Treasury on budge@@ tary and financial management issues . 
K@@ Z@@ N@@ s share of additional funding 
The third area which government is prioriti@@ sing in this budget rel@@ ates to expan@@ ding and improving the quality of existing programmes and projects . O@@ f note are the following al@@ loc@@ ation@@ s: 
and outer two years of the M@@ TE@@ F period . The full amount of revenue available to the province for the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 financial year , namely R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 2 billion , is allocated to the various provincial departments . 
Before Honourable Members become al@@ armed , however , I should explain that the dec@@ re@@ ase is enti@@ rely at@@ tribu@@ table to the removal of the social security condi@@ tional grant funding from the provincial budgets al@@ together 
This exercise reve@@ aled that indeed we are funding these national priorities more than adequ@@ ately , and all the national priority programmes have been allocated healthy incre@@ ases in their bas@@ eline budgets over the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F . 
in accordance with their legislative man@@ dates and any sec@@ tor@@ -specific norms and standards . 
It was made clear to departments that this will become a standard approach for future budget sub@@ missions . If nothing else , this approach has brought about a change in the min@@ d@@ set of departments 
For the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 financial year , the province is budge@@ ting for total revenue of R@@ 3@@ 7 ,@@ 19@@ 1 billion . This repres@@ ents a dec@@ re@@ ase of 18 ,@@ 4 per cent as compared to last years main budget . 
E@@ P@@ W@@ P and B@@ B@@ B@@ E@@ E principles will apply to all additional funding allocated to infrastructure and main@@ ten@@ an@@ ce-@@ related projects . 
This includes additional funding as mentioned for increasing capacity in the department , in the amount of R@@ 18 ,@@ 9 million , as well as R@@ 4@@ m for the car@@ r@@ y-@@ through costs of the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 adj@@ ust@@ ments estim@@ ate . 
R2@@ 90 million for Ad@@ ul@@ t Bas@@ ic Education & Training ; 
in terms of the number of new entrepreneur@@ s entering the market , there is a need to create better focus within I@@ th@@ ala in order to acceler@@ ate delivery in this all important empowerment initiative . 
The Ro@@ yal H@@ ou@@ se@@ hold receives R@@ 3@@ 1 ,@@ 4 million in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , an increase of 13 .@@ 8 per cent over last year . 
to R@@ 13 ,@@ 8@@ 32 b@@ n in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 compared to R@@ 12 ,@@ 7@@ 7@@ 1 b@@ n in the current year . 
additional funding to@@ t@@ all@@ ing R@@ 9@@ 7 ,@@ 5@@ m as a result of the phas@@ ing in of the F@@ ood Rel@@ i@@ ef and HIV and AIDS grants . Although not in our budget the condi@@ tional grant for social assistance grants 
I am confident however that we have succeeded in formul@@ ating budget pro@@ pos@@ als which truly reflect the provincial policy priorities as approved by the provincial executive , and will go a long way towards satis@@ fying the asp@@ ir@@ ations of popular expec@@ tations . 
and the HIV and AIDS condi@@ tional grants into the equitable share . For 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , R@@ 3@@ 9@@ 7 million is available for discre@@ tionary spending , ris@@ ing to R@@ 3 .@@ 2 billion in 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 . 
shows an increase 
The number of beneficiaries in year 200@@ 0@@ /@@ 0@@ 1 was 6@@ 21 ,@@ 4@@ 9@@ 4 compared to 1 ,@@ 8@@ 36 ,@@ 9@@ 75 in year 200@@ 4@@ /@@ 0@@ 5 . 
for the car@@ r@@ y-@@ through costs of the Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate allocations last year , and R@@ 9 ,@@ 5@@ m and R@@ 6 ,@@ 7@@ m for catering for cultural affairs and office administrative costs respec@@ tively . 
R5@@ 8 million to develop commun@@ al agricultural infrastructure ; 
The social services are once again prioriti@@ sed in terms of the growth rates in their M@@ TE@@ F allocations , 
The purpose of this spatial exercise was to move towards at@@ taining a comprehensive economic al@@ ign@@ ment strategy for the province , by trying to identify provincial departments spending 
for co@@ ordinating soccer development in the province in collaboration with SA@@ F@@ A , as well the additional allocations already referred to for extr@@ a capacity in the executive council secre@@ tari@@ al services , 
can@@ e and tim@@ ber production become viable and sustainable in as short a time as possible . Without excep@@ tion , the lack of lo@@ an financing for the initi@@ al capit@@ alisation of the projects

from the Provincial G@@ rowth Fund for strategic provincial projects such as the D@@ u@@ be Trade Port , Ric@@ h@@ ards Bay ID@@ Z and infrastructure for the 20@@ 10 S@@ occer World Cup . 
No@@ te the additional allocations made in the two outer years of the M@@ TE@@ F for the establishment of spor@@ ting and recre@@ ation facilities . 
The Department of Social Wel@@ fare and Pop@@ ul@@ ations budget dec@@ reas@@ es from R@@ 13 ,@@ 6@@ 0@@ 5 b@@ n last year to R@@ 8@@ 9@@ 5@@ m a dec@@ re@@ ase of no less than 9@@ 3 .@@ 4 per cent . 
The unit will create capacity to deliver on the above areas and thus re@@ alising government objectives of reducing poverty and un@@ employment .

Mr Speaker , I turn now to the detail of the provincial budget pro@@ pos@@ als for the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 M@@ TE@@ F . 
Mr Speaker , we remain committed for example to continue w@@ aging a rel@@ ent@@ less campaign to comb@@ at the ra@@ v@@ aging effects of the HIV and AIDS syn@@ dro@@ me on our society . To this end provincial departments 
And dem@@ an@@ ding , because pu@@ tting budgets together , which involves making informed ch@@ o@@ ices and mat@@ ching limited resources against compe@@ ting needs and demands , is never an easy process . 
for the car@@ ry@@ - through costs of the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 adj@@ ust@@ ments estim@@ ate , new po@@ sts and I@@ T support and systems . 
I also wish to extend my than@@ ks to the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Por@@ t@@ foli@@ o Committee , Mr C@@ y@@ ri@@ l X@@ aba and his Committee , 
Mr Speaker , comp@@ iling these budget pro@@ pos@@ als has been both a ple@@ a@@ surable and dem@@ an@@ ding task . P@@ lea@@ surable , in that there has been tremend@@ ously positive input and advice received 
R2@@ 9@@ m for the Community Development Wor@@ kers programme , R@@ 24 ,@@ 1 million for Project Con@@ solid@@ ate , Dis@@ aster Management Cent@@ res and the R@@ ural Con@@ nec@@ tivity Programme , 
The Housing budget records a substantial lea@@ p to R1 ,@@ 2@@ 5@@ 2 billion , an increase of no less than 29 .@@ 1 per cent over last year . 
and there is little doubt that the provincial government has adequate financial resources at its disposal in this budget to deliver on its mandate to the elec@@ torate . 
 this funding has been transferred to the newly established Social Security Agency at a national level . Ta@@ king out the social security grant funding of some R@@ 13 ,@@ 8@@ b@@ n in 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 , 
The Department of Wor@@ ks receives R@@ 4@@ 5@@ 1 ,@@ 5 million this year , an increase of 6 .@@ 0 per cent over the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 budget . 
This includes additional funding of R@@ 1@@ 10@@ m as mentioned for the ag@@ r@@ arian revol@@ ution programme , 
The main reason for the dec@@ re@@ ase is that Treasury will no longer have the centr@@ alised Poverty Al@@ leviation Fund held against its budget , 
The Provincial Treasury receives R1 ,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 9 billion , a nomin@@ al dec@@ re@@ ase of 1 .@@ 8 per cent over last years main budget . 
The primary focus of the 200@@ 6@@ /@@ 0@@ 7 Treasury Gu@@ id@@ elines was on the review and re@@ prioriti@@ sation of departments budgets , as well as on an analysis of their spatial spending and service delivery in each district municipality . 
The expenditure framework provides for R@@ 3@@ 1 billion in additional equitable share allocation to the provinces over the M@@ TE@@ F . 
while even the balance of the Provincial G@@ rowth Fund and S@@ M@@ M@@ E Fund will only be hous@@ ed in Trea@@ sur@@ ys budget on a temporary basis , pen@@ ding approval of projects and consequ@@ ent transfer of funds to the I@@ th@@ ala 
 this is the total expenditure across the Depart@@ ments of Health , Social Wel@@ fare and Education . The respective departments will be providing further details on these and other poverty al@@ leviation programmes in their respective budget documentation . 
The Department of Ar@@ ts , Cul@@ ture and Tourism receives a budget of R2@@ 5@@ 4 ,@@ 7 million , a 21 .@@ 6 per cent increase over last year . This includes an additional allocation of R@@ 18 ,@@ 7 million 
with the mandate to ensure that the commercial enterprises ear@@ marked for the major land res@@ titu@@ tion projects such as game farming and ec@@ ot@@ ourism , 
R@@ 4@@ 0@@ m for the Acc@@ eler@@ ated Development Unit in I@@ th@@ ala , and R2@@ 0@@ m for the D@@ u@@ be Trade Port . Pre@@ vi@@ ously these funds were kept in Treasury before they were transferred to I@@ th@@ ala . 
Mr Speaker , I have dealt at length with the major policy priorities and therefore I wish to brief@@ ly explain the division of revenue and M@@ TE@@ F framework which underp@@ ins this provincial budget . 
The Office of the Premier is allocated R 2@@ 9@@ 4 ,@@ 7 million , an increase of 3@@ 5 .@@ 1 per cent over the 200@@ 5@@ /@@ 0@@ 6 budget . This large increase is mainly at@@ tribu@@ table to an allocation of R5@@ 0@@ m 
The Department of Local Government and Tr@@ adi@@ tional Affairs ge@@ ts R5@@ 9@@ 5 ,@@ 6 million , a 29 .@@ 9 per cent increase . 
Other key role-players include the Depart@@ ments of Economic Development , Housing , Ar@@ ts , Cul@@ ture and Tourism and the regional offices of the Department of Land Affairs and Land Cla@@ im@@ s Commission . 
We are also recomm@@ ending additional allocations in order to help departments increase their internal capacity and improve service delivery . 
continues to accor@@ d to the delivery of social services , and includes an additional allocation of R@@ 24 ,@@ 6 million for improving maintenance in hospitals . 
Mr Speaker , I want to emphas@@ ise that before the Cabinet decided on how the additional funding available for allocation should be ap@@ por@@ tioned among departments and programmes , we did a comprehensive co@@ s@@ ting and ben@@ ch@@ marking exercise 
Ex@@ p@@ end@@ it@@ ure pro@@ pos@@ als and depart@@ mental allocations 
This allocation will also support the regulatory activities of the G@@ am@@ bl@@ ing Board . A request from the Department of Housing for additional capacity has also been recommended to support various initiatives such as training of housing beneficiaries . 
Table 1 in the printed speech presents the amount of additional funding available to the province for further allocation , taking into account pro@@ jected provincial own revenue and two national policy direc@@ tives ;

The world economy is in a wor@@ se position than it has been in several decades . According to a report by the International Labour Organis@@ ation , more than million people could lose their jobs this year

The public@@ ation of the Bill for comment therefore repres@@ ents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders , interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed Integr@@ ated Coastal Management Act . 
The questions are often raised why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation is the coast not simply part of the general environment 
The review conclu@@ ded that a dedicated Coastal Management Act was required for implementing the White P@@ ap@@ er . 
This ch@@ apter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Minister and the ME@@ C@@ s . 
The coast is a unique part of the environment . It is the meeting place of the land and sea a limited spatial area that suppor@@ ts many human activities . 
Section 2@@ 5 author@@ ises ME@@ C@@ s to establish coastal se@@ t@@ back lines . 
The Act also requires municipalities to develop municipal CM@@ P@@ s within four years of the Ac@@ ts commen@@ cement , either as stand alone documents or as part of an integrated development plan prepared in accordance with the Municipal Syst@@ ems Act . 
In the past , the value of coastal ecosystems as a cor@@ ner@@ stone for development was not suff@@ ici@@ ently acknowledged in decisi@@ on-@@ making in South Africa . 
The Bill inten@@ ds to regulate the discharge of eff@@ lu@@ ent into coastal waters from any source on land by requ@@ iring permits to author@@ ise such dis@@ charges . 
However , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the Protec@@ ted A@@ re@@ as Act rather than the proposed Integr@@ ated Coastal Management Act . 
The purpose of this Gu@@ ide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period . 
The White P@@ ap@@ er did not me@@ rely provide a vision , principles , goals and objectives for coastal management in South Africa . 
This ch@@ apter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all est@@ u@@ aries by providing that they must be managed , in accordance with@@ : a 
Chapter 5@@ : In@@ stitutional arrangements

Se@@ af@@ ron@@ t development needs to be located behind the lit@@ toral active zone - a hazardous area for development . 
For coastal development to be soci@@ ally sustainable , it should emphas@@ ise public awareness and shared responsibility , em@@ pow@@ ering disadvantaged individuals and communities , including women and the poor . 
The coast is a distinc@@ tive system in which a range of considerations bi@@ oph@@ ys@@ ical , economic , social and institutional inter@@ con@@ n@@ ect , in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach .

Section 3@@ 8 provides for the establishment of Provincial Coastal Commit@@ tees which will be responsible for co@@ ordinating coastal management in each province . Section 3@@ 9 author@@ izes the ME@@ C@@ s of each province to determine the composition of these Commit@@ tees .

In order to secure public access to coastal public property , the Bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land . 
A coastal se@@ t@@ back line may , for example , be established to ensure that the sh@@ ad@@ ows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise . 
In practice this means , for example , that the Minister must ensure that there is cons@@ is@@ tency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans .

Section 5@@ 7 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occup@@ iers of land , coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adver@@ se effects on the coastal environment 
The coastal provinces must develop their own provincial CM@@ P@@ s with@@ inf@@ our years of the commen@@ cement of the Act that are consistent with the national CM@@ P and the National E@@ stu@@ ar@@ ine Management Pro@@ toc@@ ol .

Part 4 deals with the let@@ ting of coastal public property by way of coastal le@@ ases and the gran@@ ting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal conc@@ essions . 
This contr@@ asts with the current situation under the S@@ eas@@ hor@@ e Act where the seas@@ hor@@ e and sea are owned by the President on behalf of the people .@@ Coastal public property is made up primarily of the seas@@ hor@@ e and coastal waters . 
After the Cabinet approved the White P@@ ap@@ er a comprehensive legal review was carried out . Its purpose was to determine whether the White P@@ ap@@ er could be implemented in terms of existing laws . 
E@@ arly dra@@ fts of the Integr@@ ated Coastal Management Bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas . 
Section 3@@ 5 establ@@ ishes a National Coastal Committee which will function at national government level . Section 36 author@@ izes the Minister to determine the composition of the Committee . 
Section 4@@ 0 author@@ izes the ME@@ C@@ s to appoint Vol@@ un@@ tary coastal officers and defin@@ e their roles and responsibilities . 
The protoc@@ ol will provide a national policy for est@@ uary management and guide the development of individual est@@ u@@ ar@@ ine management plans . 
Dem@@ ar@@ cation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal bu@@ ff@@ er zone are only likely to be institu@@ ted where the area designated by the Act is in@@ appropriate and im@@ pe@@ des effective coastal management . 
This provision helps facilitate a new co@@ operative and particip@@ atory approach to manag@@ ing the coast by enhan@@ cing the participation of members of the public in coastal management . 
In@@ clu@@ des@@ : vision , provincial CM@@ O@@ s . 
The coastal resource use planning system established by this Chapter will function as a mechanism for contro@@ lling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is pres@@ ently used . 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land therefore include consideration of environmental factors . 
It took a step further by providing a Plan of Ac@@ tion which out@@ lines in detail how the White P@@ ap@@ er is to be implemented . One of the elements of this Plan of Ac@@ tion is In@@ stitutional and Leg@@ al Development . 
However , this system orientated approach has failed to materi@@ al@@ ize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach foc@@ using 
Coastal waters are ess@@ entially all waters influ@@ enced by ti@@ des and the sea out to the limits of the territ@@ or@@ ial sea . 
rather than as conservation areas . For example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable har@@ v@@ esting of sh@@ ell@@ fish for sub@@ s@@ istence purposes in areas where such har@@ v@@ esting is pres@@ ently de@@ ple@@ ting the sh@@ ell@@ fish resources . 
Section 5@@ 9 provides for the Minister or MEC to issue written no@@ tices requ@@ iring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment . 
The Minister pointed out that due to its complex@@ ity the Bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days . 
This Bill promo@@ tes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management , which views the coast as a system and emphas@@ izes the importance of manag@@ ing it as such . 
The value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estim@@ ated in 1998 to be about R@@ 1@@ 6@@ 8 billion annually , which was equi@@ valent to about 3@@ 5 of our annual G@@ ross D@@ om@@ estic Produc@@ t . 
Chapter 4@@ : E@@ stu@@ aries 
Section 3@@ 7 provides for the design@@ ation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level . 
Re@@ stric@@ ting or contro@@ lling developments in these areas is also essential to take account of the dynam@@ ic nature of the coast

For coastal development to be ec@@ olog@@ ically sustainable , it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources . 
The author@@ isation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment . 
Part 3 prohi@@ bits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit . 
For coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diver@@ si@@ fy opportunities , provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources . 
Pho@@ to: eThekwini Municipality 
A special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas , 
Section 6@@ 8 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for gran@@ ting permits for the use of coastal resources while main@@ taining a high level of environmental protection . 
The current land@@ -@@ use planning system in South Africa is a land@@ -based system that ess@@ entially st@@ ops at the high water mark . 
The Bill requires the Minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .

Ass@@ essing the environmental impact of activities which may de@@ tri@@ mentally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated in terms of N@@ EM@@ A on 21 April 200@@ 6 . 
P@@ res@@ ently the disposal of eff@@ lu@@ ent through pip@@ elines and the dum@@ ping of waste from vessels into est@@ u@@ aries or the sea are controlled under different piec@@ es of legislation by different Depart@@ ments . 
The White P@@ ap@@ er high@@ lights the importance of recogn@@ ising the value of the coast . 
The responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20 . In the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors . 
Chapter 7 Protection of Coastal Resources 
The purpose of sections 3@@ 1 and 32 is to provide for the form@@ al@@ izing in law of such determin@@ ations and adj@@ ust@@ ments through the marking of boundaries on z@@ oning maps and endor@@ s@@ ements by the Registrar of De@@ eds .

It em@@ powers the Minister or MEC either to consider the appeal person@@ ally or to appoint an appeal pan@@ el to determine the appeal . 
Section 2@@ 3 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 deals with the management of such areas . This is intended to provide a mechanism

and is it not already covered by existing environmental legisl@@ ation@@ ? An@@ sw@@ ers to these questions are discussed below . 
The coastal zone is illustr@@ ated in F@@ ig@@ ure 1 and defined as the area com@@ prising coastal public property , the coastal bu@@ ff@@ er zone , coastal access land , 
on their specific sectors such as land@@ -@@ use planning , agriculture , water affairs , nature conservation and others . 
These national , provincial and municipal CM@@ P@@ s must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover ,

This is in line with the Constitutional imper@@ atives that government en@@ sures accountability , responsi@@ veness and op@@ en@@ ness . 
Section 5@@ 5 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish z@@ oning schemes . Section 5@@ 6 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal z@@ oning schemes .

Un@@ der the Bill , a person who car@@ ries on business may only do that in the persons own full name as recorded in an official form of identification , registered name or a registered alternative business name . Trade cat@@ alog@@ ues and circul@@ ars have to reflect that name , description of the business and statement of the place where it is carried on .
In respect of lay@@ -@@ b@@ ys it provides that suppl@@ iers are accountable for amounts paid by consum@@ ers for lay@@ -@@ b@@ ys , and that the goods remain at the risk of the supplier .
Cla@@ use 36 prohi@@ bits offering pri@@ zes with the intention of not providing them .
In addition , accredited consum@@ er protection groups have a right to be consul@@ ted in respect of any proposed industry code of practice , and any proposed regulations .
The Minister has authority to exemp@@ t certain categories of trans@@ action from that requirement .
R@@ ight to hon@@ est and fair dealing
The right to choose includes the right to decide whether or not to continue a commercial arrangement during the course of an agreement , and once it has expired .
Un@@ consci@@ on@@ able conduct , force , co@@ er@@ ci@@ on , un@@ due influence , pressure or harass@@ ment , unfair tac@@ tics or conduct is prohi@@ b@@ ited in connection with any marketing , supply , negoti@@ ation , collection or recovery of goods from consum@@ ers .
Persons who attend at a consum@@ ers place of business or residence to deliver or inst@@ all any goods , or perform any services , must wear satis@@ factory identification .
If goods are re@@ condi@@ tioned that has to be dis@@ closed , and if they have been imported without the benefit of the manufacture@@ rs war@@ ran@@ ty , that fact must be dis@@ closed .
A number of specific marketing and selling practices are prohi@@ b@@ ited , including ba@@ it marketing , negative options and re@@ ferr@@ al selling .
Sup@@ pli@@ ers are prohi@@ b@@ ited from requ@@ iring consum@@ ers to purchase b@@ und@@ led goods or services as described in cl@@ ause 13 , unless it can be prov@@ en that the b@@ und@@ ling results in economic benefit for consum@@ ers .
The right to equal access to the consum@@ er market
Sup@@ pli@@ ers are oblig@@ ated under the Bill to accept the return of waste goods that may not be accepted in the common waste collection system .
The right to equal access exp@@ ands on and is concep@@ tually linked to both the Bill of Rights and the Pro@@ motion of Equality and Prevention of Un@@ fair Dis@@ crimin@@ ation Act , 200@@ 0 . It protec@@ ts communities , dis@@ tric@@ ts , market seg@@ ments or popul@@ ations from being un@@ fairly discrimin@@ ated against with regards to access to goods or services of different quality or pric@@ ing .
Cla@@ use 3@@ 9 addresses the legal status of agreements between suppl@@ iers and persons who lack legal capacity to enter into such an agreement .
R@@ ight to be heard and obtain redress The Bill aims to make redress accessible , and to protect consum@@ ers from being victi@@ mis@@ ed if they act to en@@ force their rights .
It is not to dis@@ place or over-@@ ri@@ de more specific schemes of consum@@ er protection established in terms of any indu@@ str@@ y-@@ specific law .
Cla@@ use 6@@ 9 out@@ lines the available a@@ venues of redress , including the courts , alternative dispute resolution , and complaint to the Commission .
Con@@ sum@@ ers who are approached by direct mar@@ ke@@ ters often feel psych@@ olog@@ i-@@ c@@ ally pres@@ su@@ red to agree to a trans@@ action .
The Bill co@@ di@@ fies a number of fundamental consum@@ er rights , as discussed below .
The Bill see@@ ks to advance that right with the following provisions :
Un@@ reasonable trans@@ actions as described in cl@@ ause 48 are prohi@@ b@@ ited , as are un@@ just or unfair terms or conditions .
determination of steps to be taken to ensure the performance of a particular function by a provincial consum@@ er protection authority , in the case where no provincial consum@@ er protection authority has been established ;
In terms of cl@@ ause 6@@ 1 , a produc@@ er , distribu@@ tor or supplier of a good is strictly liable for any harm whol@@ ly or part@@ ly caused as a consequence of product def@@ ect or failure , with certain excep@@ tions .
It will also permit the common practice of dis@@ coun@@ ted prices for children , or for persons over a certain age , and will permit the continued use of separate facilities for different g@@ enders .
Fin@@ ally , cl@@ ause 6@@ 7 requires suppl@@ iers to return parts and materials remaining from maintenance work .
This Bill pro@@ poses to repeal several laws replacing them with a single Con@@ sum@@ er Protection Act , which will also give priority to its own procedures for enforcement and will modi@@ fy the common law in several respec@@ ts .
Because that sort of agreement is often not an exercise of free choice , cl@@ ause 16 establ@@ ishes the consum@@ ers right to can@@ ce@@ l such an agreement without pen@@ al@@ ty during a brief co@@ ol@@ ing@@ -@@ off period of five business days .
The Bill is intended to provide a general de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t regime of consum@@ er protection .
R@@ ight to fair , just and reasonable terms and conditions
The Minister may exemp@@ t certain trans@@ actions or services below a certain th@@ res@@ hold .
The Bill promo@@ tes consum@@ er acti@@ vis@@ m .
Me@@ an@@ ing of trans@@ action and consum@@ er
In order to enhance consum@@ er choice the Bill introduc@@ es a number of provisions that are aimed at assisting consum@@ ers to sel@@ ect goods or services on the basis of having examin@@ ed the goods and compared prices .
The right of consum@@ ers to priv@@ acy includes the right to accept , refuse or block any approach for the purpose of direct marketing .
To re@@ str@@ ain or correct the wor@@ st abuses in the area of the marketing of goods or services , the Bill introduc@@ es or re-@@ en@@ acts a number of provisions to address the following matters :
The Minister may prescribe the information or records that inter@@ medi@@ aries or categories of inter@@ medi@@ aries must keep .
It further requires the supplier to compen@@ s@@ ate the consum@@ er if the supplier is unable to produce the goods once the full price has been paid by the consum@@ er .
To this end , the Bill provides for the Minister to consult the Members of the Provincial Executive Councils responsible for consum@@ er affairs with respect to the co-@@ ordination and harmon@@ isation of the functions of the Commission and the provincial consum@@ er protection authorities ;
The right to dis@@ closure aims to ensure that consum@@ ers understand the terms and conditions of the trans@@ actions or agreements they enter into and are able to make informed ch@@ o@@ ices about the products and services they con@@ su@@ me .
A supplier or a person acting on his or her behalf is prohi@@ b@@ ited from making fal@@ se , mis@@ leading or dec@@ ep@@ tive representations in respect of any goods and services under the circumstances listed in cl@@ ause 4@@ 1 .
In addition , if the consum@@ er had informed the supplier of the use he wants to put the goods to , the consum@@ er has the right to exp@@ ect that it will be suitable for that particular purpose .
An om@@ bu@@ d , consum@@ er court or provincial authority that has resolved a complaint may record the agreement as an order , which must then be confirmed as a consent order by the courts .
The right to choose encomp@@ asses the consum@@ ers right to exam@@ ine goods .
The Bill im@@ poses an obligation on the supplier to issue aler@@ ts of any activity or facility that is subject to any haz@@ ard that could result in serious injury or death to consum@@ ers ;
Trade descri@@ p@@ tions applied to any goods must not be mis@@ leading , and must not be t@@ am@@ pe@@ red with . The Minister may prescribe categories of goods to which a trade description must be applied .
The Bill replac@@ es the current L@@ ot@@ ter@@ y Act scheme for regul@@ ating promo@@ tional competi@@ tions .
To this end consum@@ ers have the following rights :
Sup@@ pli@@ ers accountability to consum@@ ers
The Bill sets out standards for fair and responsible marketing and provides a general prohi@@ bi@@ tion against marketing that is mis@@ leading , fraud@@ ul@@ ent or dec@@ ep@@ tive , as described in cl@@ ause 3@@ 5 .
To further protect consum@@ ers , the Minister may prescribe certain days , dates and times during which it is prohi@@ b@@ ited to contact consum@@ ers for promo@@ tional purposes .
There is a prohi@@ bi@@ tion against over@@ selling and over@@ boo@@ king , which requires a supplier not to accept consideration for any goods or services unless they reasonably exp@@ ect to have capacity to supply them or intend to provide goods or services that are materi@@ ally different . Con@@ sum@@ ers have to be refun@@ ded in full with interest and consum@@ ers can also claim contrac@@ tual and consequ@@ ential dam@@ ages , including economic lo@@ ss@@ es .
The liability provided for in the Bill is in addition to any other liability of that person in terms of any law , and exten@@ ds to loss ar@@ ising from death , illness or injury , or loss or damage to any property .
Cla@@ use 5@@ 8 provides guidance to the courts with regards to how they should assess un@@ consci@@ on@@ able conduct , unfair , un@@ just or un@@ reasonable contract terms , or deal with prohi@@ b@@ ited contract terms .
If an adver@@ tis@@ ement or notice states that prices are subject to a reduction or sale price , cl@@ ause 2@@ 3 provides for a consistent application of such no@@ tices , so that consum@@ ers can better comp@@ are prices in a consistent fas@@ hi@@ on .
If the spons@@ or of a lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programme keep@@ s a register of members , the spons@@ or may increase the price of re@@ wards only after no@@ ti@@ fying the members .
or a f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ ee in terms of a f@@ ran@@ ch@@ ise agreement .
The definition of consum@@ er is extended to the actual users of goods or services , reg@@ ard@@ less of who actually may have conducted a trans@@ action or paid for the goods or services .
The Bill makes it compulsory to display prices for any goods that are displayed for sale .
The right to choose also includes the right of the consum@@ er to can@@ ce@@ l advance reserv@@ ations or book@@ ings , but suppl@@ iers may charge advance depos@@ its and im@@ pose reasonable cancellation pen@@ alties .
The d@@ ti beli@@ e@@ ves that consum@@ ers have a right , and need , to be able to as@@ certain the identity of the legal person with whom they are dealing .
or the Minister has conclu@@ ded that the existing provincial consum@@ er protection authority is unable to perform that function effectively .
Up@@ front dis@@ closure for preparing an estim@@ ate is also required .
Therefore , cl@@ ause 5 provides for the Minister to grant indu@@ str@@ y-@@ wide exemp@@ tions from the application of specific provisions of this Bill on the request of a relevant industry regul@@ ator , if the National Con@@ sum@@ er Commission advis@@ es that the specific industry scheme offers at least as much protection for consum@@ ers as they would have under this Bill .
The Bill recogn@@ ises the role of civil society in consum@@ er protection by providing for the support of any jur@@ istic person or association of persons that meet the set criteria as consum@@ er protection groups .
Con@@ sum@@ er Affairs Act , 198@@ 8 Trade Pr@@ acti@@ ces Act , 19@@ 76 S@@ ale and Service Mat@@ ters Act , 19@@ 6@@ 4 Bus@@ iness N@@ ames Act , 19@@ 60 Bus@@ in@@ esses Act , 199@@ 1 P@@ ric@@ e Control Act , 19@@ 6@@ 4 Sections 2 to 13 and sections 16 to 1@@ 7 of the Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ e Mar@@ ks Act , 19@@ 4@@ 1 Section 5@@ 4 of the L@@ ot@@ ter@@ ies Act , 1997 , and related regulations .
Cla@@ use 2@@ 6 sets out dis@@ closure requirements that inter@@ medi@@ aries who are not regulated under another law have to comply with .
Cla@@ use 1@@ 7 descri@@ bes cir@@ cum@@ -@@ stances under which a cancellation pen@@ al@@ ty may be considered un@@ reasonable .
notice or instruc@@ tions of safe handling of goods ;
In addition , it will allow suppl@@ iers to target their marketing to specific population groups to the extent that is reasonable , having regard to the goods and services being offered .
However , the supplier can exceed the original estim@@ ate if the consum@@ er in writing dec@@ lines the estim@@ ate or pre-@@ author@@ ises any charges up to a specified maximum .
Thus , depending on the context , a consum@@ er means a person to whom goods or services are mar@@ ke@@ ted in the ordinary course of business ; a person who has entered into an agreement or trans@@ action with a supplier ;
The Bill applies to goods or services whether promoted by a for profit business , or by a non-@@ profit entity , the State or enti@@ ties contracted by the State , including Public Pri@@ v@@ ate Par@@ t@@ ner@@ ships .
Sup@@ pli@@ ers of repa@@ ir , maintenance or replacement services cannot charge consum@@ ers for these services unless the consum@@ er was provided with an estim@@ ate which the consum@@ er has authorised .
The Bill regul@@ ates lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programmes by requ@@ iring spons@@ ors of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programmes to meet their obligations when lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty cred@@ its are ten@@ dered , prohi@@ bits offering inf@@ eri@@ or quality products or requ@@ iring the b@@ und@@ ling of re@@ ward goods or services with revenue products , requires a supplier to accept the tender of sufficient lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty cred@@ its as adequate consideration for goods and services at any time , subject to limited bl@@ ack@@ -out periods .
In addition , cl@@ ause 2 specifically provides that in case of a conflict between this Bill and any other law protec@@ ting consum@@ ers within an industry , the laws are to be enfor@@ ced con@@ currently , as far as possible , and beyond that , the law that provides the greater degree of protection for consum@@ ers is to prev@@ ail .
Cla@@ use 8@@ 2 establ@@ ishes a scheme for the development through consultation of industry co@@ des of conduct relating to consum@@ er matters , and provides for them to receive the force of law by being prescribed by the Minister .
If a third party has a legal claim over the goods , the supplier is liable to that third party , unless it can be shown that the supplier and consum@@ er col@@ lu@@ ded to def@@ ra@@ ud the third party .
Cer@@ tain agreements or provisions of agreements are listed as unlawful in cl@@ ause 5@@ 1 , and are vo@@ id from inc@@ eption ir@@ respective of the common law or provision of other laws .
The Bill aims to co@@ di@@ fy and improve on the common law by addressing unfair contract terms and provide consum@@ ers with remedi@@ es where there have been bre@@ aches of contract .
Cla@@ use 6@@ 3 provides that pre@@ paid certificates , cred@@ its and v@@ ou@@ chers remain negoti@@ able for up to five years , and that the supplier is oblig@@ ated to honour them when presented .
Cla@@ use 2@@ 2 out@@ lines the circumstances under which a document would be considered to be in pl@@ ain language , and the Commission may publ@@ ish guidelines for methods ass@@ essing whether a document satis@@ fies that requirement .
The Bill re@@ tains the existing prohi@@ bi@@ tions against fraud@@ ul@@ ent schemes and offers , p@@ y@@ ram@@ id and related schemes .
The d@@ ti beli@@ e@@ ves that large trans@@ actions involving large businesses and the State do not require the protection offered by the Bill because they would benefit from the fle@@ xi@@ bility of operating in an un@@ regulated market . Therefore , the Bill will not apply to trans@@ actions when the consum@@ er is the State , or any organ of state ;
New provisions in cl@@ ause 4@@ 5 aim to ensure fair@@ ness in a@@ uc@@ tions by regul@@ ating the participation of owners or their agents as b@@ id@@ ders , and requ@@ iring notice of any res@@ erve b@@ id or up@@ set price .
Cla@@ use 3@@ 3 establ@@ ishes standards for the conduct of cat@@ alog@@ ue sal@@ es , cl@@ ause 3@@ 4 regul@@ ates the use of trade cou@@ p@@ ons , and cl@@ ause 3@@ 7 regul@@ ates the marketing of work from home schemes .
The provisions regarding the criteria for , and registration of , business names have been re@@ vised , moder@@ n@@ ised and harmon@@ ised with pro@@ pos@@ als under discussion for criteria applicable to companies in terms of the Companies Act .
To enable consum@@ ers to exercise this right the Act provides for consum@@ ers to make a formal demand to a mar@@ ke@@ ter to dis@@ continue any such approach to that consum@@ er , and it cont@@ em@@ plates the establishment of an Ex@@ clu@@ sion Register either by industry or by the Commission .
The Bill will apply to most trans@@ actions in the ordinary course of business between parties within the Republic , to the promotion of goods and services that could lead to such trans@@ actions , and to the goods and services themselves after the trans@@ action is completed .
The Bill further sets out the matters over which provincial consum@@ er protection authorities have jurisdiction in respect of activities occur@@ ring or application by per@@ -@@ s@@ ons carrying on business exclu@@ sively within their provinces , including issuing , on behalf of the Commission , of compliance no@@ tices ;
Prov@@ isions that seek to limit the suppl@@ iers liability must be specifically and con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously brought to the attention of the consum@@ er , as out@@ lined in cl@@ ause 4@@ 9 .
or the interaction concerns the supply or potential supply of goods or services to or at the direction of the consum@@ er .
This includes f@@ ran@@ ch@@ ise trans@@ actions or agreements as described in cl@@ ause 5 .
Cla@@ use 14 establ@@ ishes the consum@@ ers right to can@@ ce@@ l a fi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ term agreement , limits the rights of suppl@@ iers to im@@ pose cancellation charges , and sets out rules governing the exp@@ iring of such agreements .
It provides that consum@@ ers have a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are intended , of good quality , in good working order , free of def@@ ec@@ ts , and use@@ able and d@@ ur@@ able for a reasonable period of time .
Cur@@ ren@@ tly contracts are regulated in terms of the common law .
Any repa@@ irs or maintenance cost above the original estim@@ ate has to be authorised by the consum@@ er .
Con@@ sum@@ ers have to be informed and provided with the identity of the agents or person and informed of their right to res@@ c@@ ind the agreement during the co@@ ol@@ ing@@ -@@ off period .
In terms of cl@@ ause 4@@ 4 , the consum@@ er has the right to assume , and it is an impl@@ ied term of every trans@@ action , that the supplier or less@@ or has legal right to sell or lease the goods for full title of the goods to pass to the consum@@ er .
Such a register would allow consum@@ ers to pre-@@ emp@@ tively block direct marketing approaches .
Cla@@ use 9 sets out a small number of well-@@ defined , long-@@ standing and wid@@ ely accepted commercial practices that allow differen@@ tial treatment of consum@@ ers of a particular sex , age or gender , and states that those practices are not to be construed as unfair discrimination , if the conduct is reasonable .
Ac@@ cred@@ ited consum@@ er protection groups may also en@@ force consum@@ er rights by comm@@ encing or undertaking any lawful act to protect the interests of a consum@@ er individu@@ ally or a group of consum@@ ers collec@@ tively in any matter or before any forum cont@@ empl@@ ated in the Bill ;
If two prices are displayed for the same goods , the low@@ est has to be charged .
a user of the goods or a recip@@ i@@ ent or benefici@@ ary of the services ;
Cla@@ use 32 out@@ lines standards to be ad@@ he@@ red to when suppl@@ iers engage in direct marketing .
In addition to their jurisdiction to he@@ ar a matter initi@@ ated directly by a consum@@ er , the courts have jurisdiction to he@@ ar appe@@ als against Tri@@ bun@@ al decisions , and may order suppl@@ iers to al@@ ter or dis@@ continue certain practices , award dam@@ ages against suppl@@ iers for collective injury to all or a class of consum@@ ers , to be paid to any person on any terms that the court might decide .
In addition , there is a general prohi@@ bi@@ tion against consum@@ ers being sub@@ jected to unfair discrimination when they are entering into a trans@@ action or agreement , and in all aspects of the conduct of the supplier towards the consum@@ er in the course of the trans@@ action .
The Bill identi@@ fies the following elements that make a trans@@ action a consum@@ er trans@@ action , and thus bringing it within the scope of the Bill if it is an interaction or agreement to inter@@ act between a consum@@ er and supplier in the ordinary course of the suppl@@ iers business , including in terms of any public regulation ;
If a complaint is made to the Commission , it will investigate , and may make a re@@ ferr@@ al to the Tri@@ bun@@ al , which may resolve the matter by making certain orders as cont@@ empl@@ ated in cl@@ ause 75 .
notice on how to in@@ hi@@ bit any risk associated with the use of goods , and to re@@ me@@ dy or miti@@ gate the effects , and provide for the safe disposal of the goods .
Un@@ der certain circumstances , as described in cl@@ ause 21 , goods or services delivered to or performed for consum@@ ers may be regarded as un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited , in which case the con@@ -@@ sum@@ er has no obligation to pay for them , and the return of the goods to the supplier is at the suppl@@ iers own risk and expense .
The Bill would hold suppl@@ iers accountable to consum@@ ers for any money or other property belonging to the consum@@ er , but held by the supplier under any agreement , including advance payments for services to be supplied at a later date .
However , this does not apply to used goods or im@@ mov@@ able property .
If a complaint ar@@ ises in an industry in which a stat@@ u@@ tory om@@ bu@@ d scheme is in place , the consum@@ er must pursu@@ e a resolution through that scheme before making a complaint to the Commission .
C@@ ause 60 creates a framework for industry co@@ des to be developed , establishing schemes of product safety monitoring and , if needed , product recall .
This Part aims to safe@@ guard the safety of consum@@ ers and to establish a regime of product liability , ir@@ respective of negl@@ igence on the part of anyone in the supply ch@@ ain , which currently does not exist in South Africa .
The Commission would have authority to order an investigation and recall of any dangerous or def@@ ec@@ tive products covered by any such industry code .
If a complaint under this Part is directed to the Commission , it will be referred to the equality court .
there is an exchange of consideration ;
R@@ ight to priv@@ acy
The Bill provides for a general right for consum@@ ers to receive goods that are of good quality and free from def@@ ec@@ ts , as described in cl@@ ause 5@@ 5 .
However , an excep@@ tion is allowed where the consum@@ er has been expres@@ s@@ ly informed of the condition of the goods and has expres@@ s@@ ly agreed to buy them in that particular state .
The d@@ ti beli@@ e@@ ves that having informed and active consum@@ ers will enhance market and price competition .
Any printed information , document or notice that the Bill requires a supplier to pro-@@ duce , provide or deliver to a consum@@ er must satis@@ fy the pl@@ ain language requirements of cl@@ ause 2@@ 2 .
The use of a th@@ res@@ hold will mean that the protection of the Bill will extend to small shop@@ -@@ keep@@ ers and other businesses , when they make rou@@ tine or minor purch@@ ases for the purpose of their business . However , des@@ pite those excep@@ tions , cl@@ a@@ uses 60 and 6@@ 1 , which deal with un@@ safe goods , will apply to all goods introduced to the market , even if they were the subject of an exemp@@ t trans@@ action .
facil@@ itation of settlement of any dispute between the Commission and any provincial consum@@ er protection authority ;
