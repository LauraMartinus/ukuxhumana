This hope has been a common message from our people whom we encoun@@ tered during our peoples budget campaign this year . 
Poverty al@@ leviation and empowerment - through broad@@ ening participation in the economy and nar@@ rowing the ga@@ p between the first and second economy 
Province of 
the President himself to set the following goals for government at a national level@@ : 
do not have a represent@@ ational process . As a result , most of them are under@@ capit@@ alised , in the same way that a fir@@ m is under@@ capit@@ alised when it issues fe@@ wer secu@@ ri@@ ties than its income and assets would jus@@ tify . 
The enterprises of the poor are very much like corpor@@ ations that cannot issue shares or b@@ onds to obtain new investments and finance . Without representations , their assets are dead capital . 
This is the my@@ st@@ ery of capital 6 / 2 0 0 7 B U D G E T S P E E C H 
In the next five years the government will invest nationally more than R@@ 4@@ 00 billion in infrastructure to create jobs and fight poverty . 
In cra@@ fting the budget pro@@ pos@@ als , we went to great leng@@ ths to l@@ ist@@ en to the vo@@ ices of the people across the province , particularly the poor , dis@@ em@@ po@@ wered , jo@@ bl@@ ess and homel@@ ess .

But we were proud to announce that the jour@@ ney had beg@@ un@@ ! This year the jour@@ ney to prosp@@ er@@ ity for all in the province continues . There will be no change in direction or our end destination .

This province will not lag behind in achiev@@ ing these national developmental goals . Thus in this years budget there is an increase in funding for all votes , including that of basic services and infrastructure provision . 
The provincial government has achieved positive results in its efforts to grow the economy and to achieve sustain@@ ably higher growth rates , in partnership with the private sector . 
As we reflect on the year gone and focus on the d@@ aw@@ n of a new year , I am reminded of the words of Alf@@ red L@@ ord T@@ en@@ nys@@ on in his dr@@ ama entitled THE F@@ O@@ RE@@ S@@ TE@@ RS when he sa@@ id@@ :

I will again close with the words of Alf@@ red L@@ ord T@@ en@@ nys@@ on@@ :

I thank you . 
My than@@ ks go to Si@@ ph@@ o Sha@@ bal@@ ala and his officials in Treasury , and to Ms F@@ ik@@ is@@ wa P@@ up@@ uma and her officials in Economic Development , 
I also wish to thank the officials in my departments who have assisted me in the task of fin@@ alising the budget documentation we table today . 
and to my team in the Ministry , now under the leadership of Ms Si@@ b@@ ong@@ ile S@@ he@@ zi . L@@ ast@@ ly , to my wife May and family for their support and understanding . 
For most recip@@ i@@ ents of the old age grant , this monthly transfer is their only source of income , which they rely on to buy food and other bas@@ ics . 
Over the next three years , the 200@@ 8 Budget al@@ loc@@ ates more money to extend social grants to men between the age of 60 and 6@@ 4 , 
Government origin@@ ally allocated R@@ 8 .@@ 4 billion to build and up@@ grade these stadiums . 
Bu@@ il@@ ding a new power station , Me@@ du@@ p@@ i , at L@@ ep@@ hal@@ ale . This will generate an additional 4 7@@ 8@@ 8 MW of electricity , 
Five stadiums are being upgraded 
The main changes to the budget for the next three years are@@ : 
Children who do not receive a grant may also be exemp@@ t from paying school fees , depending on their parents level of income . 
National Bud@@ ge@@ t@@ ? 
South Afric@@ as economy will be affected by this slow@@ down , but our economy has a strong foundation , the public finan@@ ces are sound , investment is ris@@ ing and the long-term out@@ look for growth is healthy . We will weather the storm . 
The old age pension , disability and care depend@@ ency grant grow from R@@ 8@@ 7@@ 0 to R@@ 9@@ 4@@ 0 a month 
A 7@@ 50 m@@ l bottle of w@@ ine will cost 9 c@@ ents more 
Many other government programmes support vulnerable households . Children who receive social assistance do not have to pay school fees . 
but is still healthy growth for a country such as South Africa . And most import@@ antly , we will continue to invest for the future . 
Because of these constraints and because of the we@@ aker global environment , our economy is likely to s@@ low down , growing at about 4 to 4 a year for the next three years . 
Con@@ struction of a pum@@ p storage project , In@@ g@@ ula , in nor@@ thern KwaZulu-Natal . In@@ g@@ ula will generate 3@@ 3@@ 1 MW of electricity by 20@@ 12 and an additional 9@@ 9@@ 3 MW by 20@@ 13 .

Return to service of three power stations that were in long-term storage - Cam@@ den , K@@ om@@ at@@ i and G@@ ro@@ ot@@ v@@ le@@ i - which jointly provide an additional 3 6@@ 7@@ 7 MW . 
Our economy has experienced its long@@ est period of economic expansion in over 50 years , growing by an average of 5 per cent a year for the last five years . Since 200@@ 1 , we have created about 1 .@@ 5 million jobs . 
S@@ hor@@ t-@@ term capacity expansion inclu@@ des@@ : 
Due to growing electricity demand , E@@ sk@@ oms age@@ ing plants are operated at maximum capacity , which often leads to equipment fail@@ ures and less electricity available to the national gri@@ d that powers South Africa . 
Social grant incre@@ ases and extension of our grant system 
Tot@@ al tax relief for individuals of R@@ 7 .@@ 7 billion 
We are planning health and dis@@ aster management , event operations , safety and security , volunte@@ er training and recruitment , environmental rehabilitation and waste management , event communication , legacy and cultural activities . 
R@@ 12 billion more for social grants 
As a result , we have been able to provide more resources for education , health , social grants , housing , policing , public transport , stadiums , roads and prisons . 
R@@ 7 .@@ 6 billion more for public transport , roads and railway infrastructure 
In addition , a total of R@@ 9 billion is allocated to public transport projects related to the World Cup . 
The 200@@ 8 Budget also makes provision to phase in a reduction of the age of eligi@@ bility for men from 65 to 60 years - which is the same for women . 
Together with reduced capacity when plants are sh@@ ut down for regular maintenance , this means that E@@ sk@@ om is not able to generate enough electricity to meet demand by households and industry . This results in power cu@@ ts . 
In 200@@ 8@@ /@@ 0@@ 9 , total spending on grants will increase to R@@ 6@@ 9 billion , which is 10 of total government spending .

such as old age and child@@ hood , or if they are disabled and cannot work . The available grants are the old age pension , the disability grant , the child support grant , the foster care grant and the care depend@@ ency grant . 
A reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 2@@ 8 per cent 
We are also taking steps to make government work better for the people , and to get more value for each rand spent . 
increase the number of prosecu@@ tors and magistr@@ ates , expand the capacity of prisons , encourage people to save electricity , and boo@@ st our trade and expor@@ ts . 
Cap@@ ital investment 
In@@ vest@@ ment in electricity 
A 3@@ 4@@ 0 m@@ l can of be@@ er will cost 7 ,@@ 2 c@@ ents more , and 
As the economy has grown , we have come up against some lim@@ itations . The shortage of skilled people , in@@ sufficient electricity , 
This is s@@ lower than the past five years , 
traffic cong@@ es@@ tion and cement shortages are all signs that the economy is re@@ aching its speed limit . To grow f@@ aster , we have to invest even more in skills , in infrastructure , in machinery and equipment , in roads and public transport .

Social grant incre@@ ases for this year are as follow@@ s: 
S@@ pen@@ ding high@@ lights 
Con@@ struction of two g@@ as@@ -@@ fired power plants - open cycle gas tur@@ b@@ ines in Mo@@ s@@ sel Bay and At@@ l@@ anti@@ s . These will provide an additional MW . 
The foundation of our economy is strong and will be tested over the next year or two . With the right policies and hard work from all South Africans ,

In February of each year , the Minister of Finance announ@@ ces governments spending , tax and bor@@ rowing plans for the next three years . This is called the national budget . 
Because of rap@@ id economic growth and proper management of the public finan@@ ces , government spending has grown rap@@ id@@ ly since 200@@ 1 , much f@@ aster than economic growth . 
A p@@ ac@@ ket of 20 ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ es will cost 6@@ 6 c@@ ents more 
L@@ ong@@ -@@ term capacity expansion inclu@@ des@@ : 
Ho@@ st cities will also receive funding of R@@ 6@@ 8@@ 4 million to conduct operations during the 200@@ 9 Con@@ feder@@ ations Cup and 20@@ 10 FIFA World Cup . 
This makes South Africa one of the worl@@ ds biggest sp@@ enders on social grants . 
All children under the age of 6 are entitled to free primary health care . All beneficiaries of social grants who are not members of private medical aid schemes are fully subsi@@ dis@@ ed to receive health services at public hospitals . 
Th@@ rough getting better results from public spending and through higher levels of investment , we can li@@ ft our economy towards a growth rate of 6 . 
F@@ u@@ el taxes will increase , as from 2 April 200@@ 8 , by 11 c@@ ents per lit@@ re 
E@@ sk@@ om has 2@@ 6 power stations with the capacity to generate 3@@ 7 7@@ 6@@ 1 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity in total . However , only 3@@ 5 4@@ 36 MW is normally available , with MW used exclu@@ sively during pe@@ ak times .

we can grow even f@@ aster and make a bigg@@ er difference to the lives of all of our people . 
Together , these investments will increase South Afric@@ as long-term capacity to provide power to homes and businesses . However , the electricity crisis also shows the need for all of us to cons@@ erve electricity and use it more effici@@ ently .

When the strategy is finalised , the local authorities that provide waste removal services will implement it . 
B@@ illed accounts allow you to use any amount of electricity or water . 
Free basic sanitation 
Free basic municipal services are services provided at no charge by the Government to poor households . 
Free basic water consists of at least a basic amount of 6 k@@ l of water per month per household . 
This amount may diff@@ er among municipalities and you should contact your municipality directly to find out exac@@ tly what the free basic water service is that they provide . 
They will be charged for additional use at the end of each month . 
Pre@@ -@@ paid accounts 
The services include water , electricity , sanitation and waste removal . 
To have electricity and water connected in your home or business premises , contact the municipality of the area in which you have a new home or business . 
These services are provided by municipalities and include a minimum amount of electricity , water and sanitation that is sufficient to c@@ ater for the basic needs of a poor household . 
In certain areas , the national supplier , E@@ sk@@ om , supplies electricity directly . 
Your application will be assessed and a decision be made whether you qualify for free basic services or not . 
Contact your local municipal offices . 
De@@ pen@@ ding on your municipal systems , you would be registered as eligible for Free Bas@@ ic Services support and be given credit or the necessary support , accord@@ ingly . 
Your municipality will send you a monthly statement show@@ ing the amount of electricity or water consum@@ ed and the amount of money that you must pay .

However , policies regul@@ ating the provision of basic sanitation and refuse removal are yet to be finalised by the relevant sector departments of Water Affairs and Forestry and Environmental Affairs and Tourism .
