national assembly is entitled to designate an executive deputy president from among the members of the assembly . if no party or only one party holds 80 or more seats in the assembly , the party

another party or parties , and any portfolio or portfolios which remain unallocated must be allocated to the party or parties concerned in sequence of the highest surplus . the president after

the exercise of a power referred to in paragraph , or of that subsection affecting a person who is not a member of the presidents party , the decision of the leader of the party of which that person is a member prevails ; and the exercise of a power referred to in paragraph or of that subsection affecting a person who is a member of the presidents party , the presidents decision prevails . if any determination of portfolio allocations is varied under subsection , the affected ministers must vacate their portfolios but are eligible , where applicable , for reappointment to other portfolios allocated to their respective parties in terms of the varied determination . appoint in respect of that portfolio a person who is not a member of the national assembly , as the minister responsible

for the purposes of the constitution or in the interest of good government . meetings of the cabinet must be presided over by the president , or , if the president so instructs , by an executive deputy president : provided that the executive deputy presidents preside over meetings of the cabinet in turn unless the exigencies of government and the spirit embodied in the concept of a government of national unity otherwise demand . the cabinet must function in a manner which gives consideration to the consensus-seeking spirit embodied in the concept of a government of national unity as well
