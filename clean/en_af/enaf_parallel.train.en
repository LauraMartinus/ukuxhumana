country by the immigration services of home affairs .? : they occupy rdp houses .fact : some of the south africans facilitate corruption through the issuance of fraudulently obtained south african green id and lease of houses to foreign nationals .areas and levels where xenophobia existsxenophobia exists within :communities .employment sectors .schools and institutions of higher learning .how does xenophobia reveal itself in south africa ?xenophobia is commonly expressed through :violent attacks against asylum seekers , refugees , migrants or immigrants .the rejection and undermining of different cultures , and religions of other nationalities .the giving of denigrating and insulting names to people of other countries .factors that contribute to the tensions between foreign nationals and local people .competition to access health , education , social grants and other social services .business rivalry .employment competition .lack of ubuntu ( the spirit of humanness ) .how can these tensions be avoided ?if south africans are unhappy about the levels of basic public service delivery , they must approach their elected representatives and hold them accountable .attacking foreigners is not the solution to resolve problems of accessing basic public services such as housing , electricity , water , education and health .foreign entrepreneurs and local businesses must be encouraged to establish mutual business cooperation or partnerships .alert the local immigration services about employers who unlawfully employ foreigners who are not in possession of valid permits .accept diversity and interact with foreign nationals .recognise that foreigners boost our economy and add to our diversity .why do people leave their countries and come to south africa ?people come to south africa for various reasons :asylum seekers and refugees seeking protection from the government of south africa because they fear persecution as a result of wars or political problems in their own countries .tourists coming to visit different places of interest in the country and thereby boosting our tourism industry and creating jobs .visitors who come to see friends or relatives .persons who come for business or foreign investment purposes .persons who come to work legally , such as mineworkers and professionals .persons who come to conduct research and charity work .students who come to the country to study .why does the government accept foreign nationals in our country ?south africa is engaged in international trade and it needs to cooperate with other countries for purposes of investment .the government acceded to a number of international treaties and conventions that protect the rights of human beings , whether they are citizens , immigrants , migrants , asylum seekers or refugees .are foreign nationals entitled to human rights ?yes , every human being irrespective of nationality is entitled to have their basic human rights observed and protected .people coming from other countries are entitled to human rights in the same way as south african nationals .they are entitled :to be treated equally before the lawto have their human dignity respected .to work as long as they have a valid permit that allows them to do so .to study as long as they have a valid permit .students are only allowed to perform part time jobs .to access public services such as health , education , and the justice system .when is a person called a legal or an illegal immigrant ?legal immigrants are in possession of valid south african documents or visas and are therefore staying legally in the country .illegal immigrants either do not have valid visas or permits or they use fraudulent documents or their permits have expired .what does the law say about illegal immigrants ?illegal immigrants are returned or deported to their countries of origin but in a manner that respects their human dignity .why do we have to challenge xenophobia ?xenophobia is against humanity and the spirit of ubuntu .it discourages integration .it promotes violence .it undermines democracy and the constitution .it discourages diversity and development .foreign nationals contribute to economic growth , especially in the professional , technical , mining , and tourism sectors .who is responsible for fighting xenophobia ?it is the duty of government , ordinary citizens , migrants , immigrants , asylum seekers or refugees to challenge xenophobia .how do we report incidents of xenophobia ?anyone is free to contact the counter xenophobia unit at home affairs ontel : ( 012 ) 810 7141 / 7102 / 6107 or send a letter to this address : department of home affairs , private bag x114 pretoria 0001 or visit us at 270

members of provincial legislaturesdear colleaguepandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009as the minister of health , i am personally writing to you regarding the above disease for two reasons :to give you information that will assist you personally to deal with the diseaseto request your assistance and personal involvement and that of your high office in effectively communicating key messages on influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009 within your community .the official scientific name of this disease is pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) 2009 .it started in mexico and the united states of america in april this year .it was initially known as swine flu because it was thought to have originated from pigs .now , it is understood that it is a mixture of human and avian ( birds ) elements .hence , the disease has nothing to do with the consumption of pork or pork products .it is now simply referred to as pandemic influenza or preferably by its official name , a ( h1n1 ) 2009 .since april this year , the virus has spread rapidly to 166 countries globally .in africa , it has so far spread to only 16 countries .at the time of writing this letter , the virus had affected 177 457 people ( laboratory confirmed ) globally with 1 457 confirmed deaths .in south africa to date , we have confirmed 2 844 cases with six deaths .after the fourth emergency committee meeting held on 11 june 2009 , the world health organisation ( who ) concluded that the criteria for a global pandemic had been met and the director-general , dr margaret chan , declared a pandemic ( phase 6 ) .this simply means that the disease has spread to countries in all regions of the who and was spreading very fast .however , i wish to emphasise that the declaration of a pandemic does not mean that the disease is virulent .it simply means it is spreading all over .on 6 july , the who described the spread of the pandemic within affected countries and to new countries as inevitable and unstoppable .fortunately though , while this may be so , they noted that most people who contract the virus will have mild systems .nevertheless , as health officials , globally and locally , we are still worried by the deaths that have so far occurred ( globally 0,8 and in south africa 0,2 of the affected people ) .the virus mostly affects individuals in the age group 10 to 29 years ― most of these individuals are in schools or institutions of higher learning .the who advised that countries must concentrate on mitigating the impact of the disease on communities .in doing this , effective communication is the key .mode of spreadthe disease is spread by droplet infection i.e. when an infected person coughs or sneezes , and you inhale the air into which they have sneezed or coughed .even if they cough onto a surface and you inhale the air around that you may get infected ) .symptoms of the diseasethe symptoms can be divided into three main categoriessevere .mild symptoms include :runny or blocked nosemuscle aches and paingeneral feeling of unwellness .the overwhelming majority of people worldwide have mild symptoms and will not need any specialised medical care .people with chronic heart or lung diseasediarrhoea and signs of dehydration .severe symptoms include mild and moderate symptoms plus :difficulty in breathing ( respiratory distress )blue lips , tongue or other parts of the bodysevere drowsiness and loss of consciousness .anybody with moderate or severe symptoms must seek and receive urgent medical attention .provincial spread of the diseasethe spread of the disease within our provinces as a percentage of the total infections in our country is as follows :the six deaths :western cape threeeastern cape onefree state onekwazulu-natal one .testing for the virusofficial testing is done by the national institute of communicable diseases , situated in gauteng and decentralised recently to the western cape .testing will be done on recommendation by a doctor .patients who seek care within the public health system should not be requesting a lab test .we note that this is currently the case in the private health sector but this is not recommended by the who .doctors should treat suspected cases in terms of protocols provided by the national department of health .treatmentthe treatment of choice is tamiflu .this should be prescribed by a doctor and is only recommended for those with :mild symptoms in the specialised risk categories as mentioned abovemoderate symptomssevere symptoms .mass treatment with tamiflu will lead to mass resistance to the drug and render it useless even for those individuals for whom it may be life-saving .closure of institutionsexperience throughout the world has shown that closures of schools and institutions of higher learning , shopping malls and workplaces has not been effective in stemming the spread of the disease .instead , it caused severe social disruptions .we advise that any learner , educator or worker with mild symptoms should stay at home .if there are many learners and / or educators staying away , then the affected institution should consult the department of education , which together with health authorities will advise on what course of action needs to be taken. forward .simple hygienedue to the mode of spread of the disease as mentioned earlier , the following simple hygiene is recommended :wash hands with soap frequentlycough or sneeze into a tissue paper or your sleevenever cough into your hands , rather cough into your elbowif you are forced to cough into your hands , don 't touch anything like door handles , windows , table tops or utensils until you have washed your hands with soapif you experience mild symptoms , stay at home and avoid contact with people .i wish to assure you that everything is being done by scientists the world over working with the who to try and produce a vaccine .if things go well , such a vaccine may be available within a few months .however , there is likely to be overwhelming demand for the vaccine with limited production capacity ― none of the capacity being in africa .i wish to thank you for taking time to read this letter to you , and also wish to thank you in anticipation of your active involvement in communicating and in mitigating the effects of the disease

the request fee and the access fee ( for notification of the decision regarding granting of access ) .a requester who seeks access to a record containing personal information about that requester is not required to pay the request fee .every other requester must pay the request fee of r35 ( payable to public bodies ) .the information officer must notify the requester ( other than a personal requester ) by notice , requiring the requester to pay the prescribed request fee ( if any ) and deposit ( if any ) before further processing the request .the requester may lodge an internal appeal , where appropriate , or an application to the court against the tender or payment of the request fee .after the information officer has made a decision on the request , the requester must be notified of such a decision in the way in which the requester wanted to be notified .if the request is granted then a further access fee must be paid for the reproduction and for search and preparation for any time required in excess of stipulated hours to search and prepare the record for disclosure .access to a record will be withheld until the requester has paid all the applicable fees .services available to the public and how to access themservicesthe clients of srsa have direct link with the department .however , it is advisable that departments responsible for sport and recreation at provincial level be contacted for province-specific enquiries and services .these provincial departments work closely and in a coordinated manner with srsa .the services of srsa such as mass participation in sport at community and school level ;

that sati had with naati ( the australian national accreditation authority for translators and interpreters ) , which allowed for the accreditation of translators working in minor foreign languages ,

take it as soon as you remember , but if you only realize when taking the next dose , do not take double dose .if you have forgotten to take the pills for two days or more speak to your clinic staff .why must i return to the hospital / clinic ?it is important that you must return to the clinic / hospital to collect the rest of the tablets and to have your hiv status checked .at this visit they will give you the rest of the pep tablets and will also check how you are coping .you should have another hiv test at 6 weeks ( 2nd return visit ) , after three months and after 6 months .this is very important to find out your hiv status .if you test negative each time it means that you did not contract hiv from the rape .seeking helprape is very traumatic .here are some contact numbers :national telephone numbers :aids help line : 0800 012 4322life line : 021 461 111local numbersthe pill diaryhere is an example of a pill diary .this person started on a tuesday 12th november and she recorded this as day 1 and filled up her diary .she also took her first pep pill in the morning and her second pill for the 1st day was at 7pm in the evening .she will continue to take the pills at about the same time everyday for next 28 days until 9 december .do the same for your pill diary .it is important that you use condoms for six months .your pep diary .use this to help you remember to take the pillsfill in day 1 on the first day you start the pills .tick off each time that you take the pill until 28 days of medication is complete .keep the diary in a safe place .sunmontuewedthursfrisatdaydate to return to the clinic ( 1st date to collect rest of pep pills )date to return after 6 weeks :date to return after 3 months :date to return after 6 months :your rights as victim of crimeif you have been a victim of crime the following rights as contained in the constitution and relevant legislation will be upheld in your contact with the criminal justice system :the right to be treated with fairness and respect for dignity and privacy .the right to offer informationthe right to receive informationthe right to protectionthe right to assistancethe right to compensationthe right to restitutioncomplaintskeeping in mind that you have the right to complain , you can contact the relevant government department or service provider if you have any complaints with regard to the service you are receiving , or if your rights are not being observed .role players in the criminal justice system that will ensure that your rights as a complainant are observed are the following :department of justice and constitutional development .department of social developmentdepartment of correctional servicesdepartment of healthdepartment of educationnational prosecuting authoritysouth african police servicehuman right commissionoffice of the public protectorindependent complaints commission .English|AfrikaansMalunga| IMIBUZO?Sibuze nje wena: questions@capegateway.gov.zaIsigama Esinokusetyenziswa | uMgaqo-nkqubo Wemfihlelo | Ilungelo LobuniniHOME|YOUR LIFE|TOPICS|PUBLICATIONS|DIRECTORIES |YOUR GOVERNMENT|TENDERS|JOBSisiXhosaAboutContactHelpAdvanced Search |Home > Directories > Services > Recreation & Sport > Funding & Support > Funding of Sport OrganisationsFunding of Sport OrganisationsDESCRIPTION:Financial grants are available to assist sport organisations in sport development.This encompasses:* promotion of community access to sport* improvement of the overall performance of individuals in sport* expansion of the equipment resource base* assisting athletes with national and international trips* creation of more opportunities for disabled athletes and their inclusion in mainstream activities* increase of the number of sport persons in formal sport activities* increase of sport and recreation federations hosting events in disadvantaged areas* improving the quality of sport development programmes run by federations.Funding is specifically made available for:* sporting facilities to improve the standard and use of existing facilities and build new and upgrade existing facilities* sport federations to assist in their administration and technical capacity, ensuring that sporting events occur in the province.There are three kinds of funding offered by the Department:1.

resources.Thus developers will be able to proceed without uncertainty about whether work will be stopped if a heritage resource is discovered.The permit system addresses a range of heritage resources:* archaeological* palaeontological sites and meteors* architecture* ethnographic and decorative art* graves and burial grounds, including ancestral and royal graves, graves of traditional leaders, and graves of victims of conflict* places of significant historical events, landscapes and natural features of cultural significance;* living heritage associated with heritage

Anti-Retroviral (ARV) Center Launched in GugulethuFirst Dedicated Anti-Retroviral (ARV) Center Launched in GugulethuPROJECTSSPEECHESPUBLIC ENTITIESFACILITIES3 March 2005SOURCE: Department of Health (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)The Western Cape Department of Health in conjunction with Crusaid, a UK based HIV/ Aids fundraising organization, is to launch the province's first dedicated Anti-Retroviral Treatment Centre in Gugulethu on Thursday 3 March 2005.The 'Hannan Crusaid ARV Treatment Centre' stands out as a pioneering site for anti-retroviral treatment (ARV) in South Africa.By the end of January 2005, the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health has 6 660 patients on anti-retroviral treatment at 31 sites across the province, exceeding the target set for the current financial year.The anti-retroviral treatment (ARV) programme proposes a family approach to the provision of antiretroviral therapy to the community by building on the existing HIV care network.It identifies suitable HIV infected individuals for ARV therapy as well as following up on their partners thus offering lifelong ARV therapy.The programme's aim is to provide treatment for people infected with HIV and pregnant women referred from surrounding clinics and the Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU) in Gugulethu.The centrally located center would thus function both as a treatment and a training center.The Hannan Crusaid ARV Treatment Center represents the overall progress of ARV rollout in the Western Cape, says Pierre Uys, MEC for Health Western Cape.ENDSIssued by:The

DurbanvilleUBUMEIINKONZOAMAPHULOIINTETHOUSHICILELOIZIXHOBOUQHAGAMSHELWANO11 uMatshi 2005UMTHOMBO WEENDABA City of Cape TownThe recent outbreak of avian botulism, commonly known as bird flu, in the Sonstraal and Vygeboom dams, which resulted in a moratorium on fishing in the dams being imposed, was the subject of a public meeting held in the Durbanville Council Chambers on Tuesday night, 8 March 2005.Various officials from the City of Cape Town, as well as a representative from Cape Nature Conservation, were also in attendance.Although the botulism appears to be currently under control, the general sentiment of the meeting was that fishing in the dams leads to unnecessary injury to the birds.Birds have been strangled with fishing line, and even found with fish hooks in their beaks, are often encountered at these dams.The meeting decided that the municipality be requested not to lift the moratorium on fishing, but to substitute it with a total prohibition on fishing in these dams.The Directorate City Parks and Nature Conservation considered the request and due to the multitude of problems related to fishing, agreed to the imposition of a ban on fishing at these dams.Therefore, no fishing is permitted at the dams and notice boards to this effect will be erected.The presence of Law Enforcement will be increased at these dams to ensure compliance.Hierdie

Government of the Western Cape Launches an e-Literacy ProjectProvincial Government of the Western Cape Launches an e-Literacy Project18 March 2005SOURCE: E-Innovation (Department of the Premier, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)On 17 March 2005, the Cape Skills e-Literacy Pilot Project was initiated with the signing of an agreement between the provincial government and bridges.org, an NGO focusing on promoting the effective use of information and communications technology (ICT) in developing countries to improve people's lives."In its iKapa Elihlumayo strategy, the provincial government has committed itself to building human and social capital, with an emphasis on preparing the youth for employment.With this e-literacy project, we are working to address this commitment in a very practical way," comments Dr Harold Wesso, the head of the Centre for e-Innovation, the provincial government unit in charge of this project.e-Literacy looks at the combination of computer literacy and information literacy."This means that we aren't just looking at teaching people how to use computers; we're also teaching them how to use ICTs to access, generate and evaluate information and knowledge", says Katherine de Tolly, the project initiator."e-Literacy is important because we live in an age where people increasingly have to have these skills in order to be able to participate in the economy."If e-literacy is not addressed, the digital divide is widened: those with access and skills benefit from technology and access to information, while those without are increasingly marginalised (e.g. excluded from jobs, and from participation in government processes and public discourse on the issues that affect their lives).The Western Cape cannot afford to ignore the imperative to equip its citizens with e-literacy skills; it faces the threat of being left further behind in the global information society if it doesn't.The Cape Skills e-Literacy Pilot Project will focus on developing training materials and doing training at various rural Internet access points in the Western Cape.Based on lessons learnt from these initial training sessions, a strategy for a broad-based e-literacy across the province will be developed.The training materials developed will be published as open content, which will mean that anyone can use and adapt them, be they NGOs, other governments, businesses or individuals.For further information, contact Katherine de Tolly.Tel: 483 5461Cell: 083 324 4043.Email: kdetolly@pgwc.gov.zaThe content on this page was last

Development Applications* Who handles land development applications?* How are applications decided?* Appeals & queriesWHO HANDLES LAND DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS?Local municipalities are responsible for handling development applications, such as applications for departures from building parameters or applications for rezoning or for the subdivision of land.Municipalities decide how to handle these applications according to legislation, policies and guidelines provided by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning.In a few instances, for example more complicated rezoning applications, the municipalities will refer applications to the Department for submission to the Minister for a final decision.The Department processes agriculture-related applications for the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture, the national Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board.The Department also processes mining-related applications for the national Department of Minerals and Energy, the national and provincial Departments of Agriculture, the national Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board.HOW ARE APPLICATIONS DECIDED?Before a development application can be decided in terms of land use planning legislation, the application must be subjected to various public participation processes and in some instances, the approval of various state institutions must also be obtained.If an application falls within a certain category of land change it is also referred to the Department.Applications are assessed in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act, 1989 to ensure that integrated environmental policy and planning considerations are addressed.The Department ensures that these applications are coordinated with other related applications namely: mining reports, land development applications and spatial and strategic plans.Once a development application has been reviewed in terms of environmental legislation, an authorization, permit or decision - whichever is appropriate - is issued.Only after the application has been reviewed in terms of environmental legislation may a decision in terms of land use legislation be taken.APPEALS & QUERIESOnce a decision has been taken by a municipality an appeal against the decision may be lodged with the Department for submission to the Minister.If you have a query about a development application you've made, it must be directed to the body to which you made the application.For more information, contact:Chris RabieDirector: Environmental ManagementPrivate Bag X9086, Cape Town, 8000Tel: 021 483 4796Fax: 021 483 3633Department of Environmental Affairs and

Minister Pierre UysVisit to the Phelophepa Health Train by Health Minister Pierre Uys22 March 2005SOURCE: Ministry of Health (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)The "`best", "cleanest" and "healthiest" train to visit the Western Cape stops over at Malmesbury for four days to provide Dental, Health, Psychology, Eyecare and medicines to the first of thousands of people during a three month trek through the province.The Phelophepa health care train, a hybrid name derived from Sotho and Tswana idioms meaning "good, clean health" is at Malmesbury station to provide services from the 22nd of March.Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, will visit the train at Malmesbury on the Tuesday, from 8 to 10am."I believe the Phelophepa Health Care train is a brilliant concept of the Transnet Foundation and an excellent community outreach project.It has been running since 1994 and has treated nearly 800 000 patients of whom 700 000 were children (in the Western Cape alone some 125 000 have been served) - an average of some 75 000 patients every year.He said organisations such as the Colgate Palmolive Foundation and Roche Products which sponsor the train's dental and health clinics, was another good example of government partnerships with the private sector.The services have been extended to include mother and baby-care, blood pressure tests, diabetic screening and cancer education and includes a pharmacy.The dental clinic has six dental chairs equipped to perform the cleaning and extraction of teeth.Three of the six chairs are also fully equipped to do restoration while a special X-ray unit performs X-rays of the mouth.The clinic has been expanded to include diabetic screening and cancer education and screening.Special attention is given to mother and baby care and also eating habits.The psychology and counseling clinic conducts workshops within the communities and at schools.Marketing agents have been to all the stopover centres six weeks prior to the train's arrival to inform communities of the services which will be provided as well as arrival dates.The train will be at Piketberg from 4 to 8 April; Elgin from 12 to 15 April; Worcester - 18 to 22 April; Robertson - 25 to 29 April; Ashton - 2 to 6 May; Swellendam - 9 to 13 May and Oudtshoorn from 16 to 20 May.The content on this page was last updated on 30 March 2005Home

the Western Cape)In terms of Section 4(5) of the Land Use Planning Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance 15 of 1985) the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning hereby gives notice as part of the process of drafting a Provincial Spatial Development Framework, that comments are invited on current documentation and proposals until 13 May 2005 at 12:00.The aim and purpose of the Provincial Spatial Development Framework (PSDF) are:* To align the PSDF with the National Spatial Development Perspective;* To spatially reflect the vision of how the Province should develop in the broadest sense;* To spatially integrate the strategies of the various sectors;* To provide a framework which promotes environmentally sustainable development (i.e. ecological integrity, social equity and economic efficiency) throughout the Province;* To ensure that these objectives are reflected in the provincial spatial economy;* To guide the spatial development of municipalities;* To serve as an information source and guideline to inform and direct land use management; and* To spatially reflect the interrelatedness between ecological, social and economic activity.To date preparatory documentation has been drafted through an inclusive process involving representatives of government, civil society, labour and business, and this documentation has been consolidated into one document.Public comment is now being invited on the draft proposals contained in the document.A copy of the document is available for scrutiny from Monday, April 11 at each of the District Municipalities (town planning component) and at the offices of the Director: Planning, Biodiversity Management and Coastal Management on the second floor, Property Centre, 3 Dorp Street (use entrance

> Projects > Business & Economy > Industry Sectors > Cape Access ProjectCape Access ProjectCape Access is a community development project which sees Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) as tools to be used in building knowledge and creating opportunities.Through this project, communities are provided with access to computers and the Internet, as well as skills to take advantage of these tools.20042007* Pilot Sites* e-Community Forums* Links with Other Projects* Funding* Phases of the Project* Contact DetailsPILOT SITESThere are 6 pilot sites for the Cape Access project:AreaFacilityBitterfonteinBitterfontein LibraryStruisbaaiStruisbaai LibraryOudtshoornBongulethu LibraryBambanani Multi Purpose CentreElimElim Primary SchoolGeorgeCornville Primary SchoolThe Cape Access programme is using both new and existing infrastructure to provide rural communities with access to information technology and the benefits that can be derived from this.By using existing computer centres in local schools and multi-purpose centres, Cape Access is helping communities to get the greatest benefit from these facilities.New computer centres have been installed in libraries in communities where there are no facilities or extra-facilities are required.The pilot sites situated in libraries are using the Smart Cape technology developed by the City of Cape Town for the Cape Town library access project (Smart Cape).This provides users with the ability to register online, create their own email accounts and access the Internet.Users are limited to 45 minute sessions at any of the five library computers.The MPC and school sites are using the existing technology at those sites.This may be upgraded in the future to provide users with email accounts.e-COMMUNITY FORUMSEach Cape Access site is centred around an e-Community Forum, consisting of various representatives from the community, including community leaders, community NGOs, facility representatives and interested community members.e-Community ForumChairpersonWestPoint.comCornelius OviesBua e-Community ForumAnneke KlopperUlwazi e-Community ForumThembeka NqcezaMatzi.comJoanny StuurmanElim e-Community ForumMartin SalliesGeorge e-Community ForumClive ZinkfonteinAn enormous amount of time and energy has gone into the consolidation of these forums, as research has shown that many other tele-centre initiatives have failed because they focussed too much on the technological issues and not enough on the human issues around acceptance, training and promotion.It is essential that communities play a leading role in defining what is required and how the project should operate.Communities also need to take responsibility for the sustained use of facilities.The e-Community Forums will manage access to the facilities as well as other logistical details.They are also charged with mobilising the community and will play a key role in training community members.LINKS WITH OTHER PROJECTSThe Cape Access project is part of a suite of e-society projects currently being delivered by the Centre for e-Innovation.These projects are interconnected and adopt a holistic approach to ICT and development.Cape SkillsTraining support will be provided to the e-Community Forums through the Centre for e-Innovation's Cape Skills e-Literacy project.The project will train members of the e-Community Forums as trainers who will in turn train members of the community.This initiative is being run in partnership with bridges.org.Cape GatewayCape Gateway is a channel through which citizens can get easy access to government information and services.Users of the Cape Access facilities will be introduced to the Cape Gateway portal and training will be provided on how to use the portal and other government online information services.Other projects that are interfacing with Cape Access include, RED Door, Library Business Corners and the Multi Purpose Community Centres.FUNDINGThe Centre for e-Innovation has provided funding for the Cape Access project until 2006.Additional support is provided by the City of Cape Town through the technology, expertise and experience built around the Smart Cape Project.Once the pilot project sites are fully operation and have been carefully assessed, the Cape Access model (as adjusted according to the assessments) will be rolled out to other communities.It is anticipated that additional funding will be raised for this rollout from funding organisations and business.PHASES OF THE PROJECTPhase 1 ( July 2004 - March 2005)* Initial research* Selection of pilot sites* Creation of e-Community Forums.Phase 2 (March 2005 - March 2007)* Monitoring and

Entries for category three - for those who sell to informal markets and are thus enabled to care for their family.4. The last category is for candidates who produce mainly for their own consumption, e.g. vegetable gardens.Besides great publicity and exposure for participants, they also become a rolemodel for others involved in agriculture or for those who may consider taking up agriculture as career.The closing date for entries and nominations for the Western Cape competition is 17 June 2005.Further enquiries

ProgrammesHIV/AIDS threatens productivity, profitability and the welfare of employees and their families.Workplace HIV/AIDS policies and programmes can play a vital role in raising awareness around HIV, preventing HIV infection and caring for people living with HIV.* HIV/AIDS Workplace Policies* Workplace HIV/AIDS Programmes* Best Practices and Guidelines* Provincial Government InvolvementHIV/AIDS WORKPLACE POLICIESAn HIV/AIDS policy is a written document that sets out an organisations position and practices as they relate to HIV and AIDS.The Function of an HIV/AIDS Workplace PolicyAn HIV/AIDS policy:* Defines an organisation's position on HIV/AIDS and sets out clear guidelines on how HIV/AIDS will be managed within the workplace.* Aligns the workplace response to the broader legal framework.* Ensures fairness.* Identifies and protects employers and employees' rights and responsibilities in the context of HIV/AIDS.* Sets standards of behaviour expected of all employers and employees.* Establishes consistency within the company.* Sets the standard for communication about HIV/AIDS.* Provides a good foundation upon which to build an HIV/AIDS workplace programme.* Informs employees about assistance that is available.* Indicates commitment to dealing with HIV and AIDS.* Ensures consistency with national and international practices.Key issues that companies should be thinking about in relation to HIV/AIDS policies.* Recognition of HIV/AIDS as a workplace issue because it threatens productivity, profitability and the welfare of employees and their families.The workplace, as an integral part of the community, has vital role to play in terms of prevention.* Promotion of equality and non-discrimination between individuals with HIV infections and those without, and between HIV/AIDS and other comparable health/medical conditions.* Creation of a supportive environment so that employees living with HIV are able to continue working under normal conditions in their current employment for as long as they are medically fit to do so.* Protection of the human rights and dignity of people living with HIV or AIDS – such protections are essential to the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.* Recognition of the fact that HIV/AIDS has a disproportionate impact on women – this should be taken into account in the development of workplace policies and programmes.* Recognition of consultation, inclusivity and encouraging full participation of all stakeholders as key principles which should underpin every HIV/AIDS policy and programme.* Recognition that HIV is preventable and that the workplace needs to promote effective prevention efforts.WORKPLACE HIV/AIDS PROGRAMMESAn HIV/AIDS workplace programme is an action-oriented plan that an organisation can implement in order to prevent new HIV infections, provide care and support for employees who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, and manage the impact of the epidemic on the organisation.Key elements of an HIV/AIDS Workplace Programme include:* an impact assessment of HIV and AIDS on your organisation* HIV/AIDS awareness programmes* voluntary HIV testing and counselling programmes* HIV/AIDS education and training* condom distribution* encouraging health treatment for STIs and TB* universal infection control procedures* creating an open accepting environment* wellness programmes for employees affected by HIV/AIDS* the provision of antiretrovirals or the referral to relevant service providers* education and awareness about antiretroviral and treatment literacy programmes* counselling and other forms of social support for infected employees* reasonable accommodation for infected employees* strategies to address direct and indirect costs of HIV and AIDS* monitoring, evaluation and review of the programme.BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINESFor best practices and guidelines, people can be referred to these following documents, companies and organisations (form "HIV/AIDS in the workplace requires holistic, proactive solutions", Stephen Kramer, 2001):* International Labor Organisation.An ILO code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work (Geneva, 2001)* The Department of Labour Code of Good Practice on Key Aspects of HIV/AIDS and Employment* International Confederation of Free Trade

HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes:* Facilitating and driving a Western Cape HIV/AIDS in the Workplace initiative, by mobilizing existing and possible new parties involved.* Targeting the big corporate employers in the province, in terms of making sure that HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes are in place. (Give advice on developing and implementation of HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes).* Researching the impact of HIV/AIDS on the Western Cape economy.* Examining what has already been done in the corporate world.Where good practices have been implemented the unit encourages firms to share what they have been doing well with other organisations and encourages media coverage of these initiatives.* Raising awareness and providing assistance to small business through the initiatives and successes of large firms.Organisations with less extensive programmes (SMMEs) can learn from the experiences (highlights and pitfalls) of business with established policies and programmes and can recognise the value of these initiatives.Research indicates that many small business owners feel powerless in the face of HIV/AIDS.They don't know the HIV prevalence amongst their staff, how to deal with an employee who is HIV-positive, or how to introduce HIV/AIDS awareness and education into the workplace.* Encouraging companies to buy the comprehensive HIV/AIDS toolkit, produced by South African Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (SABCOHA), in accordance with international best practice.This toolkit provides businesses, especially SMMEs, with a means of implementing cost effective workplace programmes.For more information contactThandi MziziTel: 021 483

Court* Training staff at the liquorice extraction facility in Dysseldorp* Establishing a dried fruit facility in Van Wyksdorp* Bitterfontein Medicinal HerbsHYDROPONIC FARMING IN BEAUFORT WESTA hydroponics tunnel has been set up in Beaufort West creating 14 permanent jobs for local residents.The project is a collaborative effort between the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, the Department of Social Services and Poverty Alleviation, the Beaufort West municipality, the CSIR and the Association of Intensive Plant Production at the University of Stellenbosch.The pilot project is expected to start making a profit in January 2004.The project grows herbs including basil, mint, dill, coriander, rocket and sorrel for local and international retailers.The first export shipment was flown to the UK in June 2003 to test the market there.EXPANDING THE WUPPERTHAL TEA COURTThe Wupperthal Tea Court was assisted in expanding its facility to increase its production capacity for rooibos tea.One hundred and seventy-one farmers from Wupperthal and surrounding communities currently participate in a program moving from wild harvesting to sustainable cultivation of rooibos for export to the world market.Growing rooibos organically is not particularly difficult and brings farmers a better price.As a result, all Wupperthal farmers are now growing rooibos organically.These small-scale farmers are producing 60-70 tons of rooibos a year.TRAINING STAFF AT THE LIQUORICE EXTRACTION FACILITY IN DYSSELDORPThe Dysselsdorp Liquorice Extraction Project is

for permits to drive on the beach for the purposes of scientific research, recreational use, tourism business and gaining access to private property if there is no other access road.The Department also handles applications for a licence to operate a boat-launching site.The applications are assessed in terms of the National Environmental Management Act, 1998, with specific reference to Section 24(7) of the Act, in respect of the investigation, assessment and communication of the potential impact of the activity being applied for.The Department ensures that these applications are coordinated with other related applications, namely: a lease agreement in terms of the Sea Shore Act, 1935, or an EIA application where construction below the high water mark is being applied for.Based on this assessment, a decision will be made by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning whether the activity being applied is authorised or not.The written decision is called a Record of Decision (ROD).This is a legal document setting out conditions required to protect human health and the environment.For more information, contact:Janette de JagerEnvironmental

Rural SubsidiesRural SubsidiesThese kinds of tenure are protected under the Protection of Informal Land Rights Act while land reform processes are implemented.However, people who don't have legal tenure are not able to access subsidies under the Housing Subsidy Scheme so a special subsidy has been developed.WHO CAN APPLY FOR THE SUBSIDY?The subsidy will only be granted to individuals whose informal rights are uncontested and who are unlikely to lose those rights during the current land reform process.In addition the individual must comply with all other qualification criteria specified in 3.1.1 of the User Friendly Guide.In terms of land held by a community, should an individual be granted a rural subsidy and then lose the rights to his or her land, a process has been put in place whereby the person can qualify for another subsidy.While the subsidy is called a rural subsidy it is not limited to rural areas only and is made available in urban areas as well.This form of subsidy is regarded as a subsidy of last resort as it is seen as desirable that secure rights of tenure are provided wherever possible.The subsidy can only be accessed on a project basis, but there is no minimum or maximum number of participants imposed.The Provincial Housing Development Boards are allowed to accredit implementation agents to identify, plan and implement projects in terms of this subsidy.The approved subsidy is paid to financial agents identified by the Provincial Housing Development Board who administer the disbursement of the funds.Rural subsidies may be used for any housing related purpose agreed with the Provincial Housing Development Board.The content on this page was last updated on 18 March 2004SA Management Development InstituteThe content on this page

and a reference number allocated.The Tribunal will conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the complaint relates to a dispute in respect of a matter which may constitute an unfair practice.An inspector may inspect the property concerned and compile a report if necessary.The Tribunal must, within 30 days of receipt of the complaint, determine whether the complaint relates to a dispute in respect of a matter which may constitute an unfair practice.If the complaint does not relate to such a dispute, the complainant will be notified in writing.If the complaint does relate to

(NEF)This service describes the functions of the National Empowerment Fund and how to access their spectrum of services.It is particularly relevant for the start up business person, however there are also very useful services for large corporates.* WHAT IS THE NATIONAL EMPOWERMENT FUND?* WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NEF?* HOW DO I APPLY FOR FUNDING?What Is the National Empowerment Fund?The NEF was established by the National Empowerment Fund Act of 1998 to promote and facilitate economic equality and transformation.The National Empowerment Fund (NEF) was re-launched in May 2004 by the Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa to re-focus and refresh these efforts.The NEF Trust operates under the umbrella of the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) and is governed by a board of trustees under the Chairmanship of the director-general of the dti, Dr Alistair Ruiters.Find out more about its history on the website.Its main objective is to become a catalyst in facilitating economic equality and transformation, thereby maximising the empowerment dividend.The passing of the broad based empowerment charter, government policy and other sectoral charters; and a deeper understanding of the current market needs led to the new mandate which resulted in the enhanced operational business pillars of the NEF.These are:* Advisory Services, which will oversee the consistent standardisation and application of the charters across the government and private sectors.* Corporate Transformation Services, which will sustain transformation targeted at corporate and regional levels on a specific basis determined by national importance.* Market Making Services, which will play a catalytic role in facilitating BEE investment opportunities that will ensure ownership sustainability and transformation within the HDP sector.* Group and Entrepreneurial Schemes, enterprise development and synergistic partnership formation to leverage offerings.What Is the Philosophy of the NEF?* NEF looks to finance BEE groups who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and add value to the transactions by maximising transformation.* The focus is on regional and community development to energise enterprise growth.* The NEF will also provide a BEE advisory service to both Government and the private sector to enable consistent charter application across all sectors.* NEF will have significant input into the development of strategy to maximise transformation in targeted areas and sectors in the economy.* NEF will assist rural communities in uplifting themselves through targeted offerings.* NEF will act as a medium for dialogue with the private sector on their corporate and industrial strategy for transformation and BEE.* NEF will act as mediator between the private, public and empowerment sectors on transformation and BEE objectives including enterprise development.How Do I Apply for Funding?The NEF's funding activities are currently focused under Entrepreneur Support, which exists in the Group and Entrepreneurial Schemes division (GES).This offering provides acquisition and enterprise finance to support historically disadvantaged South African entrepreneurs.Entrepreneur Support provides equity and debt funding in accordance with venture capital principles, within a development context.To access

I &gt Immunisation is SafeImmunisation is SafeDepartment of Health (The Government of South Africa)This fact sheet explains what measures are undertaken to ensure that vaccines are safe.IMMUNISATION IS SAFEEPI(SA) Fact Sheet* Introduction* Desease Burden Versus Risk* Vaccine Safety and Quality* EPI(SA) Vaccines* Immunisation Safety Project* Roles and Responsibilities* Challenges1. INTRODUCTIONWhen the World Health Organisation (WHO) began it's immunisation programmes in 1974, less than 5% of the world's children were immunised.Twenty-six years later, it increased to 75% of children.Millions upon millions of children's lives have been saved and the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been considerably reduced.While many diseases have disappeared from the public eye, paradoxically the debate about safety of immunisation is still very much alive.Lack of public confidence in immunisation programmes has resulted in a concomitant drop in vaccine coverage levels (in some countries by 25% by the mid 1990s).Global communications, increasing consumer awareness, greater scientific knowledge and more open debate about health matters have all contributed to greater public scrutiny of healthcare issues and more scepticism about the intrinsic value of immunisation.2. DISEASE BURDEN VERSUS RISKEmphasis on Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) rather than lives saved and a lighter disease burden have contributed to fanning emotional responses without necessarily balancing the facts.The number of groups that actively seek information and knowledge about the risks and benefits of medicinal products has burgeoned as one public health crisis leads to another.Vaccine-associated adverse events have drawn public attention and criticism.It appears that the public focus has shifted from acute risk of deadly diseases to longer-term concerns about quality, safety and equity.The risks of disease and complications resulting from withholding immunisation, should be communicated to parents and communities.Health care workers need also be reminded of the great benefits of immunisations.No child should be denied immunisation without serious thought as to the consequences, both for the child and the community.3. VACCINE SAFETY AND QUALITYOver the years, the WHO and its partners have deployed continuous efforts and resources to improve safety of immunisation.New delivery technologies including the auto-disable syringe (which does not allow re-use of the syringe) have been introduced.Each country has a National Control Authority (NCA) that assesses the quality of vaccines, whether locally produced or imported, and ultimately authorises or rejects their public use.WHO considers a vaccine to be of good quality provided that an independent NCA has controlled the vaccine in accordance with the requirements defined by the WHO.There should be no remaining problems related to the vaccine quality.All vaccines used within the national immunisation programmes should, as a minimum, meet the WHO quality requirements.4. EPI(SA) VACCINESVaccines are tested for safety and efficacy in clinical trials and then in mass trials before being registered and made available in South Africa.All vaccines are evaluated by the NCA in South Africa, namely the Medicines Control Council (MCC) to ensure efficacy, quality and safety prior to registration and approval for marketing.All vaccines used in the EPI(SA) Programme are manufactured according to strict safety guidelines.These vaccines meet World Health Organisation (WHO) standards of quality, safety and efficacy.Vaccine batches intended for use in the country are tested at the National Control Laboratory (NCL) in Bloemfontein, prior to release.After introduction into the immunisation schedule there is ongoing surveillance of safety and efficacy through trials and post marketing surveillance by the MCC, EPI Programme and Vaccine Suppliers.The EPI Programme in South Africa introduced a active surveillance system for Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFIs), 1995, in all the provinces.The purpose of the EPI system for AEFIs is to* improve the quality of immunisation services;* to increase public acceptance of immunisation; and* to ensure that any such event is handled in a way that is acceptable to the patient, the parents and the vaccinators.AEFIs may range from the common redness and soreness at the injection site, to rare, serious conditions such as the potential risk of a severe allergic reaction in 1:100 000 to 1:1 000 000 doses of measles vaccine.AEFIs may also be:1. Programme - related2. Vaccine - induced3. Coincidental4. Unknown5. IMMUNISATION SAFETY PROJECTIn order to keep pace with new science, new technology and public concerns, WHO has created the Immunisation Safety Priority Project, which will focus on:* ensuring vaccine safety from clinical trials through the point of use* research and development of safer and simpler vaccine delivery systems* expanded access to safe and effective delivery technologies and their disposal* identification and management of risks related to immunisationIn the heated debates that immunisation provokes, it is important to consider the risk/benefit ration and to put AEFIs into perspective.Vaccines are known to be among the safest and most cost effective health interventions.Reports linking immunisation to an AEFI that are later proven to be a coincidence and unjustified continue to occur.These unfounded reports which have not been fully investigated, have a potential to do a lot of harm to the image of the programme.Arguments against immunisation derive their power from unjustified scares and misconceptions.It is important to remember that the RISK of the DISEASE is far higher than the RISK of giving the VACCINE.6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESIt is the joint responsibility of governments, regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers and communities to report any untoward events related to immunisation.There is a need to respond with facts and empathy to the concerns of parents and communities.7. CHALLENGESThe approach requires a combination of a caring attitude towards parents and infants, up to date knowledge and a positive attitude towards immunisation.There is no need to be defensive about immunisation.It is a known fact that the vaccine-preventable diseases are severe and immunisation prevents them!New challenges in the field of vaccine development and vaccine safety lie ahead.More complex vaccines are being developed and tested that may require increasingly sophisticated screening and monitoring systems.At the same time, these vaccines should reduce delivery schedules, simplify delivery technologies and offer good price/benefit ratios in overall public health terms.Other than improved housing, sanitation and clean water supply, vaccines have had unparalleled success in reducing the incidence of death and disease.Paradoxically, this success may result in an undue emphasis on vaccine side effects.Risk communication offers a set of tools for explaining risks in proportion to benefits.When we refer to the safety of any drug, we are talking about relative safety, that is safety relative to the alternative of not using vaccines.The EPI Programme will continue to work with all partners to improve all aspects of immunisation, such as vaccine safety, training and work with the industry to improve delivery technologies.It is by improving the quality of health care and keeping in mind the benefits that preventive health measures such as immunisation can offer, that tomorrow's world will be a healthier place.The Department of Health will continue to promote the benefits of immunisation to all South Africans, all health care workers and the health care providers.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Expanded Programme on

> I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Can I Best Help and Support My Friend Living with HIV/AIDS?How Can I Best Help and Support My Friend Living with HIV/AIDS?Question: I am a close friend of a person living with HIV/AIDS.How can I best help and support my friend and at the same time also deal with the emotional effect and impact this has on my life and relationships?Answer: A diagnosis of HIV/AIDS affects more than just the individual.It may affect family, friends and even the community.The diagnosis and the knowledge of living with HIV may be painful and affect many areas of life: physically, emotionally, socially, financially and spiritually; it may put extra strain on individuals and relationships.As the support person your 'emotional stressors' may be similar to the person living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA).Feelings of anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, helplessness and ambivalence may arise and come and go at any time.These feelings are natural, but are hard to deal with.It is important for you to identify and know the overwhelming feeling you have towards your friend and find support to deal with it.In the context of the your relationship to the PLWHA on a day-to-day basis, withdrawal, conflict, codependency, resentment, role changes and sex may become issues.In the outside world, family, finances and stigma could impose extra burdens.It is important to remember that even though your needs and feelings may seem irrelevant compared to those of the loved ones, they should not take a back seat.They are of equal worth to the PLWHAs.If you do not deal with your own feelings and needs, they will only magnify, cause resentment and many other negative and hard to deal with emotions.The best way to handle them is to talk about them to someone you feel safe with.While you may be able to talk to some of your friends, this is not always possible.Friends may not always understand what you are going through.Also, you may have been sworn to secrecy and not be able to confide in your closest friends.Another place to talk through the difficulties, to share your experiences and find support from the sharing of similar experiences may be with a support group.This may be a safe place for venting unwanted and negative feelings for example, resentment, guilt, fear or even rage without feeling guilty, and without hurting anyone in the process.Apart from providing emotional support, support groups may also be able to help with networking, medical or care issues, financial problems, by, for example, starting a vegetable garden or learning beadwork skills, and child care or parenting skills.The PLWHA should also be encouraged to join a support group for people living with HIV for the same reasons.For the PLWHA to know that they are supported and accepted is vital.Simply by being there, listening, acknowledging confusion, touching, being silent, laughing and crying is sometimes the best that you can do.As a friend, you have the opportunity for an increased sense of sharing, increased appreciation of time together and deeper and more intimate and open levels of communication together.CONTENTS | < Previous Section | Next Section >CONTENTS: Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS* How Do I Tell my Daughter of my HIV Status?* Is Counselling Necessary before Having

tourist facility which comprises tourist attractions, tourist services, accommodation and special events.* A community or public service facility which consists of major traffic generators (such as a regional shopping centre) and minor traffic generators (such as a place of worship or licensing office).* A commercial or business service or product which is indicated by signs located alongside (but outside) the road reserve which are directed at drivers.You can make an initial application for road signage to your nearest Local Tourism Bureau (LTB).Based on the application details the LTB makes a recommendation.The details are then passed on to a higher tourism authority where more considerations and recommendations are made.Following the various investigation processes, a letter of recommendation can be issued and if the application is successful the sign can be erected.In general, the owner/operator of the facility pays for the provision of non-emergency tourism signs, e.g. for attractions or services.Provided that all the required information has been given promptly, the application consideration process should not be longer two months.The document, Guidelines and Application Form for Tourism Road Signage, contains an information sheet for application plus all the necessary forms.Applicants can obtain this document from their nearest LTB.Once you have completed the initial sections of the application form, you should return the documents to the LTB for consideration.For further information refer to the Provincial Tourism Facility Audit and Signing

Outbreak of Classical Swine Fever Remain in Force17 August 2005Press Release by the Acting Minister of Agriculture: Department of Agriculture Western Cape: Mr Pierre UysThe Acting Minister of Agriculture of the Western Cape, Mr. Pierre Uys has announced that the control of the outbreak of classical swine fever in pigs in the Hex River Valley and Worcester area has progressed very well.An estimated 1009 pigs died of the disease on the infected properties.To date a total of 1591 pigs of 97 owners were destroyed and buried and compensation paid at market related to the amount of R1,3 million.Surveillance activities are continuing to ensure that pigs that might be carrying the disease are detected without delay.All infected holdings have been disinfected and inspected by Veterinary Services personnel.This process is almost complete but the minimum required disease-free period will remain in place until 30th September provided no further infection is detected.No movements of pigs may take place without a permit issued by the Department of Agriculture of the Western Cape.An embargo on the restocking of farms where pigs have been removed and destroyed remains in force until 30th September.The Director of Veterinary Services of the Department of Agriculture, Dr. Gideon Brückner said that a national survey has also been launched by the National Department of Agriculture to detect if the disease is present in pigs elsewhere in the country.He expressed his appreciation for the excellent cooperation that was given by stock owners within the Hex River Valley as well as the support received from the Provincial Disaster Management Unit, the SAPS and the Provincial Traffic Department.Enquiries: Dr Gideon BrücknerControl Centre: WorcesterDirector:

Uys Visits Groote Schuur Hospital's Renal Dialysis Unit in Support of Kidney Awareness Week23 uAgasti 2005South Africa's kidney transplant programme is amongst the best in the world with a success rate equal to all leading organ transplanting countries, says Western Cape Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys.There is, however, a dire need for greater organ donor awareness."At present one third of our donors are living relative (family) donors and the rest cadaver donors.We would prefer 100% cadaver donors, but to achieve this, it is essential to promote a much greater public awareness regarding organ donation.Donors can also carry organ donor cards," says Uys.Kidney transplants at Groote Schuur Hospital are already at 58 this year compared to the 51 done last year.We can all contribute to help ease the burden on organ transplants at our hospitals by adopting a lifestyle minimising the risk of kidney disease.The most important steps to keep kidneys healthy include:* Giving up smoking.* Limiting alcohol: limit alcohol intake to two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.* Enjoying life: Reduce stress by doing things you like doing.* Good nutrition: Eat lots of fruit, stick to lean meat and avoid fatty foods.* Drinking water: Water assists in transporting nutrients around the body.Ministry of HealthWestern CapeTel: 021 483

Participation (Department of Economic Development and Tourism, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)This document contains tips from procurement officers in the Provincial Government on how to improve your chances of successfully bidding for government tenders.The following are common mistakes made when tendering:1. Always provide all of the information requested by in the tender application.Do not forget things like your tax clearance certificate and shareholding certificates.Note: out-dated tax clearance certificates are also not allowed.2. It is important that the calculations of tender prices is correct.Check and DOUBLE-CHECK this!3. Often, tenderers misinterpret the scope of the work.If you are unsure of anything in the tender ASK!4. Always SIGN your bid document.Unsigned documents are unresponsive and will therefore be disqualified.5. If you are an HDI, remember to claim your points.Points unclaimed are points lost!6. Make sure that you drop the tender into the right box, before the closing time.By law, no late bids will be accepted, not even 1 second past the closing time.7. If samples are requested, sufficient amounts must be supplied to enable the item to be evaluated under the appropriate technical or clinical conditions.Ensure that any requirements related to compliance with SABS specifications are met.Tips from the procurement officials:1. Always read through the bid documents carefully.2. Complete the document in full.3. Do a proper cost analysis when calculating your bid prices.Bids calculated too high or too low are considered unresponsive.4. Enquire about the bid and obtain all the relevant information before completing the tender document.5. Feel free to ask why you were unsuccessful so that you may learn from mistakes made.6. Make sure that you are able to meet all the requirements within the specified time and are able to honour your offer in the event that your bid is successful.7. Do not make any misrepresentations or false statements in your bid documentation.It is a legal document and therefore enforceable by law.8. Quality services and products will improve your track record and good standing with the department.Poor delivery creates a negative impression not only for your business but for all small businesses in general.Home > Topics > Public LibrariesPUBLIC LIBRARIESWestern Cape Provincial Libraries (Service)The public can access or borrow books, audio books, music CDs, videos, CD-ROMs, newspapers and periodicals at their local library. &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Public Libraries (Facility category)WebPALS: Online Library Services (Service)The WebPALS service accommodates libraries managed by the Provincial Government of the Western Cape and does not include the libraries that fall under the City of Cape Town. &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Library Business Corners (Service)Annual Report of the Western Cape Provincial Library Service (Annual Report)2002The content on this page was last updated on 22 June 2007Home > Publications > Public Information > S &gt Safety Tips for TouristsSafety Tips for TouristsTourism Safety and Signage (Department of Economic Development and Tourism, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)This leaflet provides visitors with guidelines and precautionary measures to ensure a safe and secure stay in the Western Cape.* Accommodation* Transport* In the Street* Sightseeing / Entertainment / Major Events* On the Road* OutdoorsThe content on this page was last updated on 30 May 2006Home > Directories > Services > Arts & Culture > ArchivesNational Automated Archival Information Retrieval System (NAAIRS)The National Automated Archival Information Retrieval System (called NAAIRS) is an online tool for searching archival inventories.These catalogues are a list of the available archival records housed in National Archives of South Africa facilities. &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;The content on this page was last updated on 26 March 2007Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Services > Arts & Culture > MuseumsPROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF THE WESTERN CAPE -

Multi-Drug Resistant TB Fact SheetMulti-Drug Resistant TB Fact SheetMulti-Drug Resistant TB, like "Ordinary" TB, can be prevented and treated.Early presentation to a local health facility and adherence to prescribed treatment will prevent further spread of the disease.Encourage everyone who is coughing for more than 2 weeks to be tested for TB and everyone on treatment to complete their treatment.* What is MDR TB?* How many people in the Western Cape Province are affected with MDR TB?* What causes MDR TB?* Can someone develop MDR TB without ever having been infected with "ordinary TB"?* Who is at risk of contracting MDR TB?* Is it easier to get MDR TB?Is MDR TB more infectious than "ordinary" TB?* What are the symptoms (complaints) of persons with MDR TB?* How is MDR TB diagnosed?* How can the spread of TB be prevented (including MDR TB)?* Can a person with MDR TB continue to work, and if not, are they eligible for a disability grant?* Is there a link between HIV/AIDS and MDR TB?* Can an HIV infected person or person living with AIDS take both MDR TB and Antiretroviral treatment at the same time?* What is meant by an "outbreak" of MDR TB?* In the case of an outbreak of MDR TB, how is further spread of the infection prevented?What is MDR TB?Multi-Drug Resistant TB (or MDR TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria (germs) that are resistant to the usual drugs used to treat "ordinary" TB.In other words, the normal drugs that we use to treat "ordinary" TB will not work.How many people in the Western Cape Province are affected with MDR TB?* The Western Cape Province has relatively low rates of MDR TB, compared to other provinces and elsewhere in the world.* Of all people who are diagnosed with TB for the first time, 1% (1 in 100) will have MDR TB, and of all people who are diagnosed with TB after having been treated for TB before, 4% (4 in 100) will have MDR TB.* The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks South Africa the 9th country in the world who notifies the most number of TB cases every year.* More than 44, 000 people were diagnosed with TB in the Western Cape in 2004,* This means that although the rates of MDR TB are low in the Province, there is still a large number of people diagnosed with MDR TB in the province each year.* On average between 450 and 600 new cases of MDR TB are diagnosed in the Western Cape annually.What causes MDR TB?MDR TB is caused by the development of TB bacteria, which have become resistant to ordinary TB drugs.This occurs as a result of inadequate or irregular management of "ordinary" TB, either by using inappropriate drug combinations or by using single drugs for "ordinary" TB, clinics running out of drug stocks, inadequate counseling of patients leading to patients not taking their treatment correctly (poor treatment compliance) or patients not returning for treatment (defaulting treatment).Can someone develop MDR TB without ever having been infected with "ordinary TB"?Most MDR TB will develop as a result of poor adherence to the treatment for "ordinary" TB; however it is possible for someone who has never had or been treated for TB before to be infected with bacteria that are already resistant to ordinary TB drugs, if they have had close contact with someone with MDR TB.Who is at risk of contracting MDR TB?Anybody who is exposed to someone with MDR TB may be at risk of developing it.Most people who have strong immune systems will not develop the disease, as their body's immune system can fight the infection.* Babies and children under 5 years of age (They will need to have treatment to prevent TB disease if exposed to someone with TB)* HIV infected persons* Malnourished persons* Persons living in overcrowded households/ public institutions like prisons* Persons whose immune systems are not strong due to other diseases e.g. Diabetes Mellitus, cancer and some medications* Persons with substance abuse problems e.g. alcoholism or drug abuse.Is it easier to get MDR TB?There is no evidence to suggest that it is easier to get MDR TB than ordinary TB.TB of the lungs is relatively more infectious than TB affecting other organs/ systems of the body, as the bacteria may be excreted and spread by air-borne droplets.What are the symptoms (complaints) of persons with MDR TB?• The symptoms are the same as for "ordinary" TB• A persistent cough for longer than 2 weeks.• The cough may be productive and blood stained, chest pain, loss of weight and loss of appetite and night sweats.How is MDR TB diagnosed?Once a person presents with symptoms of TB, or is found to be a close contact of somebody with TB, clinic staff will request the person to provide two sputum (spit) specimens (phlegm from coughing), which will be sent to the laboratory for testing under a microscope.In addition to the normal tests done for TB, additional tests called culture and sensitivity testing, are done on the sputum specimens of people suspected of having MDR TB.These specialized tests take three to four weeks to reveal growth of the resistant TB bacilli, and to see which drugs will work against the bacteria.In addition, chest X-rays may be done in certain circumstances to see the extent of any lung damage and for future monitoring of response to treatment.Can patients with MDR TB be treated and cured?MDR TB is more difficult to treat than ordinary TB, because the TB bacilli are resistant to the drugs used to treat ordinary TB."Second line" TB drugs are used, which are less effective and have more side effects.Treatment outcomes are not as good as those with drug sensitive TB, partly because MDR TB tends to occurs in people with extensive lung damage who have been on and off TB treatment a long time.If diagnosed early the chances of cure are much better.On average, less than 50% of people with MDR TB will be cured, and about 30% will die before completing treatment.How is MDR TB treated?Patients with MDR TB will have to take at least 5 different drugs, including a daily injection for 4 months 5 days a week.During this time most patients with MDR TB are admitted to hospital so that they can be closely monitored for adherence to treatment and to monitor any side effects.Thereafter patients will need to take at least 3 different drugs for a further 12 – 16 months 5 days a week.Thus, treatment is much longer than for "ordinary TB" (which takes between 6 to 8 months), and can go on for up to 2 years.The length of treatment is to ensure that the disease does not relapse.How can the spread of TB be prevented (including MDR TB)?When coughing or sneezing, any person and especially those with TB or MDR TB should cover the nose and mouth with a tissue to prevent air-borne spread of the bacilli.Patients should also avoid spitting into open air/ the ground.Good ventilation of households is strongly recommended, people are encouraged to keep all windows and doors open.If possible limit prolonged contact (includes avoiding sharing the bedroom at night) with persons with ordinary TB or MDR TB, while their sputum remains positive with TB or MDR TB bacilli.Can a person with MDR TB continue to work, and if not, are they eligible for a disability grant?When the patient is taking treatment regularly and once the sputum has been tested and shows that they are no longer excreting MDR TB bacilli, the person can resume working.If the patient is assessed and declared to be "physically incapacitated" by a medical doctor, they may apply for a temporary disability grant.Is there a link between HIV/AIDS and MDR TB?Infection with TB also increases illness and progression (morbidity) of HIV, including increasing the death rate (mortality) in HIV infected people.Thus it is extremely important for TB to be prevented and/or detected and treated as early as possible in HIV infected people.It is important to remember that even if someone is HIV positive TB can be treated and cured!Can an HIV infected person or person living with AIDS take both MDR TB and Antiretroviral treatment at the same time?The two treatments may be taken concurrently.Close monitoring by an experienced medical doctor is necessary for patients on both therapies.What is meant by an "outbreak" of MDR TB?By definition any disease outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of the particular condition than would normally be expected in the particular circumstances.The disease cases must be epidemiologically linked (that means that medical staff are able to establish definite links between the cases), as opposed to occurring by coincidence.In the case of an outbreak of MDR TB, how is further spread of the infection prevented?Once an MDR TB case is suspected, active case finding is undertaken, i.e. we actively look for all persons who may have contracted the infection before they present ill to health facilities.This is done to limit the potential spread of the infection by as yet undiagnosed persons.Sputum tests for MDR TB are done and appropriate treatment is offered to confirmed cases.At the same time, these persons should be removed from the community until they have received treatment and are no longer infectious.* TB Control Programme (Service)The content on this page was last updated on 5 January 2006Home > Your

Cape > News > Early Detection is the Key to Survive Breast CancerEarly Detection is the Key to Survive Breast Cancer18 October 2005The incidence of breast cancer among South African women is increasing, with more than 3 800 cases being diagnosed every year, says Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys.In a statement in support of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Uys says breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in this country.About 90% of patients survive for many years after diagnosis when breast cancer is detected at the early stages.The designation of October as "Women's Health and Breast Cancer Awareness Month" in South Africa reflects a nationwide drive by public and private healthcare structures to raise awareness of this debilitating disease.Risk factors for female breast cancer include early menarche (period), late age at first childbirth, a high-fat diet and certain genetic mutations.Other suggested risk factors include, to a lesser extend, high alcohol consumption, contraceptives use and the use of certain post-menopausal hormone replacement therapies.The risk of developing breast cancer among South African women (aged 0-74 yrs) is 1 in 31 females.Uys says health services the world over have come a long way in fighting this dreaded disease."Treatment is, however, expensive and every new facility this province gets to help us in our fight against cancer is welcomed.We have a new CT scanner at Groote Schuur Hospital and injected an extra R1 million for the treatment of mainly head and breast cancers."We do this because cancer patients often still have many fruitful years ahead with special treatment.We in the Western Cape are fortunate that we do have excellent cancer treatment facilities throughout the province, but if there is no early detection through regular examination, survival chances are drastically reduced," says Uys.Herman van der WesthuizenMedia Liaison Officer - Ministry of HealthThe

preparedness planning.ISIQALO:1 uJanuwari 2002ISIPHELO:31 uDisemba 2004The disaster management software programme will provide a mechanism whereby all applicable organisations will forward information to the Sub-directorate Disaster Management, which in turn will then co-ordinate the combined database as required for the establishment of the Provincial Disaster Management Centre.The software programme (GEMC3) can escalate an incident from a municipality to the next level of governance and has the capability to activate the relevant disaster management plan.Furthermore the system has the following capabilities:* Strong mapping and live vehicle and resource tracking capability.* Live video feed.* Log the impact of a disaster.* Create step-by-step audit trail of who has done what, when, as the disaster intervention is taking place.* Produce SITREP's for National Disaster Management Centre.One of the issues that have to be contended with is the connectivity between the municipalities and SITA's Openet Wide Area Network.Only once this connectivity has been established can the installation commence.The software programme has been used in several instances, namely:Grabouw Informal Settlement FireNumerous shacks were destroyed by fire at the Grabouw informal settlement in the Boland on Sunday 23 September 2002 and hundreds of people were left homeless.The 2003 Cricket World CupThe 2003 Cricket World Cup (CWC) was held in South Africa and participating teams competed on a number of cricket pitches across South Africa.The CWC organisers

potential hazards in the Western Cape.This project has the following outcomes:* To generate standardised user-friendly maps of natural and other hazards.* To present hazards in GIS (Geographic Information System) formats that can be linked to other provincial maps and information to improve planning and disaster management efforts.The use of computers and communications technology in manipulating and moving data, in a timely and efficient manner is recognised by the Provincial Government Western Cape.The DMIMS will offer a very important tool for planning, warning and responding

My lease expired a few months ago.How much notice must I give before I can move out?14. Can my landlord lock me out?15. Can my landlord refuse to return my deposit?16. Which laws govern rental agreements?17. Who can help me if I have problems with my landlord?18. How do I go about lodging a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal?19. How can I contact the Western Cape Rental Housing Tribunal?MUST I SIGN A LEASE WITH MY LANDLORD?A verbal agreement is as binding as a written lease.However, if a written lease is required for you to occupy premises and you refuse to sign it, there is no agreement and you can't legally move into the property.If you have rented a property on a verbal basis for some time and your landlord then asks you to sign a lease, you do not have to sign a lease with terms that are different to your verbal agreement.Rather, the landlord will have to negotiate new terms with you and secure your agreement first.Remember, it is always better for both of you to have your agreement in writing, setting out the terms and conditions of your agreement.This will go a long way to preventing later disputes.WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE ON A WRITTEN LEASE?* Your name* Your landlord's name* Your postal address* Your landlord's postal address* The address of the property being leased* The amount for which you will rent it* The amount by which the rent will increase (for example, by 10 percent when renewing the lease)* When the rent will increase (for example, if there is a rates increase)* How often rent is to be paid (for example, monthly)* The amount of the deposit, if any* Your and your landlord's obligations (For example, who is responsible for maintenance?Who will pay the water, electricity and rates bills?Usually, the tenant pays for charges related to consumption, such as water and electricity, and the landlord pays for charges related to the property, such as rates)* The conditions under which either you or your landlord can give notice to cancel the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not done, or if the tenant is in arrears with the rent)* The House rules, signed by both of you, should be attached to the lease.* A list of defects, drawn up at a joint inspection when you move in and signed by both of you, must also be attached to the lease.MUST I PAY A DEPOSIT?Yes, if the landlord asks for one and it is stipulated in the lease.If the terms of your original agreement, whether oral or written, did not include a deposit, you need not pay one if the landlord asks you to do so later.Changes to an agreement are only valid if both you and your landlord agree to it.WHAT HAPPENS TO MY DEPOSIT WHILE I'M LIVING ON THE PROPERTY?The landlord or his agent must keep your deposit in an interest-bearing account (or trust account, in the case of an agent) for the time you are living on the property.The full deposit amount, plus the interest earned, must then be returned to you when you move out less the costs of damages caused by you and any monies you may still owe to the landlord in terms of the lease.WHAT MAINTENANCE MUST THE LANDLORD DO?It depends on what your lease says.Usually, a landlord maintains the outside of the property and a tenant the inside.WHAT CAN I DO IF THE LANDLORD REFUSES TO MAINTAIN THE THINGS HE SAID HE WOULD?Lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.CAN MY LANDLORD ENTER THE PROPERTY WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?Your landlord has a right to enter the property to perform routine inspections and so on, but only after letting you know well in advance to arrange a time that suits you.You do not have the right to deny him reasonable access.CAN MY LANDLORD INCREASE MY RENT WHEN HE WANTS TO?No, the lease or verbal agreement determines when, and by how much, your rent can be increased.If the agreement does not specify an amount or date for an increase, the landlord has to negotiate the increase with you.Neither you nor your landlord can make changes to your original agreement without checking with the other party first.BY HOW MUCH CAN MY LANDLORD INCREASE MY RENT WHEN I RENEW THE LEASE?This is specific to the renewal terms of your agreement.If your agreement doesn't specify a reasonable escalation, your landlord has to negotiate an acceptable rent with you.WHAT CAN I DO IF MY LANDLORD SAYS I HAVEN'T PAID THE RENT WHEN I HAVE?It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord receives the rent, so it will be up to you to provide proof of payment (for example, a bank-deposit slip).If you can't, your landlord will be able to give you notice in terms of your agreement and seek a court order for eviction.It is your right, in terms of the Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999), to insist on a receipt for all payments if your landlord does not automatically supply you with one.A receipt must contain the following information:* The date of issue* The address of the property for which the payment is made* The reason for the payment (whether it's rental, arrears or a deposit)* The period of the payment (for example, the month for which the rent will be paid).If your landlord refuses to give you a receipt, lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.CAN MY LANDLORD TAKE MY POSSESSIONS IF I FALL BEHIND ON RENT?He has to obtain a court order first.Then the Sheriff of the Court will attach your property to the amount of the money you owe.If your landlord takes your possessions without a court order, it's theft and you should contact the South African Police and lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.HOW CAN I END MY LEASE EARLY?It depends on the cancellation clause in your agreement.If there is no such clause, the only way you can end your lease early without being in breach of contract is if your landlord agrees to it or if your landlord is in material breach of the lease (for example, by failing to maintain the outside of the property, as agreed in the contract, and this makes it impossible for you to remain on the property.But you will have to prove this, though).If your landlord has met all the conditions of the lease, you can still end the lease early but will yourself be in breach of contract.This means your landlord can demand the balance due by you for the rest of the lease period, and you may lose your deposit.Speak to your landlord before making a move: many are willing to allow subletting or to terminate a lease after a suitable notice period on condition that you find a suitable replacement tenant.If your landlord agrees to terminate a contract prematurely, be sure to get it in writing, outlining the terms and conditions of the termination.MY LEASE EXPIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO.HOW MUCH NOTICE MUST I GIVE BEFORE I CAN MOVE OUT?Check your previous lease for a renewal clause that outlines how much notice you must give in such a situation.If there is no such clause, then the two of you have, through your actions, effectively renewed the previous lease, on the same terms and conditions, and for the full period stated in the original agreement.This means that you will have to invoke the cancellation clause of the original lease, if there is one, in order to get out of the agreement.Without a cancellation clause, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your landlord one month's notice, in writing, before the lease expired. (So if you were nearing the end of a 12-month lease, you should have let your landlord know, in writing, at the end of the eleventh month.)CAN MY LANDLORD LOCK ME OUT?No. Your landlord must give you a duplicate key immediately if he changes the locks due to wear and tear or some other reasonable cause.CAN MY LANDLORD REFUSE TO RETURN MY DEPOSIT?A deposit is there to cover any money you may still owe your landlord, and/or the cost of repairs to any damage to the property, exceeding fair wear and tear, that you have caused.If your landlord retains your deposit and is unable to furnish you with proof of the costs he has incurred, you should lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal.To prevent this, be sure to follow these steps:* When you move in, inspect the property together and list, in writing, any existing defects.Both of you should sign this document and it must be attached to the lease agreement.* When you move out, inspect the property together again.Compare the new list of defects with the list made earlier.* You may be given a chance to repair the damage yourself, or you can agree that the landlord will do it.If the landlord does the repairs, you have the right to see all receipts for repairs paid for out of the deposit.* If repairs cost less than the deposit plus the interest accrued, your landlord will have to reimburse you the difference.Contact the Rental Housing Tribunal if you have problems.WHICH LAWS GOVERN RENTAL AGREEMENTS?* Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999)* Law of Contracts* Common Law* ConstitutionWHO CAN HELP ME IF I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY LANDLORD?The Rental Housing Tribunal.HOW DO I GO ABOUT LODGING A COMPLAINT WITH THE RENTAL HOUSING TRIBUNAL?Fill in the complaint form on the site and deliver it by fax, mail or hand to the Tribunal.HOW CAN I CONTACT THE WESTERN CAPE RENTAL HOUSING TRIBUNAL?Every lease agreement and rental situation is different.If you suspect that your landlord is acting illegally, consult the Western Cape Rental Housing Tribunal or a lawyer for advice.Tel:086 010 6166Fax:021 483 2060Postal Address:Physical Address:Department of Local Government and Housing* Dispute Settlement between Tenants and Landlords (Service)The content on this page was last updated on 25 July 2007Home > Publications > Public Information > V &gt Frequently Asked Questions for LandlordsFrequently Asked Questions for LandlordsInformation on the rights and obligations of landlords renting out residential property to tenants.1. Must I sign a lease with my tenant?2. What information must be on a written lease?3. How do I check a potential tenant's background?4. Should I ask for a deposit?5. What maintenance must the tenant Do?6. Can I increase the rent in the middle of a lease period?7. By how much can I increase the rent when I renew the lease?8. What can I do if my tenant has not paid the rent on time?9. What can I do if a tenant claims to have paid the rent, but I haven't received it?10. Can I take my tenant's possessions if the rent is in arrears?11. My tenant's lease expired a few months ago.How much notice must I give, if I want my tenant to move out?12. How do I evict my tenant?13. Can I enter the property without my tenant's permission?14. Can I change the locks and lock my tenant out?15. What can I do if the neighbours complain about my tenant?16. What should I do if I suspect my tenant is involved in illegal activities on my property?17. What can I do if the tenant has damaged the property?18. Which laws govern rental agreements?19. Who can help me if I have problems with my tenant?20. How do I go about lodging a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal?21. How do I contact the Rental Housing TribunalMUST I SIGN A LEASE WITH MY TENANT?A verbal agreement is as binding as a written lease, but if your tenant insists on having something in writing, you must comply.It is, however, better for both of you to have your agreement in writing to set out the terms and conditions agreed upon.This will go a long way to preventing later disputes, when it is your word against your tenant's.* Your tenant's name* Your tenant's postal address* The amount for which you will rent it out* How often rent is to be paid, (for example, monthly)* Your and your tenant's obligations (for example, who is responsible for maintenance?Usually, the tenant pays for charges related to consumption, such as water and electricity, and the landlord pays for charges related to the property, such as rates.)* The conditions under which either you or your tenant can give notice to cancel the contract (for example, if specific maintenance is not done, or if the tenant is in arrears with the rent)* The House rules, signed by both parties, should be attached to the lease.HOW DO I CHECK A POTENTIAL TENANT'S BACKGROUND?Speak to the tenant's current landlord for a reference.It's also a good idea to speak to previous landlords, as the current landlord may give a good reference as a way to get rid of an unwanted tenant, and to get a letter from your tenant's employer to verify his permanent position and income.You can also do an ITC credit check (call TransUnion ITC on 0861 482 482 or visit www.transunionitc.co.za).SHOULD I ASK FOR A DEPOSIT?Yes, it's a good idea to put it in the lease.Remember that the deposit must be put in an interest-bearing account for the duration of the lease and given back to your tenant, plus the interest it has earned, when the tenant moves out.If, however, your tenant still owes you money on moving out, or if the property has been damaged beyond normal wear and tear, you can use the deposit to pay for repairs or to cover the money owed to you.See WHAT CAN I DO IF THE TENANT HAS DAMAGED THE PROPERTY? for more on deposits.WHAT MAINTENANCE MUST THE TENANT DO?CAN I INCREASE THE RENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A LEASE PERIOD?BY HOW MUCH CAN I INCREASE RENT WHEN I RENEW THE LEASE?It depends on what it says in your contract.If your contract doesn't specify a reasonable escalation, you will have to negotiate an acceptable rent with the tenant.WHAT CAN I DO IF MY TENANT HAS NOT PAID THE RENT ON TIME?Technically, your tenant is in breach of contract.Refer to the breach clause of your contract (or, in the case of a verbal agreement, the agreed on terms for termination) and act on it.If you don't have a cancellation agreement, it is good practice to write a letter giving your tenant seven days to pay, failing which you will cancel the lease.WHAT CAN I DO IF A TENANT CLAIMS TO HAVE PAID THE RENT, BUT I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT?It is your tenant's responsibility to make sure that you receive the rent, so your tenant will have to show you proof of payment (for example, a bank-deposit slip).If your tenant can't do so, you can give your tenant notice in terms of your agreement and seek a court order for eviction.If you are satisfied that payment has, indeed, been made, you are then obliged in terms of the Rental Housing Act (Act 50 of 1999) to provide you tenant with a receipt.CAN I TAKE MY TENANT'S POSSESSIONS IF THE RENT IS IN ARREARS?You will have to obtain a court order first.The Sheriff of the Court will then attach your tenant's property to the amount of the money due to you.If you take your tenant's possessions without a court order, it's theft.MY TENANT'S LEASE EXPIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO.HOW MUCH NOTICE MUST I GIVE, SHOULD I WANT MY TENANT TO MOVE OUT?Without a cancellation clause, the best way to get out of the contract would have been to give your tenant one month's notice, in writing, before the lease expired. (So if you were nearing the end of a 12-month lease, you should have let your tenant know, in writing, at the end of the eleventh month.)HOW DO I EVICT MY TENANT?You can never evict a tenant yourself.You can only seek a court order to evict a tenant if your tenant is in breach of contract.To find out if your tenant is in breach of contract, check your agreement.There should be a clause saying what constitutes a breach of contract (for example, not paying the rent on time) and what your rights would be in such a case (in other words, cancel the lease without further notice).If your tenant is indeed in breach of contract, take steps to strongly urge your tenant to rectify the breach.If this does not work, take legal action - lodge a complaint with the Rental Housing Tribunal or seek the help of a competent attorney.CAN I ENTER THE PROPERTY WITHOUT MY TENANT'S PERMISSION?You have a right to enter the property to perform routine inspections and so on, but only after arranging with your tenant to do so at a reasonable time, and with reasonable notice.Your tenant does not have the right to deny you reasonable access.CAN I CHANGE THE LOCKS AND LOCK MY TENANT OUT?If you change the locks, you have to give spare keys to the tenant.WHAT CAN I DO IF THE NEIGHBOURS COMPLAIN ABOUT MY TENANT?Check if the tenant's behaviour is in violation of the House rules.If so, you may be able to invoke your lease's cancellation clause and give your tenant notice.Keep a paper trail of complaints and your actions as proof.WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK MY TENANT IS INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON MY PROPERTY?Report your suspicions to South African Police Services.It is also a good idea to add a clause to your lease stating that no illegal activities are to be conducted on the property, which would give you grounds to cancel the lease immediately.WHAT CAN I DO IF THE TENANT HAS DAMAGED THE PROPERTY?If you asked for a deposit, you can use the money to repair damages attributed to the tenant beyond normal wear and tear when the tenant moves out.Be sure to follow these steps:* When your tenant moves out, inspect the property together again, ideally no earlier than three days before the tenant moves out.Compare the new list of defects with the list you made earlier.* You may give the tenant a chance to do the repairs personally, or you can agree that you will do it.Hold on to receipts for repairs paid for out of the deposit.Your former tenant has a right to see them.* If repairs cost less than the deposit plus the interest accrued, you will have to reimburse your former tenant with the difference.WHO CAN HELP ME IF I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY TENANT?Rental Housing Tribunal.CONTACT THE RENTAL HOUSING TRIBUNALIf you need help managing your tenant, contact the Western Cape Rental Housing Tribunal or a competent attorney for advice.The office hours are from 8.30 am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.Home > Directories >

City of Cape Town > Services > Business & Economy > Business Licences & Permits > Business LicencesIn addition to business registration certain businesses are required to get a business licence in terms of the Businesses Act.A business licence is generally required for businesses that need to comply with health and safety regulations.Licences are required for the following businesses:* making or selling food which can go off* health or entertainment activities (including businesses offering saunas, massages, snooker, billiards, slot machines, night clubs, and cinemas).Your local municipality handles business licences and you can contact them for details on licensing procedures and the various health and safety regulations required for different kinds of business.Depending on the type of business, you may need to comply with the following requirements:* zoning* health* safety (particularly fire).If you comply with all the requirements, you will be issued with a licence.If not, you can apply for a 14-day grace period, during which you can make changes to your premises so that they meet the requirements.* Matzikama Local Municipality* Cederberg Local

&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;The content on this page was last updated on 28 October 2004Home > Your Government > City of Cape Town > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Police > Calling for Emergency HelpYou therefore need to dial different numbers for different government emergency services, unless you are in the City of Cape Town metropolitan area, which already has its own single emergency number (107).For an emergency that needs police response, you should dial 10111.For an emergency that requires an ambulance, you should dial 10177.For both of these you must be able to say where you are and why you need the emergency response.Both of these numbers can be dialled for free.In the City of Cape Town metropolitan area, you can dial 107 (at no cost from a landline or public phone) for ANY emergency or disaster.You must state the nature of the emergency (fire, mountain rescue, traffic accident, crime, etc.) and the operator will ensure that the right emergency response helps you.You should also be able to state where the emergency is.Dialling 107 from a cell phone won't work.To dial the Cape Town single emergency number from a cell phone, dial 021 480 7700.Normal cell phone charges apply.However, if you are calling from a cell phone you can dial 112 and you will be linked to your cell phone company's emergency call centre.A call to 112 on a cell phone is free and is even possible on a cell phone that does not have airtime (it should also be possible even if you don't have a SIM card).Emergency calls take priority and if the network is busy, other calls will be dropped to take your emergency call.The networks must, in terms of their licences, provide this access to five emergency services (fire, ambulance, police, sea rescue and traffic).The cell phone networks also have different special emergency services that you can dial in addition to 112 or as part of 112 dialling.Check with your network (Cell C, MTN or Vodacom) to find out what these are.*

Town.However, they do not investigate cases after arrests, as this is the function of the Detective Service of the South African Police Service (SAPS).They share traffic policing functions with the Provincial Traffic Service.The CTCP can be distinguished from SAPS (who wear blue uniforms) and traffic officers (who wear light blue uniforms) by their black-and-white uniforms with black-and-white check detail.Their cars and motorcycles are also marked with the black-and-white check detail.The CTCP was established on 1 December 2001 in terms of the South African Police Services Amendment Act 1998.In other cities, such as Durban and Johannesburg, the traffic services immediately became part of their city police services.In Cape Town, this is going to happen slowly and most traffic officers will become city police constables by 2010.Everyone who joins the CTCP has to have special training at the Municipal Police Training College in Philippi before becoming a city police constable.There is a committee called the Civilian Oversight Committee, which is responsible for making sure the CTCP operates properly.They also advise the head of the CTCP about his/her duties, and evaluate the performance of the CTCP.The Committee is made up of seven City Councillors and seven ordinary civilians.The CTCP have offices all over the city.They have two main offices, one in Cape Town and one in Mitchell's Plain, with Mitchell's Plain office being the only 24-hour office.The head of the CTCP at present is Mark Sangster.You can contact the Civilian Oversight Committee through Anton Visser on telephone 021 400 1405 or anton.visser@capetown.gov.za.To contact the CTCP directly:City of Cape Town City PoliceUnity Building, Polka Square, Town Centre, Mitchell's

that take place in the City of Cape Town - that is, the Cape Metropolitan area, Blaauwberg, Cape Town CBD, Helderberg, Oostenberg, South Peninsula and Tygerberg - are dealt with by the City of Cape Town's Municipal Traffic Departments.The content on this page was last updated on 18 March 2009Home > Your Government > City of Cape Town > Services > Transport > Traffic, Accidents & Road Safety > Traffic Fines: City of Cape TownThese include the Atlantis, Durbanville, Elsies River, Helderberg, Milnerton, Oostenberg, Ottery Hill and Parow Traffic Departments.Violations that take place in other areas are dealt with by the relevant municipality's Traffic Department.1.

Can I pay my traffic fine electronically?6. How much time do I have to pay my traffic fine?7. Can I contest a fine?8. What happens if I don't pay my traffic fine?WHERE CAN I FIND OUT IF I HAVE OUTSTANDING TRAFFIC FINES?Call Traffic Inquiries during office hours (Monday to Friday, 8am to 3.30pm) on 0860 034 637.If you would like a printout of your fine, you will have to go to the traffic department in person.If you suspect that the traffic department may be sending fines to an old address, please fax your new address (physical and postal), along with a copy of your ID, to Motor Vehicle Registrations on (021) 419 1676.Mark it for the attention of the Correspondence Department.Call Motor Vehicle Registrations on (021) 400 4900 if you need further information about this.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAFFIC FINES?There are two kinds of traffic fines: Instant Summons and a 341 Traffic Ticket.* Instant Summons is issued when a traffic officer pulls a motorist over to issue a fine for the following: a moving violation (for example, speeding or going through a red traffic light), a default on your motor vehicle (for example, a broken taillight), an expired motor-vehicle licence or for driving a vehicle without a driver's licence.* A 341 Traffic Ticket is issued when a motorist is caught violating a traffic regulation by camera (for example, when speeding) or when a traffic officer issues a ticket when the motorist is not present (this is the pink ticket issued for parking violations, expired licence disks and so on).WHERE CAN I VIEW THE SPEED-CAMERA PHOTO?To view your photos you will need to know:* The municipal district in which the photo was taken* Your vehicle registration number* The film number, which appears in the traffic fine.Camera fines that start with "2" can only be viewed at Parow Traffic, Oostenberg Traffic, Helderberg Traffic, Milnerton Traffic South Peninsula Traffic and Cape Town Traffic between 8.30am and 3pm.HOW CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?If you are paying before the due date, you can pay your traffic fine by cheque, cash or postal order:* Cheques and postal orders should be made out to City of Cape Town.* Payment can be made either in person at the traffic department (find the address at Municipal Traffic Departments) or mailed to:Private Bag X019Roggebaai8012* Given the levels of fraud and theft in the Post Office, it is not recommended to send cash by post.* If you are a First National Bank customer, you can also pay your fine at any FNB ATM using your fine reference number.If you wish to pay on or after the due date, you can do so by cash or bank-guaranteed cheque at the court mentioned on the fine (find the address at Municipal Courts).You will have to make the payment in person no longer than 14 days after the due date.On the fourteenth day, your case will appear in court.If you do not wish to pay your fine you will have to appear in court, in person, on your court date to argue your case.If you are not there to argue your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued.CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE ELECTRONICALLY?If you are a First National Bank customer, however, you can pay your fine at any FNB ATM using your fine reference number.HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE TO PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?Depending on whether you have been issued an Instant Summons or a 341 Traffic Ticket, you have between 30 days and four months to pay your traffic fine.An Instant Summons has a court date and you have 30 days from the date of issue to pay the fine at the traffic department or at the court mentioned on the summons.If you pay the fine on the date of your court appearance, you will have to pay it in person at the court.If you receive a 341 Traffic Ticket, you have 30 days before the Traffic Department will issue a "Notice Before Summons", after which you will have another 30 days before the summons will actually be issued.After the summons is issued, you have another 30 days to pay your fine to the Traffic Department.After the 30 days have passed, you have another 14 days of grace in which you can pay your fine at the court mentioned on the summons.So in total, you have approximately four months to pay your traffic fine after receiving a 341 ticket.CAN I CONTEST A FINE?If you plan to contest your fine send a letter stating your reasons, along with a copy of your fine, to the Gallows Hill Traffic Department.You can also fax the information to 021 421 6607.You should receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the traffic department within about three weeks.The Traffic Manager will then send your letter to the relevant court.The Public Prosecutor at the court will review the fine, which takes a maximum of two days, after which the letter and the decision will be sent back to the Traffic Manager, where it is re-captured.This process takes approximately three weeks.The whole process takes about six weeks.You can also contact the Public Prosecutor directly at the court that appears on your fine.If you have received a summons, you should contact the Public Prosecutor before the date you are due to appear in court.WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?If, for example, the traffic fine has been issued in error you may plead your case in court on the court date of your summons.If you do not go to court to argue your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued and you will be charged with being in contempt of court.* Municipal Courts* Municipal Traffic Departments* Traffic Fines: Frequently Asked Questions (Service)* Traffic Fines: Laingsburg Municipality (Service)* Traffic fines: George

MunicipalityCAPE WINELANDS DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY: OVERVIEWThe Cape Winelands District Municipality covers the Witzenberg, Drakenstein, Stellenbosch, Breede Valley, and Breede River / Winelands Local Municipalities.District municipalities administer and make rules for a district, which includes more than one local municipality.The purpose of district municipalities and local municipalities sharing the responsibility for local government in their areas is to ensure that all communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, have equal access to resources and services.This will help some local municipalities who don't have the capacity (finances, facilities, staff or knowledge) to provide services to their communities.It will also help to cut the costs of running a municipality by sharing resources with others.The 'richer' areas will help the 'poorer' areas.Some of the functions and powers of district municipalities include:* to plan for development for the district municipality as a whole* bulk supply of water that affects a large proportion of the municipalities in the district* bulk supply of electricity that affects a large proportion of the municipalities in the district* bulk sewerage purification works and main sewerage disposal* waste disposal sites for the whole district municipality area* municipal roads for the whole district municipality area* regulating passenger transport services* municipal health services for the whole area* fire-fighting services for the whole area* control of fresh produce markets* control of cemeteries* promoting local tourism for the whole area* municipal public works.WEBSITE: www.wcdm.co.zaThe content on this page was last updated on 25 August 2004Home > Your Government > Cape Winelands

Kapa > Iindaba > Statement by Provincial Health Minister Pierre Uys on Combating Diarrhoeal Disease in the Western Cape14 uNovemba 2005The summer is upon us and with the heat comes Diarrhoeal Disease, said Minister Uys today during a visit to Mitchell's Plain Community Health Centre.Minister Uys said the Western Cape Department of Health will combatdiarrhoeal disease and increase immunization in the province as part of its2005 Christmas Deliverables campaign.The disease peaks during Februaryand March.Diarrhoeal disease is especially prevalent in summer because of more flies and higher water infection.The highest incidence occurs in low income areas and especially in the informal settlements.Minister Uys said children under the age of two are especially vulnerable and mothers need to wash their hands regularly.The Department will combat the threatening diarrhoeal disease through the employment of 74 community-based workers trained in the IntegratedManagement of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy.These community-based workers are based in affected areas such as Khayelitsha and the Eastern Klipfontein sub-districts.In addition the Department has also employed and trained four coordinators in the IMCI-strategy.This IMCI-strategy was originally developed by the World Health Organisation and focuses on the child as a whole, rather than on a single disease or condition."Sick children often arrive at primary health care facilities with a number of sicknesses and have to be managed in an integrated manner at home and at the clinic" min Uys said.The aim of this intervention is to expand services in Khayelitsha with an additional service in Mitchell's Plain.This is in line with the Provincial Government's Ikapa Elihlumayo strategy as it forms part of building human capital and strengthening social capital.Minister Uys said by Christmas this year, a total of 134 community-based workers will assist and strengthen the Department's fight against diarrhoeal disease.Every year, about 12 million children in developing countries die before they reach their fifth birthday, many during the first year of life.Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to five main diseases: acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles, malnutrition, and malaria.Minister Uys urged mothers to wash their hands regularly."If your children have the disease they must be given fluids immediately to prevent dehydration," he said.There is a simple recipe of a mixture mothers can give to their children:* Wash a bottle and a spoon* Wash hands with soap and water* 1 Litre of clean water (if in doubt boil)* 8 teaspoons of sugar* Half a teaspoon of saltHome > Publications > News > Provincial Minister of Health, Pierre Uys, Opens Revamped Trauma Unit at Elsies RiverProvincial Minister of Health, Pierre Uys, Opens Revamped Trauma Unit at Elsies River3 November 2005A revamped trauma unit which practically doubles the capacity of the old unit, was opened by the Western Cape Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, at the Elsiesriver Community Health Centre this week."Our new six-bed trauma unit with its own waiting room, consultation chamber, dedicated chairs for asthma sufferers, new ablution facilities which can also accommodate the handicapped and which also has its own funeral parlour, is a far cry from the old four-bed trauma unit which was struggling to cope with the daily congestion," says Uys.The unit serves the communities of Elsies River, Matroosfontein, Leonsdale, Eureka, Clarke and Balvenie Estates, Epping Forest, The Range, Connaught Estate and Uitsig.After hours the unit also serves the entire Tygerberg sub-district - in total some 43 000 people.In addition to the upgraded trauma unit the health center was also equipped with a centralised oxygen system replacing the old mobile system, an intercom and a fire-alarm system."The upgrading of our health facilities in the province is ongoing, prioritising the facilities where the need is the greatest, with the ultimate aim of good health facilities accessible to all," says Uys.2009: JAN FEB MAR APR MAYThe content on this page

Minister Pierre Uys on strengthening Home Based Care Services in the Western Cape21 November 2005The important role of home-based care in the Western Cape Health Services was emphasised again today by min. Uys during his visit to health care workers at Citrusdal.Home Based Care is the provision of basic nursing care needs by formal or informal caregivers to sick people in the comfort of their homes.Amongst people who qualify for this care are those who have had strokes, who are living with HIV and Aids, who are physically or mentally challenged, frail older persons, or those who are terminally ill."Home-based care is not a 24-hour service and does not replace the family as the primary caregiver, but it is only meant to be a complementary and supportive service to prevent caregivers, who have no other option but to care for sick relatives from overworking themselves" says Uys.Community-based care is the care that people can access nearest to home, which encourages participation by people, responds to the needs of people, encourages traditional community life and creates responsibilities.Caregivers from the various organisations have to complete a home-based care course facilitated by the Department of Health.Continuous, in-service training is provided by the Department to ensure competence.The Directorate CommunicationsOffice of the Superintendent of Health, Western CapeDepartment of HealthHerman van der WesthuizenMedia Liaison Officer to the Minister of Health+27 483 26272009: JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNHome > Publications > Public Information > I &gt Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)This publication provides information regarding Sexually Transmitted Infections, including what to expect from a health care professional and risk factors.Free and effective treatment is available.Encourage your partner/s to go to the clinic for treatment as you can be re-infected and must then be treated again.Helpline: 0800 012 322Background* What are STIs?* How will I know if I have an STI?* If you suspect you have an STI, the health worker will do the following ...* Risk factors associated with acquiring or having an STI* How to use the male condomBACKGROUNDThe National Department of Health has a National launch for* CHOICE* condoms in June 2004 to increase awareness for prevention of unplanned pregnancy and management of STIs.This includes:* awareness of the symptoms and signs of STIs* importance of promptly seeking treatment for STIs* awareness of the availability of free, quality STI treatment in the public sector* awareness of the availability of free, quality male condoms from public clinics and hospitals and non-traditional outlets* importance of treating sexual partners.WHAT ARE STIs?Sexually Transmitted Infections are infections caused by germs that are passed from one person to another mainly during unprotected sex.Most symptoms are easily noticed and can be treated if reported early to the sister at the clinic.HOW WILL I KNOW IF I HAVE AN STI?You may have an STI if you have one or more of the following symptoms:* Discharge from the penis, burning or pain when passing urine* Abnormal vaginal discharge, smelly, itching, burning or painful urination* Mild to sever lower abdominal pain, sometimes fever, with or without vaginal discharge* Sore(s) or blisters on the genitals with or without painful swelling in the groin* Sores, itching of glands, penis pain* Scrotal swelling, with or without pain.IF YOU SUSPECT YOU HAVE AN STI, YOUR HEALTH WORKER WILL DO THE FOLLOWING:* History taking* Physical examination* Testing for cervical cancer, if necessary, according to protocol* Correct diagnosis* Treatment using the syndromic approach or referral if indicated* Health education* Counselling* Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT)* Partner notification slip/s issued and treatment* Condom promotion, demonstration and provision* Referral to other services as indicated (family planning, antenatal care, PMTCT, TB, HIV treatment and care etc.)* Record keeping (patient record, daily statistics).RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING OR HAVING AN STI* Any unprotected penetrative sex (anal, vaginal or oral: anal = highest risk;

targeted in particularly poor communities - will also receive meals for the duration of the programme.Contact: Minister Pierre Uys18 uNovemba 2005During a visit to Hermanus Hospital today Minister Uys said "well-functioning equipment is crucial to the delivery of quality health services" The Hospital received a new gastroscope worth R 120 000 and 3 infusion pumps worth R30 000."This December, as part of the Christmas Deliverables campaign, the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health will spend millions on medical equipment in an attempt to improve access to quality health services" min. Uys says this morning at the Hermanus Hospital.The Health system is set for a big boost with the purchasing of various state-of-the-art and much needed medical equipment such as a gastroscope, x-ray rooms and a colposcope that will offer top-class medical treatment to the affected facilities where there is a need for these equipment.In this financial year the Department of Health will spent close to R130m on new equipment.Min Uys said the new equipment comes just at the right time, as the Festive Season is upon us and through past experiences the health facilities are busier than usual as a result of more road accidents and violence.Home > Your Government > Swartland Local MunicipalitySWARTLAND LOCAL MUNICIPALITY: OVERVIEWSWARTLAND LOCAL MUNICIPALITYThe Swartland Local Municipality provides services to the following towns and their surrounding areas:* Yzerfontein* Moorreesburg* Malmesbury* Riebeek-Kasteel* Riebeek West* Abbotsdale* Kalbaskraal* Chatsworth* Riverlands* Koringberg.LOCAL MUNICIPALITY POWERS* Pass by-laws (local laws and regulations) about any of the functions they are responsible for.* Approve budgets and development plans.Every year a Municipal Budget must be passed that sets down how money will be raised and spent.* Charge service fees for using municipal services like water, electricity and libraries* Impose fines for people who break municipal by-laws, for example traffic fines or fines for littering.* Borrow money.The council can take out a loan for a development or other project and is permitted to use municipal assets as surety.LOCAL MUNICIPALITY FUNCTIONSThe Constitution confers the following areas of responsibility on local municipalities:Find out more information about the basic services offered by the Swartland Local Municipality or discover the municipal facilities that are available.The content on this page was last updated on 19 May 2004Home > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Darling Public LibraryDarling Public LibraryDarling, SwartlandSwartland Local MunicipalityChurch Street, Darling, 7345PO Box 54, Darling, 7345022 492 2237022 492 3217Swartlandmun@swartland.org.zaNicolet, SMUTSHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Darling North Public LibraryDarling North Public LibraryPrivate Bag X1, Darling, 7345M, ENGELBRECHTHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Greenville Public LibraryGreenville Public LibraryPO Box 5, Darling, 7345022 41 2237022 41 3217Home > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Malmesbury Public LibraryMalmesbury Public LibraryMalmesbury, SwartlandVoortrekker Road, Malmesbury, 7299Private Bag X52, Malmesbury, 7299022 482 2996022 487 9440Swartlandmun@Swartland.Org.ZaElsabe Van Der VyverHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Moorreesburg Public LibraryMoorreesburg Public LibraryChurch Street, Moorreesburg, 7310Private Bag X8, Moorreesburg, 7310022 433 1647022 433 3102Cecelia AtkinsHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Riebeek-Kasteel Public LibraryRiebeek-Kasteel Public LibraryRiebeek Kasteel, Swartland7 Plein Street, Riebeeck-Kasteel, 7307Po Box 53, Riebeeck-Kasteel, 7307022 448 1258022 482 2935Marita Du ToitHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Riebeeck West Public LibraryRiebeeck West Public LibraryRiebeek West, SwartlandPo Box 26, Riebeeck West, 7306022 461 2324R LucasHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Rosenhof Public LibraryRosenhof Public Library022 433 2246C AtkinsHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > Public Libraries > Wesbank Public LibraryWesbank Public LibraryAcasia Avenue, Wesbank, Malmesbury, 7299022 482 2996 Ext 2240Me LareyHome > Your Government > Swartland Local Municipality > Facilities > ClinicsSWARTLAND LOCAL MUNICIPALITY -

2006Pollution and Waste Management (Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Cleaner Production is changing the way we do and use things, by making them more efficient and causing less pollution and waste.It is based on the principle that prevention is better than cure.This can lead to fundamental changes in people's mindsets and their actions.This publication provides tips on how you can save energy, save water and minimise waste.INTERESTING FACTS" For every kilowatt hour of energy used almost one kilogram of coal is burned.""Water is a scarce resource and the Western Cape no longer has suitable places to build dams.""There will only be two operational landfills left in the next two years!A new landfill is being sought but will cost millions to build and no-one wants it in their backyard.""The world produces an average of 4 tons of CO2 per person per year, South Africans each produce 10 tons of CO2 per person per year."Directorate: Pollution and Waste ManagementDepartment of Environmental Affairs and Development PlanningTel: 021 483 2705Fax: 021 483 4425cbill@pgwc.gov.zaFIND OUT MORE ABOUT:* Why implement cleaner production in your home* How to save energy* How to save water* How to minimise waste* Helpful hints* Water-wise gardeningWHY IMPLEMENT CLEANER PRODUCTION IN YOUR HOME* IT SAVES YOU MONEY!* It conserves natural resources, like water* It reduces water and air pollution* It creates a healthy environment for you familyHOW TO SAVE ENERGY!The following are some examples of what can be done in your home to make it more energy efficient:1. Hot Water Geyser* Insulate the geyser by wrapping it in a geyser blanket and save R10 and R20 / month.* Install a timer on the geyser to avoid heating up water when you don't need it.This can save up to 20% on your electricity bill.* Install a solar water heater.This pays back in electricity saving over approximately 8 years and utilizes a renewable source of energy.* Particularly is you are building a new house, it is a sound economic choice.Estimated savings of 20-40% of the total electricity bill.2. Lighting* Use CFL's or LED's, which are more energy efficient, rather than normal incandescent lights for any lights which stay on longer than an hour or two per day-especially good for outside fittings which stay on all night.* Switch lights off when you leave the room.3. Heating your home* By insulating your ceiling you can save half of heating electricity.* Include passive solar features if you are designing a new house:* Enough north facing window areas* Roof overhangs of the correct length to keep summer sun out but let winter sun in* Installing ceilings, note that it is difficult to warm up a double volume house* Insulate your walls and floors well, or use thermally efficient building materials.HOW TO SAVE WATERThe following are some examples of what can be done in your home to make it more water efficient1. By reducing your toilet flush volume you can save 20% of your total water consumption with no reduction in convenience.Dual-flush or multi-flush systems can be installed.The dual-flush device has two fixed settings-a light setting for urine and a heavier one for solids.The multi-flush device lets you flush any amount you want-just lift the handle back up and the flush stops.2. By installing a system to pump grey water (from the washing machine, basins, shower and bath) to the garden, most households will eliminate the need for any additional garden watering.This can reduce your consumption by 35%.These systems cost around R4 500 to install, but will pay themselves back in water savings in about 2 years.3. Fitting low-flow showerheads will reduce shower water used by 50-75%.Various types are available depending on the level of user comfort desired.Showering is in any case more water efficient than bathing, even without these shower heads.4. Tap aerators reduce the flow in kitchen taps by around 50-75%.Normally much water from these taps flows straight down the sink without being used.HOW TO MINIMISE WASTEThe Western Cape is producing more waste than it can dispose of.The Average Capetonian produces 1.6 kilograms of waste per day.Water seeping through the landfills pollute the groundwater and the earth.The following points give you some ideas of what can be done in your own home to minimise the amount of waste that you produce.1. Recycle as much of your refuge as possible.The following products can be recycled: paper, glass, tins, plastic, organics and car oil.There are recycling depots at a number of schools or organistions.Contact your local municipality or telephone directory to find a recycler near you.Make use of a twin or trio bin system.These are household bins that have been separated into compartments to allow for easy recycling.Different recyclables can go into different colour coded compartments.2. Compost your organic material (kitchen and garden waste).Compost can be used in the garden by mixing it with the soil to improve the soil structure.It increases the amount of organic matter in the soil and provides nutrients that will assist the plants to grow.3. Re-use containers as much as possible and ensure that the goods that you buy are not overpackaged in plastic.If they are, complain!It raises awareness.* If you are decorating, chooses paints and varnishes that are solvent-free and organic.* Switch off your television instead of leaving it on standby-TV's on standby still consume a quarter of their normal power.* Make use of public transport or walk or cycle to work or to the shops.Driver a smaller car as this uses less fuel, releases less pollution and requires fewer resources to manufacture.WATER-WISE GARDENINGBecause gardens are often so water intensive, it is useful to look at principles of water-wise gardening.They are also lower maintenance than normal gardens.The following tips are taken from “Water-wise gardening” (DWAF and NBI, 1998):* Grow water-wise plants-generally the best suited plants are those indigenous to the area as they seldom need additional watering.* Group plants according to their water needs-this avoids wasting water on plants that don't need it.* Consider the quality and type of your lawn-lawns guzzle water, so consider reducing your lawn area.* Improve the soil and mulch- soil water-holding capacity is improved by higher organic matter content.Mulching (covering the soil with a thick layer of bark, compost, straw, etc) keeps the soil much more moist.* Plant in the right season-For winter rainfall areas, this is in autumn and early winter so the plants have a chance to develop their root systems before the dry season.In summer rainfall areas, it is spring and early summer for the same reason.* Water correctly-avoid watering during the heat of the day or in windy conditions.One of the best irrigation systems is drip irrigation-it uses 25% of water used by normal irrigation system with the same effect, and can even be placed under lawns.* Energy Saving Tips (Public Information)* Drive Smart - Save Fuels - Save Money (Public Information)The content on

said you can get an STI from having sex only once with an infected partner.There are more than 20 different types of infection, which can be spread through sexual contact.Some of these are syphilis, gonorrhoea (drop) and herpes.There are no visible signs of the illness in the early stages and it may take years before a person becomes ill.During this time the infection can be passed on to sexual partners.Minister Uys says one in every 10 sexually active persons in SA is infected with an STI.He said that if it is left untreated, STI's can cause :* infertility* cancer of the sex organs* abnormalities or death of unborn babies* damage to the heart and kidneys* mental illnessMinister Uys said people must know their bodies and seek medical treatment at our health facilities when they notice the following signs:* Abnormal discharge from sexual organs.Even a slight watery discharge may be an indication of an STI* Sores, warts or blisters around the sex organs, which may be painful orpainless* Swollen glands near the sex organsIf a person is diagnosed with an STI or notice some of the signs, he or she must* Inform all their sex partners if there are more than one (although this is not recommended) and get them to go for treatment as well, even if they have no signs of any infection* Take the full course of medicines and do not share it with their partner* That person must get his or her own medicine.If you don't take the fullcourse, you may think you are cured, when in fact you are notMinister Uys said to condomise is the best prevention."Always use a condom when you have sex, as that will greatly reduce your risk of getting an STI"Home > Your Government > Theewaterskloof Local MunicipalityTHEEWATERSKLOOF LOCAL MUNICIPALITY: OVERVIEWThe

from the local community.2009The Zenzele Road Maintenance Programme aims to create long term job opportunities for local communities.The programme is an initiative of the Community Based Public Works Programme (CBPWP) and aims to improve the existing roads infrastructure by employing community members to conduct routine and periodic road maintenance.The CBPWP works with municipalities to identify operational areas and set up projects.Projects in these operational areas are supervised by contracted Zenzele project managers.Local community participation is facilitated by the CBPWP through community meetings.Approximately 12 - 25 Community Development Workers (CDWs) are employed by the CBPWP for a 12 month period for each project.The CBPWP conducts a skills audit of prospective CDWs and appointments are strongly gender and youth-focused.CDWs are contracted to work for 60 hours per month and are provided with bicycles to access their work areas.Work activities include clearing alien vegetation, cleaning drains and culverts, removing litter and foreign objects from roads, repairing potholes and washing roads signs and hazard plates.Workers also report major repairs.Each worker is allocated approximately 1km of road.The CBPWP provides roads maintenance training for CDWs as well additional life skills and HIV/AIDS awareness training.Social Facilitators monitor CDWs and aim to identify future opportunities for them such as additional training, placement or entrepreneurial opportunities.Lundi LutyaTel: 021 483 5381Email: llutya@pgwc.gov.zaMkhululi

leNtshona Kapa > Iindaba > Klein Karoo National Arts Festival 2006Klein Karoo National Arts Festival 200629 uMatshi 2006Message By Western Cape Premier Ebrahim RasoolCultural festivals in the Western Cape have one thing in common: they serve as a mirror in which communities in our province can see themselves as diverse groups - all of them embedded in one opulent Western Cape mosaic.To really be able to build a Home for All in the Western Cape, it is important that we should open up to one another and create an environment in which we will be free to interact with other people.This is what makes arts and cultural as well as community festivals such as the Little Karoo National Arts Festival (known as the "KKNK") so valuable and enriching.We should continue to introduce and expose our people to the rich diversity of cultures, beliefs, practices and values in the Western Cape, and enable them to enjoy the pleasure of really beginning to understand one another and developing a deep appreciation for each other.That is why the Provincial Government of the Western Cape is continuing its support of iconic events and festivals such as the KKNK and other festivals in the province: these events are vital for discovering what is important to fellow Western Cape residents and for learning more about it.The image in the mirror is a fine one - let us make sure that as many people as possible get to see it and enjoy its beauty.I wish to thank the management, participating artists, sponsors, the community of Oudtshoorn and surrounding areas, and all other role-players for helping us build A Home for All.Our best wishes for another magnificent festival!Kind regardsEbrahim RasoolPremier of the Western CapeHome > Your Government > Prince Albert Local

Services > Government & Democracy > Municipal / Local Government > Municipal Services > Free Water and ElectricityFree Water and ElectricityGovernment has announced its intention of providing free basic water and electricity services for all.There is also an initiative to provide free sanitation services.FREE WATERBy July 2001, approximately 23 million people in South Africa were receiving Free Basic Water.The aim ultimately is to provide poor households with a basic supply of 6 000 litres of safe water per month free of charge.This might vary from municipality to municipality and you should contact your municipality directly to find out exactly what the free basic water service is that they provide.You are required to pay for water that is used over and above the free supply.For more information, contact your local municipality or contact:Simpiwe MashicilaDepartment of Water Affairs and ForestryTel: 021 946 3666Fax: 012 323 3877mashics@dwaf.gov.zaFREE ELECTRICITYFree electricity services are specifically targeted at poor households.These households will be provided with an small amount of electricity for free but they must pay for any electricity that is used over the basic service level.The proposed amount of free electricity is 50kWh per household per month for a grid-based system.This is the approximately the amount of energy needed for basic lighting, running a small black and white TV and a small radio, basic ironing and basic water boiling through an electric kettle. 50Wp will be provided per non-grid connected supply system for all households connected to the official non-grid systems.Users who have pre-paid electricity meters will be able see when the free electricity is used up and will be able to buy more electricity at their own expense.Users with credit meters will not be able to see easily when they have used up their units.They will be charged for additional use at the end of each month.Free Basic Electricity will be phased in from July 2003, after Municipalities have received their funds from the Department of Provincial and Local Government.For more information, speak to your local municipality or contact:The Director Electricity Policy Analysis and RegulationDepartment of Minerals and EnergyPrivate Bag x59, Pretoria, 0001Tel: 012 317 9519Fax: 012 317 9539David@mepta.pwv.gov.zaSANITATIONFollowing from the successful implementation of the Free Basic Water programme, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is now in the process of developing a National Free Basic Sanitation Strategy.This is being done with guidance from the National Free Basic Water and Sanitation Task Team, which is chaired by SALGA and co-ordinated by DWAF.The aim is to develop a flexible national strategy, which assimilates the vast knowledge and practical experiences from within the water and sanitation sector.When the strategy is finalised it will be implemented by the local authorities that provide sanitation services.* Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (The Government of South Africa)* Water Services Act (Act) (File type: pdf)*

RasoolEaster Wishes from Premier Rasool13 April 2006SOURCE: Premier of the Western Cape (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Easter is the holiest time of the religious year for our Christian sisters and brothers.It is a time rich in spiritual symbolism and tradition dating back to the earliest commemorations of the capture, trial, death and resurrection of Jesus.The build up to Easter starts on Ash Wednesday when ash from the palms used in the previous year's Palm Sunday procession is applied in the sign of the cross on the foreheads of Christians as a mark of penance.The 40 day period between Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday is called Lent and is observed as a time of self denial and spiritual learning.On Palm Sunday Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem is remembered, when crowds of poor people proclaimed him an earthly King and waved palms of welcome.Jesus was condemned to death by crucifixion by the religious and political leaders of the day.He carried his own cross to the Place of the Skull on the outskirts of the city where he was crucified with two thieves on Good Friday.Churches are stripped bare of ornaments at this time to rep resent the absence of Jesus.Christians remember the 'Seven Words of the Cross' and supernatural events of Good Friday with prayer vigils.A great sadness at Jesus' sacrifice to reconcile humanity to God prevails.Traditionally, hot cross buns which signify the crucifixion are served on Good Friday.On Easter Sunday however, Mary Magdalene's discovery of the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus from the dead is cause for great celebration and thanksgiving.Easter eggs are exchanged to symbolize the empty tomb.I wish all who will travel this spiritual journey of Jesus a time of great meaning and growth.Jesus is respected and loved by so many religions and teaches us that we gain much more by investing in a better future than seeking glory for a day.The content on this page was last

What is Suitable for Recycling?2. How to Recycle Waste3. What Paper Can I Recycle?4. What Glass Can I Recycle?5. Recycling Metal6. Recycling Plastic7. How to Recycle Electronic WasteThis will explain what paper, plastic, metal and glass can be recycled.Not all domestic waste products are suitable for recycling.This is a guide to help you decide what to take to your nearest domestic recycling drop-off depot, and what should go in the rubbish bin.Not all domestic recycling drop-off points accept every kind of all recycling materials.It is best to call ahead to find out what you can bring and check the hours of operation as they may change from time to time.a. RinseWash and dry any food and beverage containers such as wine bottles, food tins and beer cans.Don't throw your recyclable materials into the dustbin thinking you'll fish them out later.Rather have a separate bin (or bag) each for paper, glass, metal and plastic and throw the waste directly in it.c. Drop offWhen your glass, paper, metal and plastic bags are full, drop them off at the Recycling Depot that's closest to you.Each depot has its own system for drop-offs: some depots have demarcated areas for certain materials, while others have people on site to help you sort your waste.If you're uncertain, call ahead to ask.3. Recycling Paper and CardboardThe following types of paper can be recycled:* White office paper* Magazines and books (glossy magazines and inserts printed on glossy paper are recyclable, as long as nothing is laminated)* Newspaper* Corrugated cardboardThe following may not be recycled.* NO laminated or waxy paper (such as that often found in boxes used for tomatoes or bananas)* NO waxy paper ream wrappers* NO tetrapacks (fruit juice and milk containers that seem to be made out of paper, but are lined with foil and plastic)* NO punch confetti* NO carbon paper* NO stickers4. Recycling GlassThe following glass can be recycled:* Wine bottles* Food jars (used for jam, mayonnaise, tomato sauce etc)* Light bulbs, sheet glass, mirrors and Pyrex can be recycled, but should be stored separately as they are made of a different kind of glassNote: Rinse out and dry bottles containing the remains of foodstuffs and beverages.You can leave paper labels on the glass.The following metal can be recycled but note items with asterisk* Aluminium cooldrink cans* Food tins (these should be rinsed.It helps if you remove the paper label, too)* Lids of glass containers* Aluminium foil and foil packaging* Small metal items (such as staples, paperclips)* Paint and aerosol cans (leave labels on the cans as their contents are viewed as hazardous and recyclers need to know what was in them)* Old car body parts** Rusty garden furniture** Non-ferrous metals (anything made out of copper, aluminium, brass, stainless steel)**NOTE: Very few recycling depots accept these metal items.Call ahead to make sure.The following plastic can be recycled:* Food and beverage containers (hard plastic as used containers for ice cream, milk, juice, bottled water, soft drinks, milk, butter and margarine)* Household cleaner containers (hard plastic such as that used for cleaners such as Handy Andy, bleach, dishwashing liquid, fabric softener)* Plastic bags (soft plastic such as that used to wrap magazines, six-packs of beer or packs of toilet paper)NO cling-wrap can be recycled.7.

Speeches > Presentation of the Budget of the Department of the PremierPresentation of the Budget of the Department of the PremierBY: Mr Ebrahim Rasool, Premier of the Western CapeAT: Provincial Legislature17 May 2006SpeakerMy Colleagues in CabinetHonourable Leader of the OppositionHonourable Leaders of political partiesHonourable MembersActing Director-General, Heads of Departments, members of the new Senior Management Service corpsDistinguished guestsBooker Prize winning novelist, John Berger, writes about Antonio Gramsci and defines his most unique and enduring capacity in the following manner:The least dogmatic of our century's thinkers about revolution was Antonio Gramsci.His lack of dogmatism came from a kind of patience.He saw close-up, and sometimes directed the political struggles of his time, but he never forgot the background of an unfolding drama whose span covers incalculable ages.It was perhaps this which prevented Gramsci becoming, like many revolutionaries, a millennialist.He believed in hope rather than promises and hope is a long affair.1This sensibility underpins President Thabo Mbeki's assertion that South Africa is in its Age of Hope, and the Western Cape Province's Hope, that we are on the Threshold of Prosperity.This Hope is neither transcendental nor sentimental, but founded on patience and endless human practice.It locates each one of us within an unfolding human drama in which we shun both dogmatism and complacency.Our role in the drama is taking shape.When I delivered my first budget speech for the Department of the Premier in 2004, we set out to respond to the challenge of building a Modern African State by laying the philosophical foundations of the state as developmental.We understood that to depart from the kind of state that the Desai Commission warned us about was to orient the state towards achieving the objectives of the National Programme of Action and the Millennium Development Goals for our Province.I proposed to you then the blueprint of a state that was integrated in itself, cooperative in its relations with other spheres of government, responsive to its citizens and partners, and globally-connected for its relevance.In my 2005 Budget Speech for the Department of the Premier I warned that the path towards a Development State would require deep transformation.I proposed a process that would see the reengineering of the Centre of the State, in which that Centre would gather together a skills set, drawn from the best of those inside and outside of the Administration, capable of giving leadership, setting the policy agenda and driving the implementation of the strategy.Mr Speaker, in my third Budget Speech as Premier, I can report to this House that we have achieved both sets of objectives, and we are now ready to clarify the next scene of the unfolding drama of building and rewarding the Hope that Antonio Gramsci speaks about.We in this Province are not alone in this unfolding drama.We are part of a global concern that seeks to consolidate hope by defining a Shared Growth path - that which we call iKapa elihlumayo - and building social cohesion while nurturing diversity - what we envision as a Home for All.Recently I was invited to join a gathering of progressive world leaders convened by President Mbeki at the Progressive Governance Summit precisely because what we are doing in this Province resonates with the hopes of the world to find a path to social justice, economic equity and a way of living together in the face of terrorism, intolerance and marginalisation.Endless human practice, as Gramsci would have told such world leaders, would insist that the path to such a future is based on analysis, planning and strategy.Analysis, planning and strategy draw from the global to the local and inform from the local to the global.PGDS: The Foundation Stone of ProsperityIn the context of South Africa, our Province is required to fashion a Provincial Growth and Development Strategy (PGDS) out of the National Spatial Development Perspective and, in turn, ensure that the Integrated Development Plans of all local governments are in this single image.This ensures both coherence and allows us all to work tangibly to create a better life for all our people.Last year Minister Mufamadi's department published guidelines on what a PGDS is.According to the Guidelines,The PGDS is based on a long-term view of the province's development trajectory.Drawing on the NSDP and the MTSF and working within a sustainable development paradigm, the primary purpose of the PGDS is to provide a collaborative framework to drive implementation within the province.It is not a provincial government plan, but a developmental framework for the province as a whole.We are about to finalise what we think this developmental framework for the Western Cape is.It will be the raison'dêtre of my department and this government.According to renowned planning theorist, Prof Patsy Healey, it will introduce the most radical and far-reaching changes seen in terms of the approach we have adopted.She argues that:...strategy-making is a process of deliberative paradigm change.It aims to change cultural conceptions, systems of understanding and systems meaning.It is more than just producing collective decisions.It is about shifting and re-shaping convictions.3At the heart of the PGDS is the paradigm of shared growth and integrated development.As we proceed to engage our social partners and the citizenry at large over the next few months, I believe we will be able to make this development paradigm hegemonic, not least because its seeds have already been sown by the iKapa Elihlumayo processes that have unfolded over the past few years, including the Growth and Development Summit of 2003.The PGDS argues that in the context of massive unemployment, perverse income inequalities, deep social divides and the potential marginalisation of our national economy from the global economy, our priority must be the achievement of much higher rates of growth as the springboard for dealing with the range of intractable challenges we face.Higher rates of growth on their own are not sufficient; it is the nature of growth that is critical.We must ensure that higher rates of growth are combined with greater social equity that will enable the poor and economically excluded to gain the means to participate in the economy and build their own sources of empowerment, combined with effective protection of the natural resource base of the province.Lastly, growth must not worsen spatial apartheid and inefficiencies, as it has in the first decade of freedom.It must make life more convenient and affordable for the majority of our people who are desperate to access economic, social and ecological opportunities.The PGDS - iKapa elihlumayo - sets out how our Province will achieve a shared growth and integrated development path.Following the logic of acupuncture, it will entail more targeted action, more strategic investment, better leadership and greater effectiveness and co-operation from government in the Western Cape.The PGDS is the further evolution of that which has already been brought to this House in the form of the eight iKapa elihlumayo strategies: Spatial Development, Social Capital, Human Capital, Micro-Economic, Strategic Infrastructure, and the three Governance Strategies.These will now need refocusing so that, in turn, they achieve the practical objectives I set out in my State of the Province Address earlier this year as the Battle Plan for Shared Growth.They are, by way of reminder:* economic participation;* infrastructure that connects;* effective public transport;* sustainable integrated human settlements;* resilient communities;* a culture of tolerance, respect and engagement; and* effective governance institutions.However, the global and national targets we have been set for 2014, require even greater levels of galvanisation and harnessing of energies, resources and talents.This, therefore, means the immediate pursuit of five path breaking interventions, all of which are germane to any growth path, some of which needed work from a long time ago, and others which have emerged as urgent either because we face a moment of crisis or opportunity.These are the five interventions which cabinet has grappled with and which needs urgent implementation.Public TransportFirstly, addressing the crisis in Public Transport that serves as a brake on the economy, social engagement, community safety and environmental integrity.I believe that if there is only one success this PGDS achieves, it must be the turn-around of the state of public transport.Concretely, we have potentially achieved an important milestone to find additional sources of revenue to invest in transport infrastructure through the provisional approval of the proposed fuel levy for the Western Cape.The Finance and Fiscal Commission has indicated that we are on the right path in supplementing our revenue base and our feasibility research is sound.This is a major breakthrough after four years.Of course we endorse their call for deeper consultation.World Cup 2010Secondly, maximising the opportunities surrounding the 2010 World Cup in terms of growing tourism and related sectors of our regional economy, promoting healthy lifestyles choices amongst the youth and kick-starting urgently needed infrastructure investments to improve the flow of people and goods.This ambition has been given renewed impetus by the agreement we recently achieved between the Mayor and myself that the establishment of a special purpose vehicle must be expedited through provincial legislation.Furthermore, the national meeting we attended with the LOC has cemented the resolve to host the World Cup at a new Green Point Stadium.In light of these encouraging developments, I am convinced that the World Cup build-up and legacy will greatly enhance our development ambitions for the province.It is now time for all of us in the province to unite behind efforts for World Cup 2010 and ensure that we do indeed host an event that will firmly lodge the Western Cape in the world's mind as a must-see place.The Cape soccer fraternity is already enthusiastic as big crowds viewed Santos and Hanover Park recently.Even Vasco da Gama put up a spirited victorious performance against Bush Bucks over the weekend.Our Energy SupplyThirdly, the energy wake-up call we received recently in the Western Cape is a potential threat to higher rates of economic growth over the medium-term.However, higher rates of investment in energy also create an opportunity to pursue a more diversified portfolio of energy technologies which can position the Western Cape to grow the size of its environmental industries.In this regard great progress is being made through the planned investments by Eskom that have been brought forward.The latter initiative introduces the debate in this Province on the source of energy for such a base station.The transport of coal is expensive and the gas supplies are not yet reliable.The nuclear energy debate is one all of us must participate in.Skills DevelopmentFourthly, fixing the serious skills mismatch between what the regional economy needs and what comes onto the labour market from the education system has become the main disjuncture in our society and economy, fuelling inequality.This matter is beginning to receive priority attention and our Province is leading through the R70m recapitalisation of our FET Colleges underpinned by a R25m loan scheme.The establishment of focus schools responding to the variety of skills needs in the province similarly path-breaking.Only last week saw the opening of an Engineering Focus School in Mitchell's Plain, and planning for Institutes for Contemporary Music responds to the Western Cape emerging strongly as a creative centre in the country.Finally, the Western Cape's Asgisa project - The Cape Flats Renewal Programme - must come to fruition as the whole country rallies behind this extraordinary intervention to ratchet up growth through, primarily, infrastructure-driven programmes.Given that this intervention coincides spatially where the majority of poor people reside in the province, it is also appropriate that it is part of the highest priorities of the PGDS.Our draft PGDS will be unveiled next month for public engagement.It is fully compliant with the following sentiment in the PGDS Guidelines:The PGDS is the core alignment mechanism for the province and it should be seen as the coordination and implementation strategy.While driven by the province and championed by the Premier, this must be on the basis of a collaborative effort that brings all parties to the table.Given that we are advanced in our province towards a PGDS, I now want to turn to the implementation vehicles we will have to establish and overhaul to implement our development strategy for the Province.Implementation Frameworks and Institutional VehiclesThe PGDS is fundamentally about coordination, alignment and integration across provincial government departments, between spheres of government between different state bodies and between government and its social partners.Improved Cabinet SystemThis will work only with a strong policy centre at the heart of government.This requires a more focused Cabinet that can systematically drive the strategy agenda of iKapa elihlumayo as it cascades into the priorities and actions of all actors in the province.In this context we inaugurated the new, more strategically focused, Cabinet system which sees the introduction of an implementation orientated and alignment-focussed approach.A Policy Centre in GovernmentThe new Cabinet system is underpinned by a much more coherent policy centre in government.The reengineering process of my department has now brought into being a formidable policy team at the centre of government.In its establishment and operationalisation, the new policy nerve centre in my Department will work hand-in-glove with the economic and budgetary policy analysis capacity in Provincial Treasury and the team of municipal analysts in the Department of Housing and Local Government.Already, the three entities have learnt to work together and hone their skills in the development so far of the PGDS.Inter-Governmental RelationsOur Cabinet system and the policy capacity has been timed to anticipate what, over the last year, has been a veritable revolution in inter-governmental relations and planning in South Africa, consolidated by the Inter-Governmental Relations Act of 2005.On the basis of the IGR Act, the President's Coordinating Council has become the supreme forum for driving an aligned agenda of delivery across the spheres of government.The agenda of the PCC is the priorities spelled out in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework and the National Spatial Development Perspective, which are largely translated into the National Programme of Action.It is assumed that all Provinces and Municipalities must reflect the implications of the National Programme of Action in their respective development agendas (PGDS and IDPs).I am compelled by the IGR Act to use the Premier's Coordinating Forum (PCF) to ensure exactly such alignment.Thus, in the following year we will see much greater emphasis being placed on strong and meaningful inter-governmental planning and engagement in the province, based on the NSDP and the PGDS.In light of the political fragility in many municipalities in the province, I am determined to use the instruments of the IGR Act to engender calm and stability and ensure a focus on service delivery so that we can all work single-mindedly to achieve the strategic goals of the PGDS, iKapa elihlumayo.Just because we have local governments governed by coalitions, with the ongoing prospects of changes as coalitions may change, does not mean that the public should suffer through inefficiencies, poor service delivery or political brinkmanship.The PCF will drive co-ordination of the activities of government, national departments, state owned enterprises and special purpose agencies that operate in the province to engage on the unique regional dynamics of the Western Cape so that these are appropriately reflected and accommodated in national policy frameworks, programmes, projects and funding protocols, as well as monitor the cumulative impact of development in the Western Cape as we proceed with accelerated delivery.Three New Planning RegionsThe Provincial Spatial Development Framework alerted us last year to the geographical way in which our populations are moving, and in which economic opportunities are concentrating, and its impact on the natural resource base of the province.If these factors are going to be key drivers for the implementation of the PGDS, then political boundaries may not be the most useful way in which to conceive of development planning for Shared Growth.If anything, shared growth and integrated development would have a geographical logic that would cross the political boundaries of municipalities.What is emerging at this stage are three Development Planning Regions.The Premier's Coordinating Forum would soon have to discuss formalising these Regions to facilitate appropriate growth and development to coordinate better and harness expenditure and investment more intelligently.The Cape Town Functional Region, including Saldanha, Paarl, Worcester, Stellenbosch and parts of the Overberg, if we plan its future together will harness some of the most productive industrial resources of the Province and consolidate itself as our economic powerhouse.Already, 85% of general value added in the provincial economy comes from this area.The South Cape urban strip from Plettenberg Bay to Mossel Bay is showing remarkable growth potential which requires coordinated planning and appropriately targeted and sequenced investments.This today, is a bold debate we want to open up so that we can best ensure the future of all our people and the quickest way to reach our growth and development targets.Partnerships: Investment leveragingThis means that we need stronger relationships with the business community, but not only in the Province.The Western Cape is facing increasing competition from products we have traditionally exported and we are having to see off fierce challenges from countries like New Zealand (in film) and India (in business process outsourcing).However, the goodwill towards us is so great that significant global, national and domestic business leaders are keen to serve us in an advisory capacity.Such an Advisory Panel will be convened towards the end of the year as a platform from which we can improve economic performance and reach our growth targets.Partnerships: Higher Education EngagementOne of the distinct comparative advantages of the Western Cape is that we have four Universities based here, as well as the large footprint of Unisa.Yet we have been slow in harnessing this invaluable resource.We have convened all the Vice-Chancellors late last year to discuss how we can partner to each other's mutual advantage.Since then there has been a series of close interactions with the Cape Higher Education Consortium (CHEC), which represents the Universities, to work towards a Joint Programme of Action for Shared Growth in the province.This work will culminate in a Provincial Government-Higher Education Institutions Summit later this year.At the Summit we will adopt a Cooperation Agreement that will facilitate alignment between the priorities of the Universities and our Scarce Skills Strategies for the realisation of our Ikapa elihlumayo strategies.Partnerships: The Provincial Development CouncilStrategic partnerships with key investors and the universities complement the institutionalised, partnership-based, social dialogue partners in the PDC.During 2006 we will focus our engagements on the PGDS.This process will involve an extensive array of engagements with all segments of society so that we can build a vibrant democratic foundation for a consensus on, and the implementation of, our shared growth and integrated development agenda.The priorities and monitoring indicators of the PGDS will also enhance the work of the PDC because engagements will be based on budgetary priorities and departmental actions.Capacity of the State to Drive the Shared Growth Battle PlanAll our objectives, strategies and partnerships will come to naught unless we can address the capacity of the State.We have been working at this challenge in a radical and systematic fashion since the first day that I took office.I am finally in a position to report considerable progress on this front.On the 1 April 2006 the new, fully reengineered Department of the Premier came into being.Since then the new, representative and highly qualified leadership of the Department has begun their work.Over two thirds of the new SMS have post-graduate qualifications reflecting the diverse and deep skills base we sought to attract.They bring with them many years of experience in both the Public and Private sector.Their strengths span generic areas such as in personnel, finance, legal and IT management, but also the skills related to policy development, implementation and review.They will bring to government a capacity for full policy coherence and alignment through the lens of the PGDS.They will give leadership in a series of human and social capital interventions to address the skills, orientation, behavioural and management capacities of the Administration to ensure effective implementation of the Shared Growth agenda.The new SMS is also broadly representative of the provincial demographics of the labour force in the Western Cape.We have now filled 46 out of 53 posts.Of the 46, 31% is African, 45% Coloured and 24% White.Of the 46 posts we have improved the representation of women from 9% in 2004 to 33% so far.Where we need drastic action across government is in the representivity of people with disabilities.These demographic figures represent a fundamental break with the skewed and exclusionary patterns that I inherited two years ago, especially where we only had a single African person in the SMS.In the remaining appointments we will seek to improve even further on the representation of especially Coloured people and women without being overly mechanical.In ConclusionMr Speaker, the core of this third budget speech of mine as Premier revolved around the PGDS increasingly realising a Shared Prosperity for the Western Cape.That this is more possible is so only because we have done some of the hard work of deep institutional transformation in this Province.Yet, even as we speak here today, the urgency of what we must still do echoes all over this Province.The lives of many are still defined by poverty, unemployment, violence, and pathologies which emerge therefrom.There are daily battles between ordinary citizens and their instruments like the police on the one hand, and forces who believe that the conditions of poverty give them the right to conduct themselves unlawfully and illegally.I refer here to gangsters and druglords, but also refer to those who initially earned our sympathy because they do the dangerous work of protecting us for very little remuneration.But in the course of a legal strike for legitimate objectives, they have conducted themselves in a way that makes us even wonder whether they can be trusted to be the custodians of what we regard as precious in our Province.I have no doubt that, led by the police, we will continue to protect our leaders, our citizens, our commuters and our prosperity against any acts of illegality.Mr Speaker, over the past while, our vision of making this Province a Home for All has been seriously challenged.The run up to the Local Government elections have reversed some of the racial harmony and social cohesion we have sought to build.The outcomes of the elections and the existence of unstable coalitions have begun to threaten some of the hard-won stability achieved in this Province.Most significantly, we see the spectre of polarisation, exclusion and division in the Western Cape.Does this mean that the vision of a Home for All has failed and is unworkable?When Chief Albert Luthuli first verbalised this vision, it was met with three decades of absolute state brutality.Adopting the sensibility of Gramsci that hope is a long affair, we simply need to be more tenacious and work harder to realise the vision of a Home for All.The year 2006 allows us two significant opportunities to give impetus to our vision of a Home for All.Together with the rest of the country, June will see us celebrating the courage, and commemorating the sacrifices, made by the youth in 1976.The Western Cape Youth Commission together with government and youth formations are planning a month of activities that will honour the past, but will lay the foundations of unity for the future.Similarly, we will celebrate fifty years of the march by women to the Union Buildings, not simply displaying their displeasure as women with Apartheid, but forever laying down their right to be equal citizens, fully integrated into our society.In both these celebrations, the Provincial Government Departments are hard at work to deliver concretely to youth and women that which I undertook as part of our Siyabulela Campaign.I now call upon this House and the citizens and organisations of this Province to nominate those - either departed or still living - from the ranks of youth and women, who they believe are worthy of the highest honours that the Western Cape can bestow on its citizens so that we can elevate their example and hold them up as the symbols of our freedom and unity, and the architects of our Home for All.References:1.

THE WESTERN CAPEClick on each image for more detailFor more artworks by these and other South African artists, visit www.saart.co.za.The Department of Economic Development and Tourism launched the Art DÉcor Project also known as Art in Business, to give artists in the Western Cape a platform to market their products during 2005.The project is seen as an important initiative in developing the creative arts and cultural industries in a very practical way.Artists from the Western Cape had to capture "The World of Work in the Western Cape".Scenes depicting survivalist enterprises, small businesses and people working in formal organisations were submitted.The paintings had to be in acrylic or oil on hard board or canvas and had to measure 60 cm wide and 40 cm deep.Short-listed applicants underwent a screening process.The paintings had to be completed within two weeks from the date of appointment.The Department intends building a collection of paintings over a period of time.Details of the artists are made available to enable potential purchasers to contact the artists directly.Members of the group of artists exhibited at the Tourism Showcase (2005), Small Business Week (2005) and at the ArtsCape Marble Foyer, ArtsCape, Cape Town in March 2006 during the Cape Town Festival.The Department entered the works of 20 artists based in the Western Cape for POSITIVE 2006.Comments from the ArtistsVelile Soha developed an interest in art from a young age.He studied drawing, sculpturing, photography, painting, graphics and history of art.As full-time artist, Velile's works featured in several solo and group exhibitions across South Africa, Namibia, the USA and Europe.“My aim is to show outside communities how my people lives their lives,” says Velile.Robert Thembinkosi from Zwelethemba, Worcester, studied fine art during the 1980's.He has exhibited locally and internationally.Robert also writes poetry and short stories.“I paint murals, banners and signboards and teach the children in Zwelethemba (the secrets) of fine art,” says Robert.Raymond Lawrence is from Arniston.He is unmodified by formal art school and started by drawing local scenes while still at school.“I paint Kassiesbaai and other scenes exclusively from memory, rather than being at the scene,” he says.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the

Start Your Own Business Work Pack2. Support for Small Business3. Business Networking Organisations4. How to Tender for Government BusinessTHE STORY BEHIND RED DOORAround the world, small businesses are a big part of the economy.In developed countries small businesses contribute up to 60%to GDP; in South Africa, small businesses only contribute about 35% to GDP.Part of the reason for this is that compared to many similar developing countries like Brazil and India, the survival rate of small businesses in South Africa has been low.So has the level of entrepreneurship.Small business support services are badly needed; but historically, these have often been fragmented.In some areas there has been a lot of duplication of services, while in others, especially in the rural areas, there have been no support services at all.The RED Door advice centres have been established to co-ordinate support services and make sure they are easily available, when and where they are needed.The content on this page was last updated on 13 March 2009Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Publications > Guidelines, Manuals & Instructions: DRED DOOR SMALL BUSINESS ADVICE CENTRES - GUIDELINES, MANUALS & INSTRUCTIONS: DHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Publications > Strategic Plans & Business Plans: 2004RED DOOR SMALL BUSINESS ADVICE CENTRES - STRATEGIC PLANS & BUSINESS PLANS: 2004Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Services > Business & Economy > Black Economic Empowerment > Black Economic Empowerment Support ServicesHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Services > Business & Economy > Black Economic Empowerment > Application for Support from the National Empowerment Fund (NEF)Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Services > Business & Economy > Black Economic EmpowermentRED DOOR SMALL BUSINESS ADVICE CENTRES - SERVICES: BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENTThere are a variety of support services available to assist emerging enterprises. &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > RED Door Small Business Advice Centres > Services > Business & Economy > Small BusinessRED DOOR SMALL BUSINESS ADVICE CENTRES - SERVICES: SMALL BUSINESSHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > Local Economic DevelopmentLOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: OVERVIEWHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > Local Economic Development > Services > Government & Democracy > Municipal / Local Government > Local Government Development > Funding for Municipal Impact ProjectsHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic Participation > Local Economic Development > Services > Government & Democracy > Municipal / Local Government > Local Government DevelopmentLOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - SERVICES: LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENTHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Cultural Affairs & Sport > Services > Arts & Culture > Funding & Support > Support for Musicians in the Western CapeSupport for Musicians in the Western CapeWHAT'S NEW2006 ACTIVITIES* Introduction to Members of Interim Western Cape Musicians Association* Launch of WCMA Offices* WCMA Benevolent Fund LaunchThe illness of Mr Robbie Jansen, the Jazz Legend of Cape Town again raised the plight of musicians.Their concerns included:* the rights of musicians,* the establishment of a benevolent fund, and* the lack of pension and medical benefits for musicians.Participants who attended these meetings and workshops established a voluntary Interim Musicians Lobby Group.The members of this structure included Dimitri Jegels, who declined due to other commitments, Rashid Lombard (declined to attend meetings), Jai Reddy, Mohammed Fall, Joe Mthimka, Kobus Kwezi, Andre Petersen and Spencer Mbadu.At the first Western Cape Musicians Conference which was held on the 7th & 8th March 2006, at the BOE conference centre, Waterfront - an Interim Western Cape Musicians association was newly elected.The delegates who attended the conference, gave a mandate to the Interim Western Cape Musicians Association.OBJECTIVES OF THE WESTERN CAPE MUSICIANS ASSOCIATION1.

The following restrictions on the movement of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras, within or through the Worcester and Robertson districts, also remain in place:1.The movement of such animals between individual properties within the magisterial districts of Worcester and Robertson of the Western Cape Province may not take place.2.Horses from outside the surveillance zone may only move into the surveillance and free zones if they meet all the requirements specified in the protocol that has been in effect since 1997.Because the disease has become widespread in the rest of the country, few if any, horses are expected to meet these requirements at present.Their movement through the Worcester district will be on the following conditions:Movement permits must be obtained from the State Veterinarian in the area from where the animals are moving before horses are transported.The necessary notification of the movement must be done prior to departure.Vehicles transporting horses may only travel on the N1 highway through the Worcester district and may not turn off the N1 within Worcester magisterial district.The Worcester district stretches from Konstabel railway station (about halfway between Touwsrivier and Matjiesfontein) in the north up to the Rawsonville turnoff at the entrance to Du Toitskloof pass in the South.Along this route vehicles transporting horses may not stop for any protracted period of time and no horses may be up- or offloaded along this stretch of road.3.The transport of such animals along the N1 in the Worcester magisterial district may only take place during daylight between the hours of 08H00 and 17H00.4.Horseboxes or trailers must be sprayed with insecticides and insect repellents before animals are loaded for transit through the Worcester magisterial district.Owners of horses are again reminded of the measures that can be taken to prevent their animals from contracting the disease:* Vaccinate all horses according to the directions for AHS vaccine.It may be prudent to vaccinate younger foals, even if they have to be revaccinated within another few months.* Where possible horses should be stabled from late afternoon to mid-morning.* Keep horses out of low lying or marshy camps from late afternoon to mid-morning* Apply insect repellents and insecticides suitable for horses, particularly where animals cannot be stabledOn behalf of the Western Cape Department of Agriculture, I want to express appreciation for the cooperation of all parties concerned in assisting with implementing effective control measures.Alie van JaarsveldSpokespersonMinistry of Agriculture: Western CapeTel: 021 483 4930Fax: 021 483 3890Email: avjaarsv@pgwc.gov.zaHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the

8% growthThe Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town, Helen Zille, has tabled a record R17,2 billion budget to support economic growth and social development for 2006/07.The capital budget amounts to R3 bn and the operating budget totals R14,2bn.The rates and tariff increases are below the inflation rate of 5,2%.Mayor Zille declared the City's intent to work toward a sustainable growth level of around 6 to 8%.Handicap and Retirement Rebates IncreasedOne of the changes to the budget is an increased rebate for handicapped and retired persons.The rebate has been increased to accommodate people with an income up to a maximum of R3 000 per month.The rest of the social spending in the budget remained unchanged.A total of R385 million has been allocated for a range of free basic services including water, sewage and electricity.This allocation is over and above the rates exemption for some 100 000 properties in the City that are valued at less than R50 000.Rates and Tariff Increases Below Inflation RateThe City government believes it can boost its income through improved revenue collection systems.The main tariff increases are as follows:* Rates, refuse removal and sanitation will go up by 5%.* Water will increase by 7% of which 4% goes towards the new Berg River Dam project.* Electricity goes up by 4,9%Ward Allocation Increased by R100 000Every City ward will receive R100 000 more than anticipated in the draft budget.Each of the City's 105 wards will now receive R400 000 for community projects, of which R200 000 will be for capital projects and R200 000 for operational expenditure.R240 Million Infrastructure InjectionMajor additional infrastructure expenditure has been proposed in the new City Budget.An amount of R75 million has been allocated for Transport, Roads and Stormwater infrastructure, a contingency of R125 million for 2010 Soccer World Cup projects and a further R100 million for the World Cup over the coming two financial years.R40 Million for Safety And SecurityMayor Zille announced an additional capital allocation for the Metro Police and the City's Emergency Services.The Metro Police will get an extra R9,5 million to strengthen their capacity to enforce the law whilst Emergency Services is to receive an additional R6,5 million on top of the R31 million which was announced earlier this year.Eight Steps to make the Budget Work BetterMayor Zille has proposed eight steps to make the City Budget work better:* Increasing project management capacity and driving projects decisively* Initiating tender processes earlier in the financial year* Amending supply chain management policy to speed up delivery* Opening up of tender processes to public and media* Introducing a Standing Committee on Public Accounts* Taking steps to speed up the tender process* Improving performance management systems* Filling critical postsMedia enquiries:Councillor Ian NeilsonMayoral Committee Member for

World Health Day, 'Working together for health', highlights the critical role played by our health workers, and the importance of working together to achieve the best outcomes for our patients ", Minister Uys said at a gathering of health workers in George."Health workers are the heartbeat of health care in our province.They are the men and women who fulfil their duties selflessly, often under difficult circumstances", Uys said.These workers include dentists, nurses and midwives, pharmacists, home-based carers, technicians,cooks,cleaners and the whole spectrum of health workers.With reference to the shortage of health workers in the Western Cape and the tremendous pressure under which health workers have to cope, Minister Uys said his department focuses on all health care workers, the challenges they face on a day-to-day basis, and the need for management to understand, support and address their concerns.Some of the steps that are being taken include:* filling vacant positions, where possible;* training more health workers;* providing more bursaries;* expanding support structures such as home-based care;* providing scarce skills allowances and other incentives; and* creating better work environments through revitalisation and maintenance programmes."Furthermore it is important that the broader community shows more appreciation for our health workers, and does not take them for granted", Uys said."The role that our health workers play in rendering an accessible, sustainable, quality and cost-effective health service is critical for the well-being of the people of the Western Cape.A healthy province is a happy province ", he said.Health facilities across the province will celebrate World Health Day on 7 April.Open days are planned at all facilities, and communities will be invited to come and see for themselves what a day in the life of a health worker entails by taking them through the whole service spectrum, from when patients come through the security gates until the time they collect their medication and leave."With the support of our health care workers, volunteers, community workers, health forums and home-based carers, we will be able to render the quality services that are expected from us", Uys said."The Western Cape government is proud of its health care workers, and will do everything in its power to support them in rendering their crucial service.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Transport and Public Works > Corporate Affairs > Human

World Cancer Day3 February 2006The acquisition of a new R 3,2 million Oncology Afterloader, installed at the Tygerberg Hospital, is celebrated on the eve of World Cancer Day on 4 February."We continuously update and improve our cancer services because cancer patients often still have many fruitful years ahead if they receive special treatment.Our Provincial Cancer control programme is aimed at doing just that" he said.In the Western Cape, as elsewhere in South Africa, childhood cancer makes up 2% of all cancers reported.In South Africa one in four males and one in five females between 0 and 74 years is at risk of developing cancer.About 7 000 new cancer cases are expected to be reported in the Western Cape alone this year.This is up by one thousand from five years ago.Tygerberg and Groote Schuur Hospitals treat 70% of these cases..Our provincial cancer control programme is aimed at erasing the shortfall with a pronged approach which includes:1. Health promotion as a primary prevention measure2. Early detection3. Diagnosis and treatment4. Palliative care5. Hospice/step-down care centers for de-institutionalised patients6. Home based care"The provincial health department is concentrating on several remaining challenges which include poor access to treatment centers in rural areas, the development of standardized treatment protocols and staffing norms, human resource shortages and a population based cancer register" Minister Uys said.He also praised his dedicated and professional staff for the sterling job they are doing in treating our patients with expertise and compassion.The content on this page was last updated on 7 June 2006Home > Publications > Speeches > Official Unveiling of Nobel SquareOfficial Unveiling of Nobel SquareAT: V & A Waterfront16 December 2005Thank you very much, Vuyo Mbuli.I want to acknowledge Ministers Trevor Manuel and Marthinus van Schalkwyk, and thank them very much for joining us on this day; the Nobel Laureates or their representatives, Members of the Provincial Government and the Legislature, members of the Diplomatic Corps, leaders of society in South Africa, the Western Cape and Cape Town, citizens of Cape Town and South Africa, thank you very much for joining us on this day.December the 16th is Reconciliation Day.It is a day which, more than ten years ago, would have been remembered and celebrated differently.There were those who saw it as the day of the vow because of a particular episode in history.There were those who saw it as Dingani's Day because of an episode in history.There were those who saw it as the birth of Umkhonto weSizwe because of an episode in history.There were those who had other ideas about what happened on December the 16th.And it was, for the last ten years, our day in which to reconcile all the different conceptions and histories and understandings we have of what happened in South Africa; to reconcile it all and call December the 16th, the Day of Reconciliation.I think it is that, that brings us all together today, particularly in Cape Town, but all over the country.Today is the unveiling of Freedom Park for the nation.That is where the State President is.We are hoping that this Nobel Square that we are unveiling today, will be the Freedom Park of the Western Cape.We'll be able to respond to our ambitions and aspirations for reconciliation in a very special way.The Western Cape has also been asked to commence on this day, a week of reflection on particularly our slave history.And we have done so with performances at the Baxter such as Vuma, we are doing so on Sunday in Genadendal by bringing to mind fourteen outstanding figures out of that slave era - whether they were slaves or whether they were abolitionists; whether they were freed slaves or whether they were of the Xhosa communities who gave sanctuary to slaves.And so I think that this day becomes not only a day of plastering over those divisions of the past, but going into the history of the past so that we all understand who we are, look each other in the eye and be able to say: "This is who I am.I want to relate to you.I want to embrace what is common between us, and I want to appreciate what is different between us."And I think that this is what reconciliation means for us today.We are all familiar with the gold that we export, we are familiar with the fruits that we export, we are familiar with the wines that we export, and so many other things that we export.And that's a massive resource that we must have.Who will ever forget the contribution of an Archbishop Desmond Tutu who, in the 1970's and the 1980's and through to the 1990's stood out as someone who articulated the pain of our nation, whether he led the march in front, whether he presided over funerals of our youth, or whether he visited the pain of so many people who suffered under apartheid?Who will ever forget Archbishop Desmond Tutu exhorting our people, not only to struggle, but to higher levels of morality in that struggle as he sometimes stood between the instincts of our people to do horrible things to those who did horrible things to them?And he stood between them.Who will ever forget that?Who will ever forget that Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed at a very critical moment in our history our yearning to be one, our yearning to be united as a people when he said that we are the rainbow nation of God?That is what, amongst other things, made Archbishop Desmond Tutu stand out as a symbol of what we want to be as a nation.Similarly, there are moments which define FW de Klerk.The seminal moment probably is when he grabbed power from PW Botha who could not cross that Rubicon and he instead picked up the (indistinct).The moment of joy when all our hearts surged across the country when he unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, when he freed Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.And we knew at that moment that that which we had been struggling for was eminently possible, at that moment.That moment when he transcended his own history, his own party, his own people, to start a process of negotiating a better future for all our people.Those are the things, which have earned him some of the accolades that the world has been able to give.Who will be able to forget Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, his twenty-seven years in prison in the Western Cape, in Cape Town?When he could not be with us but yet was such a powerful presence amongst us.When he could not speak to us, but spoke to us in such inspirational ways that kept us believing that the future was going to be better than the present.That Nelson Mandela, who could not march with us, but led us in decisive ways that kept us going forward to this moment of victory and, this moment of peace and this moment of glory that South Africa experiences in the world.He epitomized everything that was good, that was noble and dignified, not only in our struggle but also in our people, who transformed concepts like reconciliation, forgiveness, co-existence from its original conceptions of weakness, compromise and defeat, and made them such powerful words that resonate even today across the world.That is what Nelson Mandela has been able to do to us.Chief Albert Luthuli, in his autobiography says, and I quote: "The task is not finished.South Africa is not yet a home for all her sons and daughters.Such a home we wish to ensure.From the beginning our history has been one of ascending unities, the breaking of tribal, racial and creedal barriers.The past cannot hope to have a life sustained by itself, wrenched from the whole.There remains before us the building of a new land, a home for men who are black, white, brown, from the ruins of the old narrow groups, a synthesis of the rich cultural strains which we have inherited.There remains to be achieved our integration with the rest of our continent.Somewhere ahead there beckons a civilisation, a culture, which will take its place in the parade of God's history beside other great human syntheses, Chinese, Egyptian, Jewish, European.It will not necessarily be all black; but it will be African."Those are the words of Chief Albert Luthuli.That's the inspiration that we have taken for the Western Cape.A province divided, a province not at peace with itself, a province of suspicion and fear.We've got to get out the message of Chief Luthuli that this province is not yet but can be a home for all its people.So Chief Luthuli lives with us also, in a very special way because he's the only one who has not spent an extended time to live here amongst us, whether with his will or against his will.But we thought that his vision for the Western Cape should remain a live vision that successive generations must always continue to strive towards the making of the Western Cape, a home for all.I want to end up by introducing the person who, when he was Premier, conceived of the idea of the Nobel Square.I'll be dishonest to say that it

Week is to provide pregnant women, their partners and the broader community with the knowledge of how to ensure a safe pregnancy outcome for both the mother and her baby."We focus on saving mothers and babies through early booking, early recognition of danger signs and early intervention " minister Uys said.South Africa and the Western Cape have a high infant and maternity mortality rate.Countrywide it is 12 times higher than the international Western standard.The estimated maternal mortality rate for South Africa is 175 for every 100 000 births.In the Western Cape the figure is much lower than half with 77 maternal deaths for every 100 000 births." Through awareness weeks such as these we try to lower the mortality rate " says Uys.Min Uys said women must not only adapt to a healthier lifestyle during pregnancy, but must also be more cautious then usual.He gave the following advice to pregnant women:* Visit your nearest clinic or doctor as soon as you suspect that you may be pregnant.* Book early and attend regularly for check-ups.* Nurture yourself - your nutrition is important as are exercises during pregnancy.* Substance abuse eg alcohol and smoking can harm your unborn baby.Avoid these at all costs during and after the birth of your infant.* Know you and your partner's HIV status - ask about voluntary HIV counseling and testing at your nearest clinic.* Discuss with your local clinic the need for a birth companion.* Discuss and plan feeding options with clinic staff.* Know the danger signs during pregnancy and seek help immediately at your local clinic or doctor when these signs are noted.These signs include:* bleeding from the vagina* headaches* blurred vision or seeing stars* swollen hands, feet and/or face* fits* fever* paleness and /or tiredness* difficulty in breathing* lower abdominal pains* baby not kicking well." Partners of pregnant women must also be aware of their responsibilities and not neglect their duties " Minister Uys concluded.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Community Safety > Corporate Services > Strategic ServicesSTRATEGIC SERVICES:

has Limited Effect on Export of Meat6 July 2006SOURCE: Ministry of Agriculture (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Various measures and actions have been instituted to contain the spread of Avian Influenza that has been detected north of Albertinia, between Mossel Bay and Riversdale.After further testing to determine the extent of the outbreak actions to eradicate the disease will be taken.The virus that is responsible for this outbreak has been typed as H5N2 and is not related to the virus that has caused disease in humans in Asia, Europe and North Africa.As far as is known this virus type poses no threat to humans.As part of the control measures to prevent the spread of the disease a temporary ban on all movements of ostriches and all types of domesticated poultry in the area between the N2 national road in the south and the Langeberg / Outeniqua mountain ranges in the north and the R323 between the N2 at Riversdale and the Garcia Pass and the R328 between the N2 at Hartenbos and the Robinson Pass in the west and east respectively.No movements through or originating from this area will be allowed as well as movements between properties in the area.Although the roads mentioned above forms the boundaries of the area they do not form part of it.Movement of ostriches and poultry along these roads may take place on condition that the movements do not originate or terminate in the area.It is envisaged that, with the full cooperation of all role players, the outbreak will remain confined and that the disease will be eliminated from the infected focus.It must be emphasised that this virus does not affect humans in any way and that all ostrich and poultry products commercially available are therefore safe for human consumption.Normal slaughter of ostriches from outside this area will take place.Ostriches originating from the Mossel Bay and Riversdale magisterial districts will not be slaughtered for export purposes.Email:

horses, mules, donkeys and zebras in the Worcester and Robertson magisterial districts.The purpose of this ban was to limit the spread of an outbreak of African Horse Sickness on the border between these districts.Since the last case of the disease was diagnosed four weeks ago Veterinary Services of the Western Cape Department of Agriculture is now in a position to, with effect on Friday 14 July 2006, lift the ban.It must be emphasised that all movement of horses within and into the African Horse Sickness control zones in the Western Cape must still adhere to the protocol requirements that have been in place before the ban was instituted.The details of these requirements can be obtained from the closest State Veterinarian or the State Veterinarian, Boland on telephone 021 808 5026 during office hours.The protocol aims at preventing the introduction of African Horse Sickness into the Western Cape.With the cooperation of all role players, and in particular the owners of horses, it was possible to contain the outbreak to a limited area in the Worcester and Robertson districts.The Department of Agriculture appreciates the cooperation that they received at all times during the period that the ban on the movement of animals was in place.I want to thank officials of the department for their dedication as well as horse owners for the partnerships that they've formed with us to control and curb the sickness.The content on this page was last updated on 16 July 2006Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Transport and Public

Immunisation Campaign: 8 to 14 October 20066 October 2006A free polio immunization campaign will sweep across the province from the 8th to 14th October 2006, when all children under five years of age will be immunized.Minister Uys urge parents, guardians, caregivers and the general public to take all children under five years to their nearest clinic or Community Health Centre for polio immunization, irrespective of their immunization status."Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus which affects mainly young children, but any unimmunized person can also get polio," Uys said.Minister Uys launched the Western Cape Department of Health's campaign in conjunction with the City of Cape Town today at the Tafelsig Community Centre.Approximately 150 children joined him in symbolically giving polio a "red card" to stop its spread."During the immunization campaign special efforts will be made to bring additional immunization posts to all clinics, Community Health Centres and community centres as close to communities as possible," Uys said.In addition, immunization teams comprised of health care workers will visit day care centers, crèches and pre-schools during the campaign."Polio can be prevented by routinely immunizing children against polio at birth, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks and at 18 months free at all public facilities in the province," says Dr. Ivan Toms, Executive Director of City Health.South Africa has been free of the poliovirus for over 15 years.Recently Namibia experienced an outbreak of polio earlier this year after being polio free for more than ten years.The national polio mass immunization campaign is conducted to give extra polio drops to as many children as possible.This would prevent the poliovirus from circulating among unprotected children.Children under 5 years of age are most vulnerable therefore they are targeted.Faiza SteynDirector: CommunicationTel: 021 483 3235MORE NEWSHome >

(SGBs)This publications provides parents with information on School Governing Bodies: what they are, what their function is and who participates.It also outlines parents' roles and responsibilities in the governance of the school.* What is a School Governing Body?* Who participates in the SGB?* What are the functions of the SGB?* Parental rights and responsibilitiesWHAT IS A SCHOOL GOVERNING BODY?The Schools Act says that all stakeholders in education must accept responsibility for the organisation of schools, and points out that parents and members of local communities are often in the best position to know what a school really needs and what its problems are.This is why every public school must have a governing body.Each School Governing Body (SGB) governs the management of its school.In a school that is registered as a section 21 company, the SGB is also responsible for the school's finances.WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE SGB?The SGB consists of:* the school principal* elected representatives (parents, educators, other staff members, and learners in grade 8 or above)* optional co-opted members who do not have the right to vote (for example, members of the community, or the owner of the school property).You can represent other parents on an SGB if you are nominated and voted for by the parents.The majority of voting members of the SGB must be parents.The principal will provide parents with information about SGB elections.WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SGB?The governing body must:* Decide on an admissions policy for the school.* Decide on the language policy of the school.* Decide on what religious practices will be followed at the school.* Adopt a code of conduct for learners which sets out disciplinary procedures.All these decisions and policies must be in line with national policies.The SGB must also:* Adopt a constitution setting out how the SGB will operate.* Adopt a school mission statement setting out the values and beliefs of the school.* Decide the times of the school day.* Administer the school's property, buildings and grounds.* Make recommendations regarding the appointment of educators at the school.In addition, a governing body can be given any of these functions:* maintaining and improving the school's property, buildings and grounds* deciding on the extramural curriculum and the choice of subject options according to provincial curriculum policy* buying textbooks, educational material and/or equipment for the school* paying for services to the school.The WCED supports SGBs by advising them on their responsibilities and providing training in financial management.CAN YOU HAVE A SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THE SCHOOL IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE SGB?All parents whose children are registered at school have rights and responsibilities.Even if you are not elected onto the school governing body, you still have the right to be involved in the affairs of the school by attending meetings of parents.You also have the right to be consulted by the educators or the principal about the schooling activities of your child.The principal and the educators at the school must inform you about the behaviour, attendance and learning progress of you child.Dave ShepherdTel: 021 467 2611/13Fax: 021 467 2996dshepherd@pgwc.gov.zaOr call your school-based development advisor at your

Information > I &gt HIV/Aids: Know your Rights and ResponsibilitiesHIV/Aids: Know your Rights and Responsibilities1 October 1999AUTHOR: AIDS Legal NetworkThis document contains information on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools and the rights and responsibilities of learners, educators and parents with regards to HIV/Aids.Answers are provided to some of the common questions such whether HIV positive learners can be excluded from school, whether schools can test learners for HIV and how schools can prevent the risk of HIV transmission in the school environment.Advice is also provided on drafting a school HIV/AIDS policy.Originally published in October 1999 by the AIDS Legal Network, with funding from the European Union Foundation for Human Rights.Reprinted by the WCED with kind permission.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSCan HIV positive learners be excluded from school?May learners with HIV be treated in a different way to other learners?May a school demand information about a learner's HIV status?Can schools routinely test learners for HIV?Can schools test learners for HIV without their consent?How should schools prevent the risk of HIV transmission in the school environment?What about the risk of HIV transmission through contact sport?Do learners have a right to receive education about HIV/AIDS?May condoms be issued at schools?What about educators and other staff?What should be done if there is a refusal to work, teach or study with a person with HIV?Who should be involved in developing a school policy?Further Contact DetailsTHE MANAGEMENT OF HIV/AIDS IN SCHOOLSMillions of people are infected with HIV and this number is steadily rising.As a result, increasing numbers of learners and educators infected with HIV are part of our schools.People who are infected with HIV face discrimination because of their HIV positive status.It is therefore important that all schools have an HIV/AIDS policy to ensure that:* the rights of all learners and educators are respected* learners and educators with HIV are managed appropriately* further HIV infection is prevented* a non-discriminatory and caring learning environment is created.A national policy on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools has been drafted by the Department of Education for public learning institutions.Schools and governing bodies should develop and adopt their own policies in keeping with the principles in the national policy.If a school does not have its own policy this one will automatically apply.Knowing your rights as parents, educators and learners and understanding the principles of the national policy as well as the Constitution will assist you to effectively manage HIV/AIDS effectively at your school.CAN HIV POSITIVE LEARNERS BE EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL?No. The Constitution says that everyone has a right to equality and that children have a right to a basic education.The national policy also states that no learner may be unfairly discriminated against and denied admission to a school on the basis of his or her HIV status.MAY LEARNERS WITH HIV BE TREATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO OTHER LEARNERS?Learners with HIV should not be denied the opportunity to reach their full potential.Their needs should be accommodated as far as is reasonably possible within the school environment or through home schooling if necessary.Any special measures taken must be fair, medically justifiable and taken in consultation with the learner and parent.MAY A SCHOOL DEMAND INFORMATION ABOUT A LEARNER'S HIV STATUS?No. All medical information is confidential and neither parents nor learners have a legal duty to tell the school authorities of a learner's HIV status.Should this information be voluntarily disclosed, it must remain confidential.CAN SCHOOLS ROUTINELY TEST LEARNERS FOR HIV?There is no medical or scientific justification for routinely testing learners for HIV.The testing of learners for HIV as a prerequisite for admission or continued attendance is prohibited in the National Policy.CAN SCHOOLS TEST LEARNERS FOR HIV WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT?No person may be tested without his or her consent.HOW SHOULD SCHOOLS PREVENT THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION IN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT?HIV cannot be transmitted through day-to-day social contact.Although the risk of HIV transmission in the school is insignificant, all schools should implement universal precautions to prevent the spread of all infections transmitted by blood, including HIV.These precautions include the following:* All blood and body fluids should be treated as if they are infected with HIV and handled with extreme caution.* Latex gloves should be worn by all persons attending to accidents involving blood spills.* All wounds should be cleaned with water and disinfectant immediately and covered with a waterproof dressing.* Surfaces contaminated with blood should be cleaned with a bleach solution.* All schools should have a minimum of two First Aid kits available and accessible.* Latex gloves should be available in every classroom and at every sporting event.* All learners and educators should be provided with information on how to handle blood spills.WHAT ABOUT THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION THROUGH CONTACT SPORT?The risk of HIV transmission occurring through contact sports is insignificant.However, should any bleeding occur, the injured player should be taken off the field and treated.The player may resume play once the wound has been securely covered and soiled clothes changed.Learners and coaches with HIV should receive medical counselling before participating in contact sport.DO LEARNERS HAVE A RIGHT TO RECEIVE EDUCATION ABOUT HIV/AIDS?The National Policy states that a continuing HIV/ AIDS education programme should be implemented in all schools.This should be integrated into a Life-Skills programme and should be age appropriate and accurate.Parents should be informed of this programme.MAY CONDOMS BE ISSUED AT SCHOOLS?The National Policy acknowledges that this is a complex issue and suggests that issues such as this are resolved taking into account the needs and values of the specific school community.WHAT ABOUT EDUCATORS AND OTHER STAFF?The National Policy on HIV/AIDS applies to both learners and educators.This means that staff in an educational setting may not be:* tested for HIV without their consent.* tested for HIV as a prerequisite for appointment or continued service.* forced to disclose their HIV status.* dismissed or demoted because of their HIV status.* discriminated in any way because of their HIV status.This is in keeping with the fair labour practices as set out in the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Equity Act.WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IF SOMEONE REFUSES TO WORK, TEACH OR STUDY WITH A PERSON WITH HIV?Accurate information must be provided to learners, educators and parents.This should be followed up with counselling, if necessary.The situation should be resolved by the principal with the help of the governing body if necessary.Your school HIV/AIDS policy should include guidelines on the following:* Non-discrimination* Admission Policy* HIV testing* Prevention of HIV transmission* Management of HIV/AIDS* HIV/AIDS education programmes* Refusal to study, teach or work with a person with HIVWHO SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A SCHOOL POLICY?The governing body of the school should develop and adopt its own policy in consultation with the wider school community.This could be done through the establishment of a Health Advisory Committee for the school.The policy may not deviate from the basic principles in the National Policy and should seek to create an environment in which people with HIV will be treated in a just, humane and life-affirming way.FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT:The Western Cape Education Department HIV/AIDS Life-Skills ProgrammeProgramme

Centres (EMDCs) manage the assessment process.For more information, contact your nearest EMDC.* Education Management and Development CentresThe content on this page was last updated on 16 February

Directories > Services > Educational > Social Issues Affecting Schools > Preventing Discrimination against HIV-positive Learners and EducatorsAll learners and educators should respect the rights of other learners and educators.Schools should create an environment which prevents discrimination against HIV-positive learners and staff-members by:* providing accurate and understandable information on HIV/AIDS to all members of staff, learners and parents.* implementing an HIV/Aids Policy.The national Department of Education (DoE) has drafted a national policy on the management of HIV/AIDS in schools.The national policy applies to both learners and teachers.School governing bodies should develop and adopt their own policies, which must be in line with the national policy.They should do this in consultation with the wider school community.The document Know Your Rights And Responsibilities gives information on the key points of the national policy and how to create a School HIV/Aids policy.For more information, contact the WCED HIV/Aids Life-Skills Programme:Peter FentonTel: 021 467 2125 / 6 / 7* HIV/Aids: Know your Rights and Responsibilities (Public Information)Home >

Schools > Interventions for Youth at RiskInterventions for Youth at RiskYouths at risk are learners who have problems such as drug and/or alcohol abuse or are in trouble with the law.Their emotional and/or behavioural problems are barriers to their learning and development.In the Western Cape there are five levels of support to prevent or resolve such problems.The type of support and the restrictions that may be placed on the learner depend on the nature of the problem.Interventions include educational, therapeutic and/or residential support services.The five levels of support are:* Prevention in all schools* Early intervention in all schools* School-based support programmes* Youth care and education centres* Special youth care and education centresLEVEL 1: PREVENTION IN ALL SCHOOLSAn early-warning system, aimed at identifying children and families who may be particularly vulnerable, is implemented in all schools.Every effort is made in the classroom to prevent emotional and/or behavioural difficulties from occurring or worsening.LEVEL 2: EARLY INTERVENTION IN ALL SCHOOLSEmotional support and guidance are provided for learners who are struggling with emotional and/or behavioural barriers to learning in the classroom.LEVEL 3: SCHOOL-BASED SUPPORT PROGRAMMESSchool-based support programmes, youth development programmes and deliberate intervention are provided for learners who are identified as being at risk of being expelled from school, being placed away from home, or entering the criminal justice system, and for whom temporary withdrawal from the classroom is necessary.LEVEL 4: YOUTH CARE AND EDUCATION CENTRESWhere the learner does not benefit adequately from the support programme, referral to a residential or developmental programme at a youth care and education centre may be considered.The principle of using the least restrictive and most empowering (normative) environment applies throughout the system.Young people are referred to these centres in accordance with the relevant legislation.The centres provide accommodation and a structured programme.The framework for good practice in these institutions is based on the standards laid down by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.These standards aim to:* Build the capacity of educators and principals to meet the challenges of dealing with learners experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, emotional and/or behavioural barriers to their development.* Improve services to learners at risk.* Ensure the safety, education and development of these learners.There are four Youth Care and Education Centres in the Western Cape:* Faure Youth Care Centre* Die Bult Youth Care Centre* Ottery Youth Care Centre* Wellington Youth Care Centre.LEVEL 5: SPECIAL YOUTH CARE AND EDUCATION CENTRESSpecial care is provided to young people who are in conflict with the law or in severe emotional turmoil and who may need to be physically, emotionally and/or behaviourally contained.Young people are referred to these centres by the courts under the relevant legislation for compulsory residence.Each young person is provided with an individual development plan to help him or her to be rehabilitated.A psychologist, occupational therapist, professional nurse and social worker are available at the centre for consultation.The educators are specially trained in child-care theory and practice.There are two such youth centres in the Western Cape:* De Novo Special Youth Care Centre* Eureka Special Youth Care Centre.For

provided at home will meet the minimum requirements of the curriculum at public schools.* The home education will be of a standard not inferior to the standard of education provided at public school.* The parents will comply with any other reasonable conditions set by the Head of Education.Registration can be withdrawn.Before this can happen, the Head of Education must:* Inform the parent and give reasons for the withdrawal.* Give the parent an opportunity to make representations.A parent can appeal to the provincial Minister of Education against a refusal to register a learner or the withdrawal of a registration.ENDING HOME EDUCATION REGISTRATIONIf a learner who has been registered for home education is later admitted to a public or independent school, the parent must request the Head of Education in writing to end the learner's registration for home education.Applications are made on the required form which can be obtained from the WCED.The parent must submit the completed form with a copy of the learner's birth certificate.* Policy for the Registration of Learners for Home Education (Policy)* Guidelines for Home Education (Service)Home >

work that is consistent with the curriculum and that they are being assessed and are achieving the outcomes required of the particular grade.To ensure that learners are achieving the required results, the parent needs to:* Keep certain records* Appoint an independent assessorKEEPING RECORDSAfter the learner has been registered for home education, the parent must:* Keep a record of attendance.* Keep a portfolio of the learner's work.* Maintain up-to-date records of the learner's progress.* Keep a portfolio of the educational support given to the learner.* Keep evidence of the continuous assessment of the learner's work.* Keep evidence of the assessment and/or examinations at the end of each year.* Keep evidence at the end of Grades 3, 6 and 9 showing whether or not the outcomes for these grades have been achieved.These records must be made available for inspection by the WCED.All relevant assessment results must be kept for three years.INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTAt the end of every phase, the parents must appoint, at their own expense, an independent, suitably qualified person, who is approved by the Head of Education, to assess the learner's progress at the end of that phase.A parent can approach a public school or a registered independent school for help in finding an appropriate person.The assessor must submit a statement to the Head of Education confirming that the learner has reached the required level.For more information, contact:Dave Shepherd* Registration for Home Education (Service)Home > Directories > Projects >

Admissions to SchoolsChildren may enter Grade 1 a year earlier if the WCED's assessment shows them to be ready for school.Some schools offer Grade R/0 to help children prepare for Grade 1.Children are usually allowed to start Grade R in the year they turn six.When you apply at a school to have your child enrolled, you need to have:* your child's official birth certificate* proof that your child has been immunised.Non-South African citizens also need to have:* a study permit* a temporary or permanent residence permit or proof that you have applied for permission to stay in South Africa.No school may unfairly discriminate against a child.Thus no public school may require children to write an admissions test, or prevent a child from coming to the school because the parents have not paid or cannot pay the school fees.Submit your application as early as possible the year before your child will be starting at his or her new school.Submit your application not only to the school of your choice but also to several "second-choice" schools.You can search for schools in your area using the "Find-a-School" Search Facility.Home > Directories > Services > Educational >

Holland to Helderberg21 August 2007Media Statement by Western Cape Minister of Health, Pierre UysThe names of two hospitals in the Western Cape will change.The current Hottentots Hospital in the Helderberg region will become the Helderberg Hospital, while Eben Donges Hospital in Worcester will be renamed the Worcester Hospital.The process to change the names was initiated after a round of community Imbizo's last year during which a number of objections about the names of these hospitals were raised by local communities.Following the Imbizo's, Uys invited comment on the current names from interested parties through newspaper advertisements.A number of suggestions were received and after further consultation the Minister decided to rename the hospitals to the region/town in which they functioned."I believe the majority of the people in the Western Cape would support the name changes as it allows people to take pride in their local hospital " says Uys.Communications for the

goal of Khanya is to promote learning and to maximise educator capacity by integrating the use of appropriate, available and affordable technology into the curriculum delivery process."By the start of the 2012 academic year, every educator in every school of the Western Cape will be empowered to use appropriate and available technology to deliver curriculum to each and every learner in the province."Starting with the most disadvantaged schools, Khanya works towards eradicating the digital divide and achieving racial and gender equity.Some of the specific objectives of the project include:* using technology to help educators* providing an opportunity for learners to benefit from a variety of learning styles, using technology* using technology to help disabled learners* increasing the number of learners taking Mathematics and Science on the higher grade and coping successfully* preparing all learners for the Information Age* narrowing the digital divide* providing all educators and learners in the province with an email address.1 April 200131 March 2012* What is the Khanya Project?* Achievements* For More InformationWHAT IS THE KHANYA PROJECT?The Khanya Project is an initiative of the Western Cape Education Department, which started in April 2001.The project looks at ways to use information, communication and audiovisual technology to improve teaching and learning, or curriculum delivery in schools.The aim is that every teacher in the Western Cape will eventually use technology, such as computers or televisions, to teach.This can help alleviate the shortage of qualified teaching staff at many schools.The project also expects that learners will be able to use computers to learn.Hardware in the form of computers and software such as computer programmes are supplied to schools.The implementation depends on the specific needs of the school.Although all schools will eventually be targeted, the project has initially been implemented where the need is greatest and where results are most likely to be achieved.The project is therefore focusing on well-managed schools in poor areas with sound academic results, where new technology will make the most difference to the lives of teachers and learners.The schools are invited to join the project when their staff is ready to adopt the technologies and integrate them into their teaching practices.The project has done a survey to find out what the technology needs of each school are.Computer networks are established with Internet connectivity and audiovisual facilities in individual schools answering to their specific educational needs.KHANYA PARTNERSKhanya's immense success is due in part to the amazing partnerships between the project, private businesses, non-profit organisations and other government departments and projects.If you would like to find out how you can support the project, contact Ingrid Graham at 021 467 2228, fax her at 021 425 7458 or email her at ingridg@xsinet.co.za.The Computer Society of South Africa is assisting Khanya through facilitating learnships into the Khanya Learnership Kickstart Programme.If you are interested in participating in this programme complete the expression of interest form.ACHIEVEMENTSThe Khanya Project has been highly acclaimed locally and internationally.Its latest accolade came in September 2004, when it won the Standard Bank Centre for Public Sector Innovation Award in the category Innovative Service Delivery Institutions.Khanya Achievements as at March 2006:* 490 schools have been helped to use technology effectively.* Another 134 schools are in various stages of preparation for the next wave of implementation.* A total of 18,306 computers are used in Khanya schools (of these 10,561 have been funded by Khanya or its donor partners, and the balance of 7,745 have been procured by the schools themselves).* 13,034 Educators are being empowered to use technology optimally for curriculum delivery .* 432,460 learners are already reaping the benefits of the project.FOR MORE INFORMATIONKhanya has a comprehensive website that contains details of their activities in particular schools and regions, as well as answers to frequently asked questions about the project.Or you can contact:Aletta CroftonKhanya Office Manager18th floor, Sanlam Golden

Transport from 25 May to 20 June 2003.The survey provided an accurate analysis of the population's transport habits broken down by gender, modes of transport, rural and urban areas, and local authority planning zones (e.g. townships and suburbs within Johannesburg).The Survey interviewed around 50 000 households nationwide to determine their travel patterns and which modes of transport

SystemApartheid urban design ensured that Cape Town's poor and working class live furthest from their places of work.Many people thus rely on public transport.The Provincial Government has developed a mobility strategy to revitalise the public transport system and address some of the problems created by the existing infrastructure.The first phase of this extensive project will be the introduction of a rapid bus transit (RBT) system along the Klipfontein corridor.This will entail a dedicated bus route from Khayalitsha to Mowbray, along with improved cycling and pedestrian paths.It is expected that the development of Klipfontein Road into a transport corridor will result in many advantages for businesses, communities and public transport operators.The project is a joint initiative between the Department of Transport and Public Works and the City of Cape Town.Read more about the rapid bus transit system:Cape Town studies rapid bus

SceneWhat to Do at an Accident SceneThis document contains step-by-step information on what to do if you are in a vehicle accident.WHAT TO DO AT AN ACCIDENT SCENEIf you are involved in an accident, you need to:* Stop.* Help anyone who is hurt.* Find out what the extent of the damage is.* Get all relevant information.* Report the accident to the police.* Do not interfere with the evidence.* Be aware of the legal consequences.The police will complete an accident report, which is filed either with the SAPS, the local municipality or the provincial Department of Transport and Public Works, depending on whether a criminal case has been opened and whether the accident occurred inside the area of the local authority.All accident reports for accidents outside municipal areas, where there is no criminal case being investigated, are kept with the Department.STOP!If you are involved in an accident that causes injury to or the death of anyone, or which causes damage to property or any animal, you are required by law to stop your vehicle.It is a crime not to stop after an accident, and you could be fined up to R36,000, or sent to prison for up to nine years, or both.You don't have to stop or report an accident if you crash into a tree and only damage your own car and you yourself are the only one that gets hurt.But, if you damage someone else's property you must stop and then report the incident at the nearest police station.When you stop, you should switch on your hazard lights to warn other traffic of the accident.HELP ANYONE WHO IS HURTThe national 24-hour emergency number is 084124 or you can phone the SAPS on 10111.If you don't know anything about first aid, be careful not to do anything that might make the injury worse.Unless you yourself need to go for help, you must stay at the scene until a police officer says you can leave.You can be criminally charged for failing to help anyone who is hurt in the accident.FIND OUT WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE ISYou will need to find out how much damage has been caused to property.You need to give your name and address and vehicle registration number to anyone who might need them.GET ALL RELEVANT INFORMATIONIf you are involved in the accident, you should try to get the following information from all parties involved and witnesses:* full names* ID numbers* addresses* telephone details* vehicle registration numbers.You should also get:* descriptions of the vehicles* details of police and traffic officers and ambulance personnel* details of tow truck personnel.This information will help you if you want to make a claim against your insurance or against the Road Accident Fund, or if you want to claim the costs of repairs from the other party.At a later stage, you or your lawyers may need a copy of the accident report that is filled out by the police.REPORT THE ACCIDENT TO THE POLICEThe police don't have to be called to the scene if no one has been hurt, but the accident must be reported - by both drivers - at a police station or traffic office within 24 hours.You must also show your driver's licence.If you are hurt and can't report the accident immediately, you must do it as soon as possible and explain why there has been a delay in reporting the accident.It is an offence not to report an accident in which another person's property has been damaged, or in which another person is injured, even if neither of the drivers intends taking legal action.DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE EVIDENCEYou must NOT drink any alcohol or take any drugs that have a narcotic effect unless it is on doctor's orders.If the police ask you to go for a medication examination, you must not drink any alcohol or take any drugs that have a narcotic effect before the examination and before you have reported the accident.If anyone is injured in the accident, the vehicles may not be moved before the police or traffic officer have arrived and said that the vehicles can be moved.If the accident totally block the passage of other vehicles, the vehicle may be moved sufficiently to allow vehicles to pass, but only after you have clearly marked the vehicle positions (for example with chalk or spray paint).BE AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE LEGAL CONSEQUENCESSome of the possible legal consequences following an accident are:* a criminal charge of driving without a license* a criminal charge of drunken driving* a criminal charge of culpable homicide* a civil claim for damage to property* a civil claim for personal injury.The content on this page

Registration after 30 days, but before one year* Registration after one year, but before 15 years* Registration after 15 years* Children born outside South Africa* Contact detailsNote: You do not need to register a birth, if the child is not born alive.REGISTRATION WITHIN 30 DAYSTo register your child, you need to fill out form BI-24 and submit it at the nearest Home Affairs office.This form contains a description of the child (gender etc) as well as the child's name and surname.The parents should bring along their ID books and the child's hospital certificate or clinic card.REGISTRATION AFTER 30 DAYS, BUT BEFORE ONE YEARIf you have not registered your child in the first 30 days, but your child is still younger than one year, you need to complete form BI-24, and explain why the child's birth was not registered within the 30 days period.REGISTRATION AFTER ONE YEAR, BUT BEFORE 15 YEARSIf the child is more than a year old but is still younger than 15, you need to complete form BI-24/1 and submit it along with written reasons why the birth was not notified in the 30 day period.You will need:* Affidavits by the parents or, where the parents are deceased, by a close relative at least 10 years older than the child, confirming the child's identity and status.and* Documentation proving the identity and status of the child, for example:* A certificate from the hospital or maternity home where the child was born, signed by the person in charge and containing the institution's official stamp.* Confirmation of the child's personal details as extracted from the school register of the first school attended by the child.The confirmation must be on the school's official letterhead, must be signed by the principal and must contain the school's official stamp.* The child's baptismal certificate.* In the case of abandoned children, a social worker report.* The child's clinic card.* The child's school reports.REGISTRATION AFTER 15 YEARSIf you are older than 15 and have not been registered, your birth registration application must accompany your application for an Identity Document.You must submit form BI-24/15 as well as form BI-9 (which is the application for an identity document).* Documentation proving your identity and status, for example:* A certificate from the hospital or maternity home where you were born, signed by the person in charge and containing the institution's official stamp.* Confirmation your personal details as extracted from the school register of your first school.* Your baptismal certificate.* Your clinic card.* Your school reports.CHILDREN BORN OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICAYou will have to complete the registration form (BI-24, BI-24/1 or BI-24/15) and submit it along with:* a BI-529 Citizenship Questionnaire* a certified copy of the child's foreign birth certificate containing full particulars of the child's parents* in the case of children 15 years and older, a BI-9 application for an identity document.For more information, visit the Department of Home Affairs website or contact your nearest home affairs office.* Home Affairs OfficesDepartment of Home Affairs (The Government of

Death CertificateObtaining a Death Certificate* Registering a Death (Service)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Life & Family > Death > Making a WillWhen you die, your estate is divided out between your family or the people that you want to have inherit from you.The estate consists of your personal property and possessions, as well as any money or other assets owed by you.Who your property is passed on to depends on whether you have a valid will or not.If you have a valid will then the property is divided according to your wishes.If you die without a will (called intestate) then your property will be divided up amongst your immediate family according to the laws of intestate succession.CREATING A VALID WILLIf you are older than 16, you can make a will stating who you want your property to go to when you die.For your will to be valid it needs to be made in the proper way and you need to be mentally competent when you create the will.This means that you must be able to understand the consequences of creating a will, must be in a reasonable state of mind and remember what you own.For a will to be valid you must make sure that:* The will is in writing.* Two people older than 14 witness the making of the will (these witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will).* You have initialled every page of the will and signed the last page, in the presence of the witnesses.* The witnesses have initialled and signed the will.In your will you can:* appoint an executor* divide up your property.An executor is the person that will make sure that your property is divided up according to your wishes, as set out in your will.The executor also settles your outstanding debts.If you don't choose an executor, the court will appoint someone, usually a family member to be your executor.You can get a lawyer to help you to draw up a will or you can get an easy-to-complete will form from a stationary shop.DYING WITHOUT A WILLIf you don't have a valid will when you die, your property is divided up according to the rules set out in the law.These rules state that:* A married person's property is shared equally by their spouse and their children.* The property is divided between other family members if there is no spouse or children* If there are no blood relatives then the property is given to the government.Different rules apply under customary law but this results in a situation that is totally unfair to the wife.For more information on wills and deceased estates, visit the Department of Justice website.Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (The Government of South Africa)* Deceased Estates: Wills (Public Information)Home > Publications > Public Information > I &gt Deceased Estates: WillsDeceased Estates: WillsPlease note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive guide on wills.A will is a specialized document, which should preferably be drawn up by an expert like an attorney or trust company.The information merely aims to inform people about some basic aspects of wills.* Who is competent to make a will?* Who is competent to act as a witness to a will?* What are the requirements for a valid will?* What are the requirements for a valid will if I cannot sign my name?* What is a codicil?* What if I want to amend my will?* Must I amend my will after divorce?* What will happen if I do not leave a will?WHO IS COMPETENT TO MAKE A WILL?Everyone 16 years old and over, unless at the time of making the will they are mentally incapable of appreciating the consequence of their actions.WHO IS COMPETENT TO ACT AS A WITNESS TO A WILL?Anyone who is 14 years old and over and who at the time that they witness the will is competent to give evidence in court.A beneficiary to a will should not sign as a witness, because they will then be disqualified from receiving any benefit from that will.There are some exceptions to this rule.Consult your legal representative for more information in this regard.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID WILL?* Since 1 January 1954 all wills must be in writing.They can be written by hand, typed or printed.* The testator (person making the will) must sign at the end of the last page of the will.* The testator must sign all other pages of the will anywhere on the page.* The testator must sign the will in the presence of two or more competent witnesses.* The witnesses must attest and sign the will in the presence of the testator and of each other.WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID WILL IF I CANNOT SIGN MY NAME?You may ask someone to sign the will on your behalf or you can sign the will by the making of a mark (for example a thumbprint or a cross).If you make a mark, or get someone to sign on your behalf, you must follow these requirements:* If it was made after 1 January 1954, the will must be in writing.It can be written by hand, typed or printed.* The testator must sign the will at the end of the last page by making a mark, or if someone signs on their behalf, this other person must sign at the end of the last page in the presence and by the direction of the testator.* The mark or the signature of the other person signing on behalf of the testator must be made in the presence of two or more competent witnesses and a commissioner of oaths.* If the will consists of more than one page, every page except the last one must be signed by the testator or by the person signing on their behalf anywhere on the page.* A commissioner of oaths must certify that they are satisfied as to the identity of the testator and that the will is the will of the testator.* The commissioner of oaths must sign a certificate and each page of the will, anywhere on the page.WHAT IS A CODICIL?A codicil is a schedule or annexure to an existing will, which is made to add to or to change an existing will.A codicil must comply with the same requirements as a valid will (listed above).A codicil does not need to be signed by the same witnesses who signed the original will.WHAT IF I WANT TO AMEND MY WILL?Amendments to a will can only be made while executing a will or after the date of execution of the will.Amendments to a will must comply with the same requirements for a valid will (listed above).When amending a will, it is not necessary for the same witnesses who signed the original to sign the updated will.MUST I AMEND MY WILL AFTER DIVORCE?A bequest to your ex in your will, which was made before your divorce, will not necessarily fall away after the divorce.The Wills Act says that, unless you specifically provide otherwise, a bequest to your divorced spouse will be cancelled if you die within three months of the divorce.This gives a divorced person three months after the divorce in which to amend their will.Should you not change your will within three months after your divorce, your divorced spouse will benefit as indicated in the will.WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DO NOT LEAVE A WILL?If you die without leaving a will or a valid will, your estate will be split up according to the Intestate Succession Act, no. 81 of 1987.The estates of people who die intestate and whose estates are governed by the principles of customary law, must be reported to the Magistrate for the area in which the person was resident at the time of their death.The local magistrate should be consulted on how an estate that is subject to customary law will be dealt with.* Making a Will (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Social Services > Children & Families > Giving up a Child for AdoptionGiving up a Child for AdoptionBoth the mother and the father must sign the consent form to allow the adoption by a specific person or couple.If the biological parents are not married, the mother must first get the consent of the biological father.However she only needs to do this if the pregnancy was not the result of violence, and if the father acknowledges in writing that he is the father and has made his identity and address available.Putting a child up for adoption is a difficult thing to do and adoption agencies will provide support services to assist you.These can include counselling and even accommodation.For more information contact your District Office of the Department of Social Development or an adoption agency in your area.* Cape Town Child Welfare Society Website (Link)* Adoption Matters Act, 56 of 1998 (Act) (File type: pdf)* Adopting a Child (Service)* Finding

about Biological ParentsFinding Information about Biological ParentsAs an adopted child, you can start a search for your biological parents if you are over 18 years old.If you are between 18 and 21, you will need to have your adoptive parents' written permission.If you are over 21 you can search without your adoptive parents' permission.Before you can start the search, you will receive counselling by a social worker.Adoption records are kept for 70 years and are the initial source of information.The records are kept with the Registrar of Adoptions in Pretoria.The following records are kept:* The consent form* The adoptive parents' applicationThe* social worker's report on the adoptive parents* The social worker's report on the birth parents (if it exists).Specific information regarding an adoption may be given to any person at the discretion of the Registrar.But the identity of the parties cannot be made known.For example, medical information can be made available to a doctor.Biological parents can only have access to the adoption records if the adoptive parents and the child give their written consent.If they refuse, the biological parents can leave their details in the file so that they can be contacted if the adoptive parents or child change their minds.For more information contact the Registrar of Adoptions at the National Department of Social Development in Pretoria.Ms.Department of Social Development (The Government of South Africa)* Giving up a Child for Adoption (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Social Services > Children & Families > Getting a Maintenance OrderGetting a Maintenance OrderBoth parents have a legal duty to support their children.One parent can apply to the Maintenance Court for the other parent to pay support for their children.Usually a mother will apply for an order against a father.If the children are not living with the mother or the father, the person who is looking after them can apply for maintenance from the parents.For example, if a child is living with the grandparents, the grandparents can apply to get maintenance from the father and the mother of the child.Once there is a court order instructing a parent to pay child support, it is a criminal offence not to pay.They also deal with applications to get more or to pay less maintenance.This is a long and complicated process and may take some time.To apply for a maintenance order against the parent of your child, you need to:1. Go to the Maintenance Office at the Maintenance Court in your area to apply for the court order.* The name and address of the person against whom the order is being made, and the details of where they work* A photograph of the other person (if available)* Your identity document* The children's birth certificates* A letter of attendance from the school principal for any school-going child* A copy of the divorce order (if applicable)* Proof of your income (like a salary or slip)* Your papers, receipts and accounts, showing all the things you must pay every month2. The maintenance officer will send a summons to the person against whom the order is being made asking them to come to the maintenance office on a certain date.3. On the date, you and the other party must go to the office to determine how much that person must pay for the children.4. The maintenance officer will help you work out all the things you must pay for every month, how much money you earn and how much money the other parent earns.5. If the person against whom the order is being made says that they are not the parent of the child, you need to ask the court to order a paternity test.6. If you agree how much the person must pay for the children, the maintenance officer will get both of you to sign a paper called an order of court.This says that the other party must pay the agreed amount of money every week or every month.7. If you do not agree, or if the other person does not come to the office on that date, then the officer will say your case must go to the Maintenance Court.The court sends notices to both parties telling you both to come to the Maintenance Court on a certain date.8. The magistrate will listen to both the parents' stories.They will ask both parties to show how much they earn and how much they pay every month for things like rent, electricity and food.9. The magistrate then decides how much the other person must pay for the children.The magistrate will make this amount an order of court, in writing.10. The person against whom the order is being made must pay the maintenance amount every week or month to the maintenance office.You must then collect the money from the maintenance office.For more information contact the maintenance officer at your local Magistrates' Court.* Magistrates' Courts* Enforcing a Maintenance Order (Service)* Maintenance Act, 99 of 1998 (Act)Enforcing a Maintenance OrderIf the court has ordered that a parent must pay child support, it is a criminal offence not to pay.If the person who has been ordered to pay maintenance does not pay, even though the court has ordered them to do so, you need to:1. Go to the maintenance office and complain.It is important to make a formal complaint every time when the other parent doesn't pay.2. The maintenance office records each time the other parent pays.This record will show when they do not pay and how much they owe.3. If the other parent is employed and failed to pay maintenance, you must ask the court to make an order to get the maintenance directly from their employer.4. If the other party does not pay, they are not obeying the order of court.This is a crime.The court will send them a notice telling them to come to court on a certain date.They must then explain why they did not pay the money.5. For more information contact the maintenance officer at your local Magistrates' Court.* Getting a Maintenance Order (Service)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Department of

Commissioner, who hears each side of the story and asks questions.The Small Claims Court does not hear divorce cases.To institute a claim in the Small Claims Court, you need to:* Give the other person a written demand giving them 14 days to comply.* After 14 days, institute a claim with the clerk of the Court.* Serve a summons on the other person.* Go to court on the set date with all

PermitsYou need to apply for specific permits before you come to the country.There are various types of permits, depending on why you want to come to the country:* visitors permit - for people visiting South Africa* diplomatic permit - for diplomats* study permit - for people wanting to study in South Africa* treaty permit - temporary residence permits for people who need to be in South Africa in terms of an international treaty* business permit - for people who want to invest or buy into a business into South Africa* crew permit - for ship's crews* medical treatment permit - a three-month permit for people seeking medical treatment in South Africa* relatives permit - for people with South African relatives* retired person permit - for people who have a fixed retirement

versa.You cannot enter the country until you have the valid permit attached to your passport, unless you already have a permit and you want to change it to another one.Permit applications are governed by the Immigration Act, 2002.WORK PERMITSThere are different types of work permits:* quota work permit* general work permit* exceptional skills work permit* intra-company transfer work permit* corporate work permitThe Department approves applications for work permits based on whether or not a South African is available to fill the position applied for.If there is, it's unlikely that the work permit application will be successful.The Department readily approves work permit applications for key personnel (for e.g. a CEO) of foreign companies investing in South Africa.The Immigration Act introduced a quota system for work permits.HOW TO APPLY FOR A WORK PERMITYou need to submit an application on form BI-159 via the South African diplomatic representative in the country where you normally live or the country of which you have a passport.You can also apply through a South African attorney or agent who has power of attorney for you.Your application needs to be accompanied by:* a firm offer of employment* a letter from the prospective employer stating the date that the position became available, how it was advertised and why it's necessary to employ a non-South African.The fee for each work permit application is about US$186 and generally takes eight to twelve weeks.Applications for key personnel however generally take about two weeks.Once your application has been processed, the outcome is faxed to the SA representatives at the country where you applied.HOW TO APPLY FOR A STUDY PERMITYou first need to apply for admission to the higher education institution you want to attend.When you receive a letter of provisional acceptance you can apply for a study permit.You need to go to the SA Mission to apply for the permit.You will need to complete the application form, B1-159.This needs to be accompanied by:* The prescribed fee.* A provisional letter of acceptance from the higher education institution.* Details of your accommodation arrangements.* Proof that you can pay your tuition and accommodation fees and support yourself.* A cash deposit or bank guaranteed cheque equivalent to the cost of a return air ticket.* A written undertaking that you will return to your country of residence or origin when you have completed your studies.* A doctor's report or letter from your doctor saying that you are in general good health.If your application is successful, you will be given a multiple re-entry visa.It can take up to eight weeks for an application to be processed.You cannot enter South Africa until this permit is finalised.* Applying for a Visa to Visit South Africa (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Arts & Culture > Permits > Registration of Private Collections of Fossils, Archaeological Artefacts and MeteoritesRegistration of Private Collections of Fossils, Archaeological Artefacts and MeteoritesLegally, owners of privately held collections of fossils, artefacts and meteorites that were collected under previous legislation had until 1 April 2002 to register their collections with the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA).There are a number of advantages to creating a register of these items:* Each collection has a catalogue, ensuring that the information is not lost.* Provision is made for bequeathing the collection to family, friends or to an institution.* Professionals who ratify these collections can advise and aid the owner.* The collections become legal.* Important information held in these collections becomes part of the shared national estate.The registration process does not affect the ownership of the registered collections, which remain the property of the owner.* all collections of archaeological artefacts, including artefacts older than 100 years, rock paintings or rock engravings, artefacts that have been excavated or collected from sites associated military history older than 75 years, and artefacts associated with ships and other wrecks older than 60 years.* all collections of fossils and other palaeontological material (including trace fossils such as ancient footprints).* all collections of

get married without special permission and anyone under the age of 21 has to get their parents' permission before they can get married.A marriage contracted without the required consent is voidable.This means that it can be declared null and void by the High Court.The parents or guardian can apply to the High Court for a declaration voiding the marriage.This application needs to be made:* before the minor turns 21* within six weeks of finding out about the marriage.The minor may apply to the court to void the marriage at any time before they turn 21, or within three months after turning 21.PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR MINORS (ANYONE UNDER 21)Where both parents are alive and neither of the parents has sole guardianship of the minor, both parents must consent to the marriage, in writing, on form BI-32.If the minor is a child born out of wedlock, only the mother's written consent on form BI-32 is required.If one parent has been granted sole guardianship of the minor, only that parent's written consent is required on form BI-32.If the minor is in the care of a legal guardian, only the guardian's written consent (BI-32) is necessary.If a parent whose consent is legally required cannot be found to grant consent, or is legally incompetent to do so, you can apply to a commissioner of child welfare for consent to the marriage.Should the minor's parents, and/or a commissioner of child welfare refuse to grant consent, the minor may apply to a Judge of the High Court for consent.The Judge will not grant consent unless there is sufficient evidence that the marriage is in the interest of the child and that consent has been unreasonably refused.SPECIAL PERMISSION FOR BOYS UNDER 18 AND GIRLS UNDER 15Boys under 18 and girls under 15 must get the written consent of their parents to marry, in the same way as other minors.They also have to get the consent of the Minister of Home Affairs.You can also apply to the Minister to condone a marriage that has already taken place without the required consent.* Applying for a Marriage Certificate (Service)The content on this page was last updated on 14 January 2004Home > Directories >

weeks to process.* Getting Permission to Marry if you are Underage (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Life & Family > Marriage/Divorce > Getting DivorcedThis ends the marriage and the divorced parties can legally marry again.The divorce process will depend on whether the marriage is a civil marriage or a customary marriage.Civil marriages are dissolved according to the rules and procedures set out in the Divorce Act.Marriages in terms of African Customary Law are dissolved according to the civil law but some of the consequences are determined by custom and tradition.Muslim and Hindi marriages are dissolved in terms of the rites and rituals of the religion.There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in a divorce, includingCUSTODY OF THE CHILDRENBefore the court will issue a divorce, it has to be decided who will look after the children.The parents can make an agreement or the court can decide.The most important consideration in deciding which parent should have custody is the best interests of the children.The Family Advocate at the court can help investigate which parent is in the best position to look after the children and will represent the children in the court if necessary.If the divorce is taking a long time, for example if the parties don't agree, then an interim custody order can be issued setting out who will look after the children while the divorce is being finalised.In African, Hindu and Muslim customary marriages, the wife usually takes custody of the children.According to African customary law, the father usually remains the children's natural guardian.The children of Hindu and Muslim marriages are regarded as illegitimate, so the mother is also the natural guardian.In all cases, the father still has a duty to support the children.ACCESS TO THE CHILDRENThe parent who does not get custody will usually still want to see their children.There therefore needs to be an agreement about when, where and how this parent will have access to the children.If it is not in the best interests of the children for the other parent to have access rights, then the court can restrict access.MAINTENANCEWhen a couple gets divorced, one party is often in a better financial position than the other.The person who has custody of the children will also have expenses that the other parent does not have.The court will issue a maintenance order requiring maintenance to be paid for the children and, depending on the circumstances, to the other party.Maintenance for the children is paid to the parent who has custody (but it is important to remember that this is the child's right and not the parent's).All parents have a duty to support their children, including children who are illegitimate.If there are problems with maintenance after the divorce has gone through, these can be taken to the Maintenance officer at the Magistrates Court.Whether one party will have to pay maintenance or support to the other party depends on the circumstances.If the parties cannot agree on how much should be paid then the court will decide.Because Hindu or Muslim marriages are not fully recognised as legal marriages, the wife has no legal status to claim support after divorce.DIVIDING UP PROPERTYHow the family property will be divided up depends on what property regime the couple adopted when they got married.This will usually be covered in the ante-nuptial agreement if there is one or, if there is no pre-marital contract, then it is determined by law.The default legal position is that civil marriages are in community of property with accrual.This means that everything that you own is shared, including property and debts.Accrual means that everything that you earn or buy after you have married also becomes part of the joint estate.If you get divorced, the shared property is divided equally between you.Any debts are also shared.If you sign an ante-nuptial agreement, you can choose to get married:* in community of property* out of community of property without accrual* out of community of property with accrual.If the marriage is out of community of property without accrual, then each person keeps their own property from before the marriage and keeps whatever they earn or acquire during the marriage.If the marriage is out of community of property with accrual then each person keeps their own property from before the marriage but anything that is accumulated during the marriage is shared.Some things, like inheritances or gifts remain separate.The default property regime has changed for different people at different times.The laws that were in place when you got married will determine what property regime applies to your marriage.DISSOLVING A CIVIL MARRIAGEA civil marriage needs to be dissolved by a court.Grounds for divorceYou can only get a divorce if you show the court that there has been an "irretrievable breakdown" of the marriage or that one of the spouses is mentally ill or continuously unconscious.Irretrievable breakdown means that the couple can no longer live together and there is no reasonable chance of them resolving their differences.Proof of this can include evidence showing that:* The couple have not lived together for a while.* One partner cheated on the other.* One partner left the other.* One partner abused the other.* The couple no longer love each other.You can get a divorce if your partner has been institutionalised for mental illness for at least two years and doctors don't think that they will ever recover.You can get divorced if your partner has been unconscious for at least six months and doctors don't believe that they will ever recover.The divorce processIf you want to ask the court to issue a divorce you need to prepare a summons dealing with:* Who will have custody of the children.* How the parent who does not have custody will access the children.* Who will receive maintenance, how much it will be and how and when it will be paid.* How your property will be divided up.If you and your partner can reach a settlement agreement before the summons is issued, this will make the process much quicker and easier.If you reach an agreement, you should write it down and sign it.This consent paper should then be attached to the divorce summons.A hearing date will be set.At this hearing, the judge will ask questions to confirm the information in the summons.Once everything is settled, a divorce order will be granted.If you use the Family Court instead of a High Court your divorce may go through more quickly and more cheaply.DISSOLVING A MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF AFRICAN CUSTOMARY LAWCustomary marriages are similar to civil marriages in that the court must issue the divorce order and the divorce will only be granted if there are grounds for divorce (that is irretrievable breakdown, mental illness or continuous unconsciousness).The parties can decide the terms of the divorce and then the judge will issue the relevant orders regarding custody and maintenance.If the court has to decide on these matters it will take into account any arrangements that may have been made in terms of customary law.The wife's family may have to return all or part of the lobola to the husband's family, unless the husband publicly rejected his wife for no reason at all.DISSOLVING A MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF THE MUSLIM AND HINDU RELIGIONSIf a man and woman were married by an imam in the Muslim religion or a priest in the Hindu religion, they are not married in terms of the civil law.They can then divorce without going to court but they must follow the rules of their religion.* Divorce Act, 1979 (Act)* Divorce Amendment Act, 95 of 1996 (Act)Home >

2004SOURCE: Department of Local Government (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)The Department of Local Government in the Western Cape as part of our mandate to strengthen, monitor and capacitate local government with a focus on developmental local government, has invited district municipalities to nominate candidates for the first ever bursary awarded by this department.The aim of the bursaries is to make it possible for previously disadvantaged municipal officials to undertake tertiary studies in the field of Development Management.It is with pride that I can announce that the first ever recipient of the bursary for part-time study for a MPHIL in Sustainable Development has been awarded to Mr Ralph Links from the Central Karoo District Municipality.Mr Links already took up his bursary and commenced his studies during February 2004.This initiative is part of a departmental programme to foster skills in developmental studies in the local government sphere.It is in our common interest that formerly disadvantaged municipal officials receive the necessary training and to equip them with the necessary skills to benefit local government in the Western Cape.With interventions, such as bursaries for further tertiary studies and extensive training certificate courses aimed at management of municipalities with specific focus on female middle/senior level municipal officials, municipal management trainees and potential municipal management trainees to achieve demographic representativity the Department of Local Government has taken the responsibility to ensure that this goal is achieved.This is part of our common efforts and is reflected in my Ministry and Department's Vision, which is "Developmental Local Government through Partnerships and Co-responsibility".Jan Bosman083-7755-312The content on this page was last updated on 21 April 2004Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > News > Statement by Minister of Agriculture on Suspected Avian InfluenzaStatement by Minister of Agriculture on Suspected Avian Influenza5 August 2004Suspected Avian Influenza - Western Cape AlertThe National Department of Agriculture informed us that three ostrich farms in the Cradock-, Somerset East Region in the Eastern Cape reported serious mortalities apparently due to Avian Influenza (bird flu).On request, samples were sent to the Western Cape Veterinarian Laboratories and were provisionally diagnosed as the high pathogenic AI (which caused major mortalities in the East early in 2004).The diagnosis has not been confirmed yet.As the disease could pose a serious threat to the export of ostrich meat from the Ostrich Exports Abattoirs in the Western Cape, we have requested the Eastern Cape, not to send birds for slaughtering to the Western Cape, until we have more clarity on the infection.The EU will immediately revoke our export status should the disease spread to the Western Cape.A meeting between the NDA and the Department of Agriculture in the Eastern Cape was held on Monday, 2 August 2004 at Bisho, in order to discuss the situation and it was confirmed that a ban was put on the movement of ostriches from the Eastern Cape to the Western Cape.By the end of this week we should have a much clearer picture of the type of virus concerned as well as the extent of the infections in the Western Cape.Our most important priority is to protect the Ostrich Industry of the Western Cape.It was therefore necessary to engage with disaster management in the Province and all systems were put in place with road controls and movement monitoring in the Karoo and Oudtshoorn areas.Enquiries: Alie van JaarsveldTel: 021 483 4700Cell: 084 604 6702Dr Gideon BrücknerCell: 083 641 5163Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > News > Feedback from Cabinet LekgotlaFeedback from Cabinet LekgotlaThe Provincial Cabinet and Provincial Heads of Departments met this Tuesday and Wednesday in a Lekgotla in Saldanha Bay on the West Coast.Arising from the Lekgotla, I am able to convey the following:100 Days - 20 Deposit programme:The 100 Days ends on Sunday, 5 September.We are on track to success with all 20 Deposits on the people's contract in our Province as I announced them in my State of the Province address on 28 June.These signify the developmental, pro-poor and legacy correcting commitment and approach of this Government.Important markers amongst the 20 Deposits that must be noted include:1. The arrest of the first alleged 'high flyer' criminal: Mujahid Daniels and successful opposition of his bail application.He has been charged with drug dealing, perlemoen smuggling, murder and housebreaking.We are on course with the other 'high flyer' within the 100 days programme.2. Arising from the first successful conviction under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act [POCA], between 7 and 11 members of each of the Mongrels, Cisko Yakkies, American and Corner Boy gangs have been arrested and charged.3. I will switch on the power at the last of the six schools to be electrified, St Boniface in Rietpoort on 31 August.5. The new Railway Police will be deployed this January 2005.6. A big surprise can be expected too in the total of HIV+ citizens receiving ARV therapy in our Province.7. The Athlone Taxi Office has been opened8. The Expanded Public Works programme will be opened by President Mbeki on 4 September9. The launch on 1 September of Accessible Government10. The Provincial Development Council amendment bill and Western Cape Youth Commission bill have been signed by Cabinet and will be handed to Parliament11. The Clanwilliam Agricultural College, Augsburg for emerging farmers is being opened tomorrowEach of these Deposits will be unrolled over the next month as we complete the first 100 days and secure the patience and goodwill of the people of the Province.Unfolding the medium term:We are concerned that the great backlog in our Province means that we can never allow iKapa elihlumayo, our strategy to grow and share the Cape to become a mere slogan.To build confidence, it is essential that we focus on the medium term and underpin iKapa elihlumayo with the strategies, plans and frameworks needed to fight poverty.We must also signal through our own confidence and work that the Western Cape is open for business.Investors, businesses and entrepreneurs, both domestically and internationally have looked for these signs from us.For the first time, our Province can anticipate integrated strategies including the following:* Micro Economic Strategy* Provincial Infrastructure Plan* Spatial Development Framework* Social Capital Strategy* Human Resource Development StrategyThese will all be completed by June 2005 and will be reinforced by our health transformation programme: Health 2010, our preparations for the World Cup in 2010, our fight against crime, our transformation of the State and our empowerment drive in one harmonious plan to achieve our goal.Terror threat:I am reassured by this, as I know we all will be.The Western Cape is safe and we have no reason to expect attacks.I have every confidence in inviting visitors and reassuring citizens that we are still the safe part of the world that was acknowledged by the international community after 9/11.It is unfortunate that this sort of reporting is casually relayed to the world, doing great harm to our efforts in terms of business confidence, tourism and relationships amongst us as citizens.All people from the Western Cape, including the Muslim community are fully behind our Government's work to fight and poverty and to build the bridges necessary to the Home for All.We need this inclusive climate to succeed.We must recall too that even at the height of the urban terror that we experienced in the nineties, the state was able to limit human casualties and damage to a large extent.This was followed by successful convictions.Premier Ebrahim RasoolFor any further enquiries, please

2004On Saturday, 14 August 2004 women from Driftstands, Delft and surrounding areas gathered at the Driftsands Nature Reserve, Environmental Education Centre to learn how to grow indigenous water wise gardens, how to make arts and crafts from recycled materials and be presented with interesting discussions about the environment.Minister Tasneem Essop opened the event as it formed part of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning's (EA&DP) Women's Month Programme which aimed to empower women with skills they can not only use in their day-to-day lives, but also to create small businesses from.The South African National Botanical Institute taught the participants how to get the best from the soil.The department discussed the projects they will embark upon to empower women and the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board Cape Metro Unit presented different types of plants, which can make a difference in daily living.In addition to this, chainsaw-bearing women from Vusithemba (to awaken hope) demonstrated their work in cutting down alien vegetation and using bluegum trees to make recreational park facilities for their local communities.The Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board Cape Metro Unit (WCNCB) and the National Botanical Institute (NBI), co-hosted the event.More information

historical moment in the lives of the farm worker community is taking place on 17 and 18 August 2004.For the first time an opportunity has been created for the farm worker community to enter into a dialogue with role-players in Agriculture in order to become full partners in mapping out the future of Agriculture.For much too long discussion about, for and on behalf of farm workers took place.As Minister of Agriculture, I took the initiative to call a farm workers indaba on 17 and 18 August 2004 at Elsenburg with the aim of affording the farm worker community the opportunity to come to the table to talk for themselves.The indaba will act as a point of departure in a bigger process in the interest of the farm worker community.The aim of the indaba is to allow the farm worker community and the different Government structures, NGO's, Organised Agriculture and others to enter into discussions in a spirit of reconciliation to determine the gap between the service providers and the users.Government departments will have the opportunity to introduce their policy frameworks and services.On the other hand, farm workers will be able to raise their need for services and highlight the issues of concern.Thus the theme: Farm worker in dialogue.Topics such as rural education; economic empowerment; violence and safety; social structures and sport; the value of labour legislation; housing; health; women; children and disabled persons will be on the agenda.The end result: Farmworkers in Action.Cell: 084 6046701The content on this page was last updated on 18

Charting the Way ForwardOn Celebrating the Matrics of 2004 and Charting the Way ForwardBY: Mr Cameron Dugmore, Provincial Minister of EducationAT: Leewenhof, Cape Town29 December 2004Premier and Mrs RasoolFellow Cabinet ColleaguesMayors, CouncillorsSG, and other senior officials from my departmentRepresentatives of Teacher, Governing Body and Student OrganisationsI want to thank the many learners and parents who were able to attend at short notice such a joyous occasion.I am sure the parents of the learners who were contacted yesterday by the department must have been very anxious and proud to hear they had been invited to the Premier's residence.Congratulations to all our Matriculants who have passed.You have made all of us proud, your parents and the communities you represent.For those who were not successful, this is not the end of the world.I want to encourage you to enrol for the supplementary examination before 18 January 2005.Use every day you have to improve your skills.Volunteer, work part time, read, teach, learn and discover every waking hour.A new dawn is rising over us, over you and Africa.Tomorrow will be better than yesterday.And today, in these beautiful gardens of Leeuwenhof, where slaves toiled for their masters, we now hold the light which gives us hope.This year the Western Cape achieved an 85% pass rate.However, my Ministry is fully aware that the top performers have historically emerged from advantaged communities.These learners have done the Western Cape proud.Further, we realize that the pass rate fails to reflect the high percentage of learners who drop out due largely through socio-economic factors before they reach matric.Hulle is die lig wat brand en nooit doodgaan nie.In order to meet the enormous challenges we face in education, the department will seek partnerships with labour, business, local government, NGO's and other social partners.We realize schools cannot operate in a vacuum and require wider, sustained support.The new look Western Cape Education Foundation, which will be launched next year, will blend this partnership into a real vehicle for transformation, equity and quality.Arguably the Western Cape government has been haunted by the spectre of apartheid for longer than other provinces, which has required my Ministry to challenge a deeply entrenched status quo.Within a short space of time the Department of Education has initiated the following interventions:* Stabilized the teaching profession by obtaining additional funding from the provincial treasury, to save 1,800 teaching posts and employ 365 more teachers next year.I want to the thank the Premier, MEC Brown and my Minister, Minister Naledi Pandor, for their support in what was a difficult time.* Laid the basis to increase the number of maths HG passes from 4,000 this year to 8,000 in 2009.* Initiated a land audit of unutilised education property for possible alienation to generate additional funds to build the 65 schools we need, faster.Furthermore, the Western Cape Education Department is committed to improving performance, enhancing accountability by doing the following:* Making sure that actual teaching starts in all schools on 19 January 2005, the day school starts, and we will closely monitor the quality of tuition in schools at risk* Redeploying some of our district and head office staff, including circuit managers, so that they will be optimally used and held accountable* Reviewing the results of grade 8 to 11 to ensure throughput and ensure that the areas of maths, science and accounting are prioritised* Aligning our human resource strategy so that it supports all bands of education and develops learners with knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to contribute to the provincial economy, fighting poverty and creating work* Make sure every high school has a computer lab by the end of next year, and in partnership with Multi-Choice, equip our schools with a sattelite dish, television and VCR set.I have asked each mayor to consider the allocation of a bursary or cash prize for the best overall matriculant in their municipality, as well as to the best maths, science and accountancy higher grade learners from historically disadvantaged schools in their towns.I would like to thank those Mayors who have already taken up my request.There is much to celebrate.A significant number of our schools have increased the number of learners who passed the Senior Certificate from 2003 to 2004.In some schools the numbers have increased by more than 30 learners.This year has seen more learners enrolled for the Senior Certificate examination: 38,896 - which is an improvement on the last two years.The further good news is that, although our percentage pass rate of 85% for 2004 represents a slight drop of 2,1% compared to 2003, all indications are that the quality of our education is steadily improving.The number of candidates achieving endorsement, increased from 10,323 last year, to 10,524 this year - which is an increase of 201 learners.The number of candidates who passed with Distinction, which is an aggregate of more than 80%, increased from 2,170 to 2,202 - which is an increase of 23 learners.Premier, there are also some good news on the subjects of mathematics and science.In 2003 we had 3,938 candidates who passed maths on the higher grade.This year we have increased it to 4,268, which is an increase of 330 learners.In 2003 we had 3,892 learners who passed physical sciences on the higher grade.This year we have increased it to 3,937, which is an increase of 45 learners.This confirms that the standards of our education is high, and challenges the notion that only a well-resourced school is capable of delivering quality education.The schools, which have contributed to the increases in numbers on the quality indicators, are from the entire spectrum of school types - former model C schools, former House of Representatives and former DET.In this respect the number of endorsements from former DET schools has risen from 270 in 2003 to 390 in 2004 and the number of higher grade maths candidates from 78 to 136.Wel gedaan!An increasing number of former model C schools have also, via admissions, opened their doors to large numbers of Coloured and African learners and have continued to achieve outstanding results.Here I wish to mention the Sans Souci Girls' High School, which has achieved over 75% endorsement rate over three years.This school, which will be honoured later has 46 Coloured matrics, 5 White, 18 African and 12 Indian.My Latin tells me that Sans Souci means without equal.The opportunity you have given black female learners is indeed worthy of emulation.In this respect I also want to mention the efforts of Settlers and Pinelands High schools.I am also proud of the achievements of schools such as Harry Gwala, HoËrskool Robertson, HoËrskool Ladismith, Augsburg Landbou Gimnasium, Groot Brakrivier HoËrskool, Swartberg SekondÊr en Diazville HoËrskool.Therefore, today we not only celebrate the achievements of the candidates and schools, but also pay tribute to the principals, the teachers and all our communities, for their contribution towards growing the Western Cape as a Learning Home for All our Children.Premier, this is a tangible reflection of the commitment of the WCED and our communities to your call for this province to be a Home for All.This year the WCED has chosen to reward improvement or consistency of performance while maintaining or increasing Grade 12 enrolment levels.As it is our intention to ensure that learners continue through to Grade 12, learner numbers in Grades 8 to 11 over the previous four years will be tracked.All schools, including independent schools, entering candidates for the Senior Certificate examination of the WCED were eligible for awards.But Mr Brian Schreuder from my department will explain all of that to you.In addition, the SG will honour a new school in Kraaifontein who have truly, in two short years, made great strides towards quality.Our students in Khayelitsha have shown improvement.Quality is no longer the sole preserve of a few schools.I must also mention to you that, this afternoon, the Presidential nodal zone of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha will play host at the Rocklands Civic Centre in Mitchell's Plain for an event to honour their top achievers.As mentioned, I have also asked our Mayors in the different municipalities to do the same in the new year.We are celebrating to reward, but also to encourage our learners to continue their education in FET Colleges, Technikons or Universities.I have therefore approached various leading corporate citizens to assist with government's efforts in building a learning home for all our children, by providing promising matrics with financial assistance who want to enter the fields of science, maths and technology.SAICSA, ETV, Checkers Shoprite, Master Maths, MECER computers are but some who have responded to our call.I want to thank them for doing so.I am looking forward to the challenges of 2005, to work with our schools, teachers and parents, governing bodies and unions, to continue improving the quality of education in this province.We have a vision - a home for all.We have a plan - iKapa elihlumayo and our job as education is to develop the HRD strategy to implement the plan and fulfil the vision.Together we cannot fail.African, Coloured, White and Indian, men and women, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Jew, we will make this province a home for all.In conclusion, Premier and honourable guests, the smooth process of the administration of the exams and excellent results, is a reflection of the dedication, commitment and professionalism of the officials of our department under the leadership of the Superintendent-General Ron Swartz, Deputy-Director General Brain Schreuder, Chief Director Penny Vinjevold, Director of Curriculum Development Jenny Rault-Smith, Director of Examinations AndrÉ Clausen, and many other directors and staff of our Education Management and Development Centres.I want to thank them for their efforts and hard work.But most importantly, I want to thank the 28,500 teachers and 8,000 public servants on whom we depend to deliver education to our learners.We have done well.We have improved quality.Our historically disadvantaged schools are doing it.But there is work to be done.Let us bring the dawn quickly.Let us take the stars from the sky.Darkness, your days are now few, for we have the light in our hands, together.I thank you...For enquiries,

Provide Children with Patchwork Blankets3 February 2004This project was started about six months ago as an initiative of Mrs Van Schalkwyk.The blankets are manufactured by Western Cape job creation groups such as the Chrysalis Academy in Tokai and the Christian Women's Action Group in Eerste River.These groups are compensated by the Premier's Wife Charity Fund with money generated through fund-raising events, while the material for the blankets is mostly donated.Material has already been donated by, amongst others, a well-known Cape Town clothing designer and a leading children's clothing store."We decided on blankets, since they not only serve a practical purpose, but also provide children with a sense of safety and security - even more so when the children are ill and needy.At the same time much-needed jobs are provided to groups who are empowering themselves and others.Participants have the opportunity to donate their entries to charity, and to win an Elna Funstyler sewing machine or 500 Keedo vouchers.The closing date is 31 May 2004.Any job creation group that would like to become involved, or people who wish to donate material, batting or blankets, or wish to sponsor a blanket for R50, may call Mrs Jorietha Henn at tel.

van Schalkwyk, Premier of the Western CapeAT: Cape Town9 February 2004Choosing the Path of Unity for the World Class ProvinceIntroductionWe have great cause for celebration.There has never been a better moment to be a South African, and there is no better place to live in South Africa than right here in the Western Cape.Consider for a moment how far we have come, and how fast we have moved.Ten years is barely sufficient time for the maturation of a great wine; it is less time than it takes to educate a child; it represents one 80th of the age of the giant Outeniqua Yellowwood that towers above the Tsitsikamma Forest.Yet we have accomplished more to bring human dignity to millions in the first ten years of South African democracy than was accomplished in the ten decades that preceded them.We have seen communities rejoined, hope restored and the creation of a new strength grounded in our determination to build our future together.The power of the Western Cape lies in the character and disposition of its people.Through hardship and success in our history our people have been formed with stamina, a determination to survive and to live, deeply and loayally rooted in our province and our country.For centuries there were diamonds that lay buried under the shifting dunes at Kleinsee and Alexander Bay, hidden for generations from those who had no idea of the wealth beneath their feet.Like those diamonds, the hidden potential of our people lay untapped for decades.There were flashes of hope, and those who occasionally rose above their restricted opportunities to shine.It has only been in the last ten years of real freedom, however, and in the last two years when our coalition has governed for all the communities of the Western Cape, that the potential of our people has been truly unearthed.In our commitment to build a World-class Province, we are busy discovering and unlocking the brilliance of rough-diamonds in communities and areas like Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and the Karoo.For the first time the talents of all our people are being harnessed in this building process, and this is a treasure that we must guard with great care.Speaker, the people of the Karoo and Namaqualand understand the effects of drought.They know too that just below the surface of the Earth lie the seeds in which rests the sleeping potential of their region.With the first rains, even after years of drought, these seeds germinate and this world that was dry and bereft of life becomes a garden of vitality which sustains and supports its people.And this is the way the people of the Western Cape are.Our people's character and disposition enabled them to survive trying times and hardships.And with the coming of the first rain, that potential of our people and our province opened up into something that grows vigorously, in which everyone can share, and that can only reach new heights.But it is only the beginning of blossoming, and now that the rain has started to fall we should ensure that nothing will spoil the crop.People of the Karoo know that in that region you find the eight-day grass.The moment it rains, you can bet on it that within eight days the eight-day grass will flourish.Sheep are once again hopeful and run after the new green grass.But the people of the Karoo also know that this represents a false hope, for although the eight-day grass may look fine and green, its nutritional value is very low and it cannot last.In the Kalahari one also finds the N'abbas.This is a Nama word for a mushroom-like delicacy.It remains under the ground waiting for the right circumstances to grow and to be harvested.Otherwise it disappears again for years.If the N'abbas does not get rain in March, its vitality will never break through the surface.And if it is not picked early in winter, it will be nipped by frost.In the Karoo and in Namaqualand there is also the gannabos.This bush is tough as leather and has a high nutritional value.The gannabos can also be compared with the symbol of the Griqua people, the kanniedood - a symbol of the Griqua people's ability to keep on growing and to become stronger in spite of hardship.During the drought the plant seems to be dry and lifeless, but as soon as the rain starts to fall, it seems to come to life again.In times of hardship it loses its bloom, but its roots are anchored so firmly in the earth that in the right conditions it may reappear year after year.In the Western Cape we are indeed showing our character just as the gannabos and the kanniedood do.Now that the rain has started to fall and the conditions are right, the road we have chosen is not one that will bring our people just eight-day grass - in other words only temporary relief and false hope.Economic growth without job creation and sustainability is not good enough for our people.By introducing the right plans at the right time and implementing them with discipline, we will treat our people to N'abbas - the best delicacy there is.Our plans are aimed the establishment of stability and sustainability - dignity for all our people - anchored with vigorous roots as those of the gannabos and kanniedood.Speaker, our Government represents all the people of the Western Cape.No longer are we divided.Today we have a Government in the Western Cape that governs for all the people of this province.We are illustrating that coloured, white, black and Indian South Africans succeed best when working in partnership to build our shared future.A charge to keepI was greatly moved this morning to be greeted by so many children of the Western Cape - from every community - their voices united in song, their faces united in hope, and their futures united in and by South Africa.Ten years old, they are our free-born generation - the most concrete and powerful expression of how far we have come in the first decade of South African democracy.Last February I committed our Government to making 2003 a year of implementation and delivery, to laying the ground-work for addressing both our short-term challenges and their long-term causes.We introduced iKapa eliHlumayo to promote growth in the Cape so that everyone may share in it - the best vehicle to drive our policies and our actions for the next decade. iKapa eliHlumayo is our vehicle to carry every community with us on the path to being a world-class province.This is our charge to keep.During the past two years our Coalition of Hope has established a stable platform in the Western Cape.This Coalition is an anchor creating security for foreign and local investors - investors whose partnership we deeply appreciate in the growth and development of our economy so that we may create jobs for our people.Long-term planning horizonApart from stability and breaking down the barriers between our communities, the greatest contribution of this Government to the future success of our province has been the introduction of a long-term planning horizon - putting into place 10 and 15 year plans to address the underlying causes of many of our most serious challenges.It is fitting that we are able to report, in the last two years of the first decade of democracy, that we have excelled in the creation of solid foundations for expanding our service delivery and building lasting human dignity in the next decade.Unemployment, migration and job creationEnsuring the future for our generations to follow requires us to seriously and urgently address the issues of unemployment and poverty.Our provincial population has grown from just less than 4 million in 1996 to well over 4,5 million according to Census 2001 - mainly as a result of migration from other provinces.This means that our provincial population has been growing by about 2,9% annually, compared to national population growth of about 2,1%.More significantly though, the economically active population in our province grew almost twice as fast as it did in South Africa as a whole.Amongst the most important issues addressed at our recent Cabinet Bosberaad was the need to agree, with our social partners, on micro-economic strategies for the province to meet our targets.Within five years we will ensure R5 billion's new investments and at least 100 000 new job opportunities.We also intend to create 120 000 short-term job and training opportunities by means of extensive public works programmes by 2008.A delivery-focused MTEF budget with fiscal disciplineMadame Speaker, Minister Rasool and his Departments have presented us with a focused and priority-driven budget that concentrates our spending on the implementation of iKapa eliHlumayo.Ours is a budget emphasising both targeted poverty relief and the development that the Western Cape needs for sustained economic growth and job creation.Our budget embraces real fiscal discipline.We will not mortgage the future of our free-born generation for short-term gains.In addressing the backlogs of our past, this Government, in our Medium-term Budget Policy Statement, has reduced the budgeted deficit from more than R434 million in 2003/04 to R366 million in 2004/5.Healthcare 2010Under the leadership of our Provincial Minister of Health, Piet Meyer, Healthcare 2010 was approved by the Provincial Cabinet in March last year.Healthcare 2010 is designed to ensure that instead of a R1 billion health deficit by 2010, the people of the Western Cape will see improved services.The end result is projected to be an increase in our capacity by an additional 2 million primary health visits every year by 2010.Amongst the many other successes in health care over the past year has been the in-principle approval of up to US$66 million over five years from the Global Fund to fight HIV/Aids; and the roll-out of our Prevention of Mother-to-child Transmission of Aids Programme to 100% of pregnant women attending public health clinics.Budget pressures on the Social Safety Net, Health, and housing deliveryIt is important, Madame Speaker, for us to understand both the scope of the challenges and the budget pressures facing Ministers Meyer and Fransman, and their Departments, partly as a result of migration, partly because of the restructuring of health care, and partly because of the expanded need for social grants.The number of social grant beneficiaries has increased from about 362 000 in December 2001 to more than 502 000 this month - and it is projected that the number will reach 550 000 by next year.The single largest driver of this growth is the increase in child support grants - this month we already have 42 479 children between the ages of 8 and 9 receiving these grants.We believe that by the end of the next financial year, more than 93 000 children over the age of 7 will be benefiting from these grants.Similar challenges are experienced in our rendering of health services - whereas migration to the province alone necessitates the building of up to three new clinics every year.Apart from this, and the fact that an analysis by the National Department of Health indicated that increased financing - amounting to about R150 million per year - for the Western Cape is justified, the ever decreasing conditional allocation for tertiary health services will most probably result in a deficit of about R160 million in real terms.Minister Hangana and her Department of Housing are facing comparable challenges.In spite of our having almost doubled the Housing Budget from R271 million in 2001 to R514 million last year, we are unable to keep up with the demand.We must address the under-spending of our Housing Budget.This is a country-wide problem because of new national legislation and regulations, as well as a lack of capacity at local government level, but we must also rectify the situation in the Department of Housing so that everybody pulls in the same direction.Against the background of these pressing budget issues, the Western Cape Government will be engaging constructively this year with the National Government on the composition of the equitable share formula, and the extent of conditional grants arising out of national policy.The new Draft Strategy for Human Resources and Skills DevelopmentSpeaker, we understand that quality education is the key to job creation.The resulting report and recommendations, combined with Minister Gaum and his Department's Vision 2020, will help us to break down the so-called 'silos of learning', emphasising an integrated approach to all provincial education from pre-Grade R, through formal schooling and tertiary education, to work-place learning, Adult Basic Education and Training, and life-long learning.Last year's increase in the matric pass rate for the third year in a row, to a record of 87,1%, indicates that our education and training initiatives continue to bear fruit.BEE Conference and Provincial Growth and Development SummitThe Western Cape broke new ground in May last year when we were the first province to host a conference on black economic empowerment to set the tone for the implementation of iKapa eliHlumayo.In the Western Cape black economic empowerment should also include brown economic empowerment.The Black Economic Empowerment Conference also gave real impetus to the first-ever Provincial Growth and Development Summit which we hosted in November with our social partners.By bringing together Government, business (including agriculture), labour and the community (including women, the youth and the disabled) we achieved not only a framework agreement as the basis of a new social accord for the province, but also reached consensus on the macro-economic strategies for the province.Strategic Infrastructure PlanGovernment realises that our growth strategy must be backed by the necessary physical infrastructure.That is why Minister Essop and her Department are busy with the last finishing touches to our Strategic Infrastructure Plan to strengthen our growth sectors and to direct our expenditure in the first place towards the most critical infrastructure.This will, by means of construction work, also provide job opportunities in the short term and the transfer of knowledge in our poorest communities.Our key aim is to increase the levels of investment in key social and economic infrastructure from the current 1,1% of GDPR to 2,5% by 2008.To address the estimated R1,4 billion backlog in provincial road infrastructure and maintenance, we will also be pursuing with the National Treasury the implementation of a fuel levy in the Western Cape.The feasibility report has been completed and the Province will embark on a process to consult with industry and the taxpayers through a public hearing process prior to any final representations being made to the National Treasury.Increasing police numbers by 50%Madame Speaker, at this very moment we are increasing the number of police officers from 12 000 to 18 000 in the Western Cape.When our coalition government took office in late 2001, there were 11 833 police officers in our province.Last year we announced that 3 212 new police recruits (64% of the national intake) would be added to the SAPS in our province.There are currently more than 16 000 officers protecting our communities and we are well on track to boost this number to 18 000 by the end of this year - a more than 50% increase in just two years.Next month alone will see a further 1 700 new recruits in the province, with another 900 due in May.We have done this to break the grip that criminals have on some of our neighbourhoods, and to secure the streets for our generations born in freedom.That is why we have had the safest festive season in a decade.I would like to congratulate Minister Ramatlakane, Provincial Police Commissioner Petros, the men and women of the SAPS, our EMS and traffic staff, and every volunteer whose hard work led to this outstanding achievement.Murder dropped by 34%, robbery was down 24% and total crime fell by 18,2%.With other policing initiatives like the roll-out of 36 new CCTV cameras at a cost of R11 million to new areas like Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, the strengthening of our Child Protection Units around the province, and our plans to train neighbourhood street committees this year, we are turning the tide against crime.Officially breaking the barrier of 1 million overseas touristsFor the first time in history more than 1 million foreign tourists travelled to our province last year, thereby boosting our local economy directly by about R17 billion.This is attributable to Minister Witbooi and her Department, whose efforts to ensure long-term tourism growth are already bearing fruit.With milestones like the opening of the Cape Town International Convention Centre, the successful staging of the Cricket World Cup Opening Ceremony and the golfing President's Cup, increased numbers of direct flights to Cape Town, and our plans to launch our Western Cape Tourist Guide Registration System in the next two weeks, tourism in the province is on the move.We also plan to pass the new Western Cape Tourism Act this year and to launch our new Destination Marketing Organisation (DMO).It is clear that tourism, as one of our most important growth sectors, is poised to reach even greater heights in 2004 with projected growth of about 6%.We remain committed to our target of attracting 3 million tourists a year by 2010.Fast-tracked and sustainable land reformSince August 2001 there have been more than 4 400 beneficiaries of agricultural land reform in the Western Cape and we are planning to have this number increased to 7 000 in the next few years.Minister Gelderblom and his Department, in partnership with the National Government, have also succeeded in ensuring that 54% of these beneficiaries are women and 40% young people, making land reform one of the most important tools of direct empowerment in our province.To ensure their long-term success, we have also opened a new agricultural training centre at George.This will be followed by the opening of a similar centre at Oudtshoorn early this year, and a third at Vredendal next year.Renewed urban and rural development focusSpeaker, guided by Minister Dowry, the Provincial Cabinet has now approved the business plans for the ongoing development of Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha through the Urban Renewal Programme.In partnership with the City of Cape Town we will be developing central business districts in these two development nodes to a value of more than R580 million over five years.We will also be renewing our focus on rural development in areas like the Central Karoo, to ensure that our provincial growth benefits all Western Cape communities, and not only those in urban areas.In the past year we have also made much progress in strengthening the cooperation and coordination between our Provincial Government and the municipalities of the Western Cape.Our efforts to bring development and increased opportunity to our areas in greatest need have also been a focus for Minister McKenzie and his Department.Through major events like the Cricket World Cup and also through grass-roots initiatives like the Sports Stepping Stones Project, we continue to bring all communities onto the path to world-class quality.ConclusionIn conclusion, Madame Speaker, many of us living in the Western Cape fall into the trap of forgetting how good life is in our province.We forget that the inflow of people from all parts of South Africa, and from around the world, is testimony to our ongoing success.We forget that we have every right to be proud of the Western Cape and that we should be proud to live and work here.That said, we must always remember that much work still needs to be done to raise the standard of living for thousands in our poorest communities.I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation to the leader of our coalition partner in Government, Minister Rasool.Nowhere has it been more apparent how positive this coalition is for the Western Cape than during our Provincial Imbizo Focus Week and the Presidential Imbizo last year, where the people of the province in vast numbers endorsed our Government and expressed their appreciation for our willingness to work together in the interests of their communities.I also take pride in the public service in our province under the leaderhip of our Director-General, Dr Gilbert Lawrence, and the Heads of Departments.The people of the Western Cape can be proud to have the about 68 000 extremely competent men and women in our public service, and on behalf of the Government and the people of the province I wish to thank them.Tonight at a gala dinner in Paarl we will honour our public servants for their excellent service during the first ten years of democracy.In remembering our first decade of democracy, and in celebrating our first free-born generation, we should also remember that the challenges we must still face will be overcome through the same strong partnerships that have brought us this far.When black, white and coloured people take hands and put their heads together, we succeed best in improving the lives of all.Let us join hands to build our world-class province.Together we are securing a fair share for our sons and daughters in the Western Cape.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > News > Ten Years of Progressive

News > Premier Welcomes Investments of R 2.13 Billion to Cape TownPremier Welcomes Investments of R 2.13 Billion to Cape Town19 July 2004Premier Ebrahim Rasool has welcomed the national launch of the Icon development at the International Convention Centre tonight at 19h30 as another sign of increasing investor confidence in the Western Cape and in Cape Town.Euro-Cape [Mandela - Rhodes Square]: R 500 millionCOESSA [Icon]: R 350 millionMitchell's Plain Promenade: R 300 millionKhayelitsha CBD: R 300 millionFilm studio: R 460 millionBudget Insurance Call Centre [Century City]: R 100 millionParliament upgrading: R 120 millionTOTAL: R 2.13 billion"This excludes purchases and transactions, the capital value of new leases signed and upgrades to existing buildings."This R 2.13 billion is a major installment on the R 5 billion that we undertook to bring to our Province at the Growth and Development Summit last year.As a Government we are committed to doing our part as we build the Home for All."It is good to see cranes lining the city horizon as a sure sign of progress and confidence.The construction industry is back in business to build on the skills of the Province and to provide much needed work."It is most encouraging for the long term that this new wave of development in the city is characterised by four important features: mixed use principles, racial and social integration, black economic empowerment and architectural innovation."We welcome the commitment to mixed-use development by COESSA and Euro-Cape amongst others.The deliberate inclusion of commercial, retail and residential facilities in development initiatives reflects the best of current international planning models."Cape Town has a painful history of separation still clearly reflected in racially divided residential areas.The racial and class integration of our physical spaces is essential to secure and expand the Home for All.The fact that the historic city centre is playing a leading role in bringing our people together instead of serving merely as a centre of established wealth is very encouraging."The development of the Icon by 100% black owned COESSA will be a signpost to black economic empowerment.This state of the art 20 storey development on land reclaimed from the sea in 1937 is one of the first of its size being undertaken by a black company."We are particularly excited that the name 'Icon' refers to a 'Wall of Rememberance' inside the building.This presentation will celebrate the leaders who have made achievements such as this possible in a free South Africa.In the context of our vision of becoming a 'Home for All, this is a highly appropriate gesture."The use of contemporary architecture with African references will help transform the face of the city as the architectural treasures of the past stand juxtaposed with the new as symbols or reconciliation, understanding and progress."There are two concerns arising from these important developments:"Firstly, that the movement of the CBD toward the Waterfront in the west through developments such as the Convention Centre and Icon must be balanced.We are committed to development on the eastern side of the CBD as District Six is restored and revitalised and the development of the southeastern metropole through new projects including the Film Studio, Mitchell's Plain Promenade and Khayelitsha CBD."Secondly, that prices should not prohibit access in an environment where wealth is still related to race.As a Provincial Government we welcome the debate on the peopling of District Six, gentrification of areas such as Bo Kaap and property prices as we find means to counter this."The content on this page was last updated on 26 May 2005Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > News > Effects of stronger Rand on AgricultureEffects of stronger Rand on Agriculture22 July 2004The exchange rate appreciation has positive implications for some industries, while negatively affecting others.The state of agricultural markets affects everything from the income of farmers to the trade balance.Well over half of the country's agricultural exports originate from the Western Cape and with 60% of the Western Cape agricultural produce intended for export markets, the fluctuation caused by the Rand's position against the major currencies will in the long-term impact on the Western Cape economy.Agriculture is the only industry, which has gained and created jobs.Statistics have also shown that the average numeration of farm workers in the Western Cape is 25% higher than the average for South Africa.A stronger Rand has the possibility to change all this.In the long-term a stronger Rand coupled with the current draught situation will necessitate structural changes in order to achieve the objectives of iKapa elihlumayo - the growing Cape.Research by the Department of Agriculture's economists at Elsenburg has shown that free monetary and commodity markets still holds the most advantages for the economy, but there is an urgent need for effective strategic planning, financial risk management systems and the requisite contingency planning.This research has also pointed out that parties that have a direct interest in the exchange rate of the South African currency should re-organize their businesses in order to accommodate the volatile nature of world markets and the exchange rate.We will together with other role-players monitor the situation very closely and the fluctuation caused by

Environmental Day (WED) on Wednesday, 2 and Thursday, 3rd of June in Oudtshoorn.While emphasising the national theme for WED, "A decade of sustainability.Our environment!Our future," a more focused international theme, "Wanted!Seas and Oceans, Dead or Alive",was highlighted at the exhibition, taking place at the Bridgton Community Centre, in Oudtshoorn.Learners and educators, as well as the general public in the area of Oudtshoorn were invited to view the exhibition.Schools were given the opportunity to participate in an art competition depicting aspects of the themes, including pollution and waste.Fantastic prizes were won.This was the ultimate opportunity to see exhibits such as a touch pool with different sea creatures, items made of recycled products, a puppet show, community safety by the SAPS, HIV/Aids education, the fire department, and drama and dance instruction to name but a few of the attractions.In addition to this, an opportunity for some visitors to go to farms and caves in the area only added to the excitement of the exhibition.More information about exhibiting items relating to the environment, for example, products, art, demonstrations and more

BenefitsBY: Cobus Dowry, Provincial Minister of Local GovernmentAT: Beaufort West, during a cheque handover to the mayor of the Central Karoo District Municipality for infrastructure development24 March 2004Not one community in the Western Cape has not been affected by the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP).For this reason it is a privilege to hand over a cheque of R3,4 million to the mayor of the Central Karoo District Municipality for infrastructure projects in Murraysburg.These funds have been allocated from the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme and will contribute to the following projects: The upgrading of storm water drainage, new high mast lighting, upgrading of sport facilities, and the upgrading of the main sewage pump station.All over the Western Cape, communities experience the presence of CMIP.Currently 154 infrastructure projects with a total value of R247,02, in all phases of construction are implemented.In the current financial year the Department of Local Government is managing R183,7 million in the CMIP programme.105 projects with a value of R166,4 million are under construction.30 projects with a value of R54,5 million are in the design and tender phase and2 projects with a value of R17,2 million are in the approval process.CMIP funds are allocated to the seven project categories (water, sanitation, roads, solid waste, community facilities, community lighting and storm water).Through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme, the Department of Local Government, will continue to develop and upgrade infrastructure for the disadvantaged communities.The aim of CMIP is to build communities through infrastructure provision laying a solid foundation for the provincial vision of iKapa elihlumayo: Hope, Delivery & Dignity in the next decade.Enquiries: Jan BosmanCell: 083 775 5312The content on this page was last updated on 29 March 2004Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the

Process - Upgrade Of Cemetery25 March 2004SOURCE: Ministry of Local Government and Housing (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Last year the provincial government of the Western Cape was involved in a process of thorough investigations to refute allegations over the existence of an alleged mass grave in Laingsburg after the 1981 floods.Although the further handling of this very sensitive issue is vested with the Laingsburg Municipality it is in the interest of the broader Laingsburg community that the provincial government not only acts in a reconciliatory manner, but is also actively engaged in the upliftment of a town which was deeply divided by these allegations.At present the municipality is busy with the development of a tourism centre and flood route, as a tourist attraction, for the town and to stimulate the economy of the region.Phase one will comprise a tourism bureau/museum, conference rooms, kiosks, etc. Also included is the construction of an obelisk as proposed by Cabinet.The funding for phase one is provided in total by the national Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.The municipality is currently awaiting the rolling over of the funds.To take the process of reconciliation and healing in the Laingsburg community forward the Provincial Government of the Western Cape has requested the Municipal Council of Laingsburg to consider upgrading the former coloured cemetery where eight victims of the flood were buried.This will ensure that these graves receive the same recognition as the memorial cemetery where most of the victims were buried.Today the provincial government is proud to hand over an amount of R200 000 from the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) to the Municipality of Laingsburg for the upgrading of the Göldnerville Cemetery.This amount is a contribution to the total cost of R250 000 which will include water supply to the cemetery, the planting of trees, a 200 m access road, an entrance wall to the cemetery, store facilities as well as ablution facilities.In accordance with one of the goals of CMIP local labour will be utilised and it is estimated that 1 620 person days of work will be provided, of which at least 30% will consist of women.It is a privilege to be part of the process with the conclusion of this Laingsburg chapter.Our Government was determined from the start to achieve three things for the Laingsburg community: truth, reconciliation and closure.It is in the interest of the broader Laingsburg community that all spheres of government now work together to achieve closure.-In addition to this very important symbolic cheque handover it is a pleasure to announce that an amount R1,3 million has been approved for Göldnerville and Bergsig in Laingsburg for the rehabilitation of roads and related storm water.With high unemployment in this town it is estimated that this project will provide 3 520 person days of work.The content on this

Cape Health Minister, Pierre Uys on Nurses Day, 12 May 2004.The nursing profession the world over has produced some remarkable people.Florence Nightingale is an international household name.In the Western Cape we boast with Machelle Crystal Gordon, runner up in the National Cecilia Makiwane Awards and Alec Nicholas Alexander, Western Cape nominee in the National Marilyn Lahana Trust Caring Award, to name but two local achievers in the nursing profession.In the Western Cape 22 nurses have already received provincial awards.Nursing has for years been a desired and honourable profession drawing dedicated volunteers from all walks of life.Today the nursing profession is a highly skilled one requiring trained nurses in a variety of disciplines.I support Nurses Day because I believe that we, as a nation, need to pay tribute to our thousands upon thousands of nurses fulfilling their pledge of service in hospitals and clinics throughout the country.It is a pledge of service to humanity honoring the noble tradition of the profession of always putting the total health of the patient first.Health services throughout the world face the challenge of nursing shortages.South Africa, with its high training standards, produces a sought after nursing fraternity.We need to revisit our nurses' retention strategy if we are to stem the flow of nursing skills leaving the country.A first priority would be creating better working conditions including an improved salary and allowance structure.We cannot afford to lose precious nursing skills desperately needed in our own facilities through a perceived attitude of not caring.May Nurses Day serve its purpose to emphasise our high regard of the nursing profession.I give our nurses the assurance that the Western Cape does care for them.We need you, we admire you and we honour you.You are truly people who feel called to serve your fellow beings.We thank you for your loyalty to your profession.I know it is not loyalty alone that pays the bills at the end of the day, but be assured that I will fight for a better deal for all our nursing staff.Ends statement.Note to eds:Cecilia Makiwane was the first registered black nurse to be recognized by the Government almost a century ago.The awards seek to motivate and inspire nurses by recognizing and rewarding excellence.The Marilyn Lahana Trust Caring Award recognizes outstanding members of the nursing and midwifery professions.The award commemorates Marilyn Lahana, a nurse who died in 1996 after contracting the Ebola virus from a patient.The

Doorns - Alledged Buldozing of Workers' Houses18 May 2004During the course of last week a very disturbing report about a farmer in De Doorns who allegedly bulldozed the houses of farm workers, appeared on television.I decided to visit De Doorns on Monday in order to establish all the relevant facts regarding this matter.I spoke to various role-players which included the landowner, an official from the Department of Land Affairs, Coucillor Freddie Speelman and the executive of the Hex Valley Table Grape Association.During my visit I also inspected the alleged demolished houses.All the relevant parties agreed that the report on television news last week was one sided and contained a lot of unsubstantiated allegations with regard to the incident.This unfortunate type of biased reporting is detrimental to the building of sound relations within the Agricultural sector.It is evident that there is a willingness amongst most of the role-players to find a workable solution in order to enable the farmer, Mr de Villiers to proceed with the planned grading of 80 housing units to the benefit of the occupants as well as the broader community of De Doorns.Alie Van Jaarsveld082 777 7262Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > News > Statement by Western Cape Health Minister Pierre Uys Commemorating Child Protection Week, 24 - 30 May 2004Statement by Western Cape Health Minister Pierre Uys Commemorating Child Protection Week, 24 - 30 May 200424 May 2004Children are something very special to us as parents and it is therefore a commitment of the Western Cape Health Services to provide the best possible protection and care services to our youngsters says Provincial Health Minister, Pierre Uys, in a statement.The statement was issued today on the eve of World Child Protection Week starting on Monday and ending on Sunday"Our health workers are specially trained to identify the violation of child protection legislation and to act accordingly.Our health workers are constantly on the lookout for even the most minor signs of possible child abuse.When children are identified as victims, the health worker will immediately start an investigation and inform the parents."When children are suspected of being an Aids victim, the parents are briefed and the necessary tests are recommended.In cases of sexual abuse or rape, anti retrovirals will be provided.Aftercare and counseling for both the victim and parents will be provided.Social workers are also informed as well as the police."More than 43 400 children younger than 4 years died of HIV/Aids last year.In the Western Cape the health department has already succeeded in providing all infected mothers and newly born babies with anti retrovirals."Children who suffer burns are treated at our special burns unit at the Red Cross Children's Hospital at an annual cost of R40 million.Such children and their parents are counseled and where necessary, rehabilitation programmes are introduced.Burns are the biggest cause of injuries and deaths amongst children under 4 years.It will, however, need a special team effort from all of us to prevent burns and other unnecessary accidents if we want to save our children's lives."More than 1 400 children die before they reach the age of one and another 5 000 die before the age of 14 as a result of preventable accidents in South Africa every year.Helplines partly financed by the province, are also available.There is a Child Care Centre with a toll free number (0800 05555 55), there is Safeline (021- 638 1155), the Child Welfare Association in Cape Town (761 7130), a social services child and family service at Grabouw (859 2283) and at Paarl (862 6182), a child care centre at Worcester (032 - 347 0190) and Lambertsbaai (027 - 432 2639) and Rapcan, an organization in Cape Town (448 9034) which focuses on the prevention of child abuse and neglect."We are proud of what our health services are doing for our children.The protection and care of our children is, however, not just the function of the authorities.And this should not only be our aim during the coming week, but for as long as we have children.It is a duty, which we as parents have tasked ourselves.We may never fail in our duty," says Uys.Ends.Enquiries: Chris Koole, 0827743462Home > Your

and the treatment they receive must be compared with the best in the world.This is only possible though, if we create circumstances wherein our nurse personnel can deliver service of the highest quality." said Minister Uys.Minister Uys paid tribute to the unselfish task nurses deliver daily, during a gathering of nurse personnel."I know that the pressure on nurses increases every day, but I am comforted by the positive inclination of our nurses across the entire province." said Uys."The Western Cape is also, like the rest of the world, suffering from a serious shortage of sufficient nurses, but every day we are busy working on creative and purposeful solutions." said Uys.Minister Uys announced that the Department of Health made good progress to create a Directorate for Nurse Services and that the post will be advertised soon.The Directorate will be responsible for advice to the department and the coordination of nurse related issues.There will also be focused on the concerns dealing with service provision.Minister Uys also mentioned other areas where they are working hard to improve the working environments of nurses:* Frequent meetings with a representative nurses' managing committee where matters like overtime payment and rare skills subsidies are being dealt with.* The upgrading and extending of facilities to create a friendly working environment like the large projects currently taking place at the hospitals in George, Worcester, Paarl, Stikland and Vredenburg.* The awarding of more bursaries for nurse students.This year 2,948 bursaries were awarded.* The replacing and upgrading of equipment.In the current financial year the department spent R174m on new medical equipment.* Nurse welfare programs are in place to cope with pressure and stress, to give emotional support and even to help with household problems.Minister Uys said that on national level, he is part of a process that has progressed very well to look at the improvement of professional nurses' salaries.It is time that our nurses are better remunerated for the unselfish service they deliver."There is no doubt that enough nurses can be directly equalised to better treatment of patients and thus lower casualties.I am appealing to young people to consider a career in nursing.This is an exciting career with many facets and offers the opportunity for promotions, especially if you enjoy working with people." concluded Uys.Communications Directorate of the Western CapeDirector CommunicationsTel: +27 21 483 3235Home > Your Government > Provincial Government

MaqungoHome > Directories > Services > Tax > Paying Income TaxPaying Income Tax* What is Income Tax?* Who should register for Income Tax?* SITE and PAYE* Tax returnsWHAT IS INCOME TAX?Income tax is the money you pay to government from your wages to pay for roads, schools, hospitals etc.The amount of tax that you pay depends on:* How much you earn.* Your age (whether you are under 65 or over 65).* Whether you are a member of a pension fund or pay towards a retirement annuity fund.Examples of income on which you can be taxed include:* income from employment eg. salaries, wages, bonuses, overtime* fringe benefits and certain lump sums* income from a business or trade* investment income eg. interest, rental income, and foreign dividends* annuities* pensions* income from your own business.WHO SHOULD REGISTER FOR INCOME TAX?* A person earning an annual salary of over R60 000 a year (PAYE employees) - after deductions of contributions to pension funds and retirement annuities* A person earning less than R60 000 a year (SITE employees) - only when allowances (travel, medical aid etc) are included in their remuneration* A person earning investment income (interest) of more than R11 000 per year* A person earning rental income* A person earning business income* A person who receives a travel or public office allowance as part of their salary* Members of Close Corporations and Directors of CompaniesYou can register for income tax at a SARS office by completing an IT 77 form.You will need a copy of your ID and an IRP5 form.Your registration will be confirmed within 21 working days and you will be issued with a tax reference number.SITE AND PAYEThere are two main types of tax that are deducted from an employee's salary or wages:* SITE (Standard Income Tax on Employees)* PAYE (Pay As You Earn).If you earn more than R27 000 per year, you pay SITE tax which is deducted from your salary every week or month.Your employer must work out how much needs to be deducted.If you earn more than R60 000 per year, you will pay SITE tax on the first R60 000 and then PAYE on everything that you earn over and above R60 000.The amount of PAYE you pay depends on how much you earn and is calculated from tax tables issued by the South African Revenue Services.TAX RETURNSOnce a year, your employer will give you an IRP5 tax certificate that shows the total amount that you earned and the total tax that was deducted.If you earn more than R60 000 a year, you need to complete a tax return and send it with your IRP 5 certificates to SARS.You must register with SARS before you complete a tax return.If you are already registered, your tax return forms will be sent to you in the post.You can also collect the forms from your nearest SARS office.You can also receive and submit your tax returns electronically using the the SARS eFiling system. eFiling is an electronic tax return and submission service.You can register for eFiling if you are already registered as a tax payer.You will need your tax reference number and ID number.You will receive detailed instructions on how to complete the tax return with the forms.When you submit your return SARS will check that you have paid the correct amount of tax.If you have paid too much tax you will get a refund.If you have not paid enough tax you will be asked to pay the outstanding amount.You can also collect a copy of the forms from your nearest SARS office.You can be fined or imprisoned if you are found guilty of:* tax evasion (i.e. not paying your income tax )* not completing an income tax return* not disclosing all your income on your income tax return.For more information, visit the SARS website, call the Western Cape Call Centre at 0860 12 12 18 or contact your nearest SARS office.South African Revenue Service (SARS)* Income Tax and the Individual (Public Information)* How to Fill in your Tax Return: 2005/06 (Public Information)Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Western Cape Education Department > Facilities > ABET & Community Learning Centres > Masiyile Adult Learning CentreMasiyile Adult Learning Centrec/o Bonga & Pama Rd, G Section Khayelitsha, 7784PO Box 87, Khayelitsha, 7784021 361 3351021 361 1793The contact person is: Mr A.

visit.REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTERING SOUTH AFRICABefore you will be allowed to enter South Africa, you need to have:* a valid and acceptable passport / travel document which covers the period that you intend to stay in the country* a valid visa, if required* sufficient funds* a return / onward ticket* a yellow fever certificate if you are travelling through the yellow fever belt of Africa or South America.WHO NEEDS TO APPLY FOR A VISA?People who do not have South African passports need to apply for visas.This includes people who want to come to South Africa for a holiday or for business.However visitors who have passports from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (including the British Islands Bailiwick of Guernsey and Jersey, Isle of Mann and Virgin Islands, the Republic of Ireland as well as British Overseas Territories) are totally exempt from South African visa control and do not need visas for any purpose.Also, visitors from certain other countries are exempt from the visa requirements under certain conditions.WHERE CAN YOU APPLY FOR A VISA?If there is a South African diplomatic or consular representative in your country, then you must submit your visa application to them.If there is no South African diplomat or consulate in your country, you can send your application to:Director-General: Foreign AffairsARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICARemember you cannot apply for a visa when you arrive in South Africa.Once you get to the South African port of entry, e.g. Johannesburg International Airport, you will be given a temporary residence permit, which replaces your visa and states how long you may stay in the country.This temporary residence permit (TRP) must be kept valid and an application for extension (BI-159) can be submitted at any regional or district office of the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa.HOW TO APPLY FOR A VISATo apply for a visa, you need to:* submit the application form* show your passport (or provide certified copies if the application is posted)* provide two passport photographs* pay the R425.00 or US$47 or £43 visa fee, if applicable (refer to the list of countries subject to visa fees)* show that you have booked an air ticket.If a business visa is applied for, you also need to provide a letter of invitation from the South African company to be visited, as well as a letter from your company.For more information on how to apply for a visa to visit South Africa, contact your nearest South African diplomatic or consular representative or visit the Department of Home Affairs website.There is a R425, US$47 or €43 application fee for visitors from certain countries.* Applying for a Passport (Service)* Yellow Fever Certificates (Service)* Foreign Exchange

& Travel > Travel > Foreign Exchange AllowancesWHAT IS FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALLOWANCE?The Reserve Bank controls and monitors all money that leaves and comes into the country.Part of this exchange control programme is that when you travel overseas, you can only exchange a certain amount of money for overseas currency.HOW MUCH IS THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALLOWANCE?The annual travel allowance is R160 000 for adults and children over the age of 12.Children under the age of 12 are granted an annual allowance of R50 000 each.There used to be a separate holiday and business allowance but this no longer exists.The annual allowance applies to all forms of travel during the year.The allowances are valid for a calendar year from 1 January to 31 December.Your allowance is determined on the

contact person is: Mr DE Van Der WesthuizenHome > Directories > Services > Employment > Claiming Unemployment InsuranceClaiming Unemployment Insurance* What is the Unemployment Insurance Fund?* How does the Fund help employees?* How much money can workers claim?* Can you get an extension when you have used up your benefits?WHAT IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND?The Fund offers short-term financial assistance to workers when they become unemployed or are unable to work because of illness, maternity or adoption leave.The Fund also assists the dependants of a contributing worker who has died.All workers who work for more than 24 hours per month (except public servants) must contribute to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.Workers pay 1% of their salaries every month.Their employers contribute a further 1%.It is the employer's responsibility to deduct the worker's contribution from their salary and pay it to the Fund along with their contribution.The employee does not need a card or any other proof that they have contributed to the Fund.HOW DOES THE FUND HELP EMPLOYEES?Employees who are registered with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and who have been paying contributions to the Fund, can claim from the Fund if they lose their jobs or cannot work.There are five kinds of benefits covered by UIF:* unemployment benefits* illness benefits* maternity benefits* adoption benefits* death benefits.You can claim unemployment benefits if you have been dismissed or retrenched or if your contract has expired.You cannot claim if you have voluntarily resigned from your job.You can claim illness benefits if you are off work due to illness for two weeks.Benefits are paid from the date on which you stopped working.Maternity benefits can be claimed if you are pregnant and take maternity leave.You can take maternity leave at any time from four weeks before the expected date of birth and you may not work for six weeks after the birth.You can claim adoption benefits if you legally adopt a child younger than two years old and you leave work to look after that child.Only one of the adopting parents can apply for benefits.The wife/husband or minor child of someone who has died can claim death benefits if the deceased paid contributions to the Fund.HOW MUCH MONEY CAN WORKERS CLAIM?If you have been contributing to the Fund for four years or more, then you can claim for up to 238 days.If you have been contributing for a shorter period, then you can claim 1 day for every 6 days that you worked while you were contributing to the Fund.If you take maternity leave, you can only claim up to 121 days.The Fund pays a percentage of the wage/salary that you earned while you were contributing to the fund.The highest amount that can be paid is 58% of what you earned per day.CAN YOU GET AN EXTENSION WHEN YOU HAVE USED UP YOUR BENEFITS?If you have used up your benefits and you are still unemployed or you are still ill, you can apply to have the UIF benefits extended.If you are still unemployed, you need to complete form UF139 listing all the places where you have tried to find work.This form must be submitted to the Department of Labour.If you are still ill, you need to fill in form UF140.Your doctor will have to complete the medical certificate that forms part of this application.If the Department of Labour thinks that there are good reasons for you to get more benefits, then they will approve the application, but this does not happen often.It may help if you can show that:* You are actively looking for work.* You depend on the UIF benefits for necessities like rent, food and water.* You had contributed to the fund for more than four years.There are different procedures for claiming the various benefits available:CLAIMING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSIf you want to claim from the Fund you need to go to your nearest Labour Centre.There you will be asked to sign the unemployment register.You will be told when you need to come back and sign the register again.You will have to sign every four weeks to show that you still need to claim the UIF benefits.You must go back to the office and sign the register on the correct date.If you are ill, you must take a doctor's certificate with you to the labour centre.You will be given a white card, which the UIF officer will sign each time you sign the register.If everything is in order, you should start getting money from the Fund within eight weeks of registering.The money will then be paid every four weeks, until all the benefits are used up.If you don't receive your money in eight weeks, you should phone the Labour Centre and ask them to find out why there is a delay.Remember to have your name and ID number ready.You will receive a slip every time you receive money so that you can see how much you have received and how much you can still get.To claim unemployment benefits you need to have:* a copy of 13-digit bar-coded identity document* a copy of your last six payslips* information supplied by your employer (UI19)* a service certificate from the employer* proof of registration as a work seeker* a fully completed registration form.If you want to receive unemployment benefits you need to be prepared to:* Go for training or career counseling if the UIF officer asks you to.You need to collect your unemployment benefits from the Labour Centre on the date they said the money will be there.You have to collect the money yourself and you must have your white card and ID book with you.CLAIMING ILLNESS BENEFITSTo apply for illness benefits, you need to register at the Labour Centre nearest to you.If you are too ill to go to the office yourself, a friend or family member can get the form from the office and bring it to you to sign.The signed form then needs to be returned to the Labour Office.* a copy of your bar-coded identity document* copies of your last 6 payslips* proof of banking details* a statement of amount received from your employer during the period of the illnessYou also need to submit a medical certificate (Form UF86) from your doctor.The Department of Labour will consider the application and post Form UF87 to you.You need to complete this form and your doctor needs to sign it.You then submit this form to the claims officer as well.You will be paid benefits for the time that the doctor has booked you off work but not for the first 2 weeks off work.You will also only be paid for the time that you have not received normal wages from your employer.Illness benefits will be paid to you by cheque and posted to you.Remember, you cannot claim illness benefits if your illness was caused by your own misconduct or if you unreasonably refuse treatment or fail to follow the doctor's instructions.If you have lost your job as well as being too ill to work, you need to inform the claims officer of this because you might also be able to claim unemployment benefits for the period not covered by the illness benefits.CLAIMING MATERNITY BENEFITSTo claim maternity benefits, you need to register at the Labour Office and get a medical certificate on the correct form from your doctor.To register you will need:* Copies of your last 6 payslips* proof of your banking details* a statement of amount received from employer during maternity leaveWhen you register, you will be given Form UF92.This form must be filled in by your doctor.You then submit this form to the UIF claims officer at the Labour Office.The claim will be paid by cheque which will be posted to you.To apply for benefits after the baby is born, you need to complete Form UF95 with help from the doctor who delivered the baby.If you are also unemployed, then you must notify the claims officer.CLAIMING ADOPTION BENEFITSIf you want to claim adoption benefits, you need to register with a claims officer at your nearest Labour Centre.You will need to have:* a copy of your identity document* your employer's details on form UI19* a service certificate issued by your employer* the adoption order* a statement of amount that you have received from your employer during your adoption leave* a copy of your adopted child's birth certificate.You must apply for the benefits within six months of the adoption order being issued.Adoption benefits are paid by cheque through the post.A form will accompany the payment.This form must be filled in and sent back to the claims officer at the labour centre.CLAIMING DEATH BENEFITSThe husband or wife of the deceased worker and any minor children of the worker can claim death benefits from the UIF.You must apply for these benefits within six months of the death of the worker.If you were the husband or wife of the deceased worker, you need to go to the Labour Centre and fill in Form UF126.* your identity document* copies of the deceased's last six payslips* the employer's details on form UI19* a certified copy of the death certificate* a certified copy of your marriage certificate* proof of your banking details.If you are the child of the deceased worker, you can claim by completing Form UF127 and submitting it at the Labour Centre.* copies of the last six payslips of the deceased* information supplied by the employer on form UI19* a service certificate from the employer.* a certificate copy of your (the child's) birth certificate* proof of guardianship* proof that you (the child) are a learner who was dependent on the deceased.The Labour Office will give you Form UF128, which needs to be filled in by the deceased's last employer and then submitted at the Labour Centre.The death benefit is the amount that the worker could have claimed if they were unemployed.This is paid out in one payment.Department of Labour (The Government of South Africa)* Unemployment Insurance Contributions:

Hazardous WorkplaceThe Occupational Health and Safety Act gives workers the right to a healthy and safe work environment.It tells management to set up safety representatives and safety committees in the workplace.It also regulates things like toilets, change rooms, first aid, drinking water, washing facilities, protective clothing, machinery, stacking and packing, ladders, fire, ventilation, lighting, temperature, noise and asbestos.WORKER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHTSThe Occupational Health and Safety Act sets out the workers' rights, including:* The right to information - for example, the health and safety hazards in the workplace and the health and safety rules and procedures.* The right to participate in inspections* The right to comment on legislation and make representations* The right not to be victimised - for example, the worker cannot be dismissed because they participated in a workplace inspection or reported an accident.The Act also sets out the responsibilities of workers and employers.THE WORKER'S DUTIESThe worker must:* take care of their own health and safety* prevent harm to others persons* cooperate with the employer around improving health and safety* give information to a Labour Inspector* wear safety clothing or use safety equipment where it is required* report unsafe or unhealthy conditions to the employer or

of 1997 (Act) (File type: pdf; size: 194 KB)The content on this page was last updated on 4 January 2006Home > Directories > Services > Employment > Claiming Compensation for Occupational Injuries or DiseasesWHO CAN CLAIM WORKER'S COMPENSATION?The Compensation Fund covers workers who:* were hurt in an accident while they were busy with their work* contracted a disease through their work* died from a workplace accident or occupational disease.You can claim if you were injured or contracted a disease while* working (permanent or casual)* completing an apprenticeshipThere are certain categories of worker who cannot claim from the fund.For example, you cannot claim if you are:* a domestic worker employed at a private home* a member of the South African National Defence Force (there is a separate fund)* a member of the South African Police Services (there is a separate fund)* a worker who doesn't work under the control of your employer* a worker who works outside South Africa for more than 12 months at a time.You can claim if you are:* a domestic worker in a boarding house* an apprentice or trainee farm worker* a worker paid by a labour agency.Claims will only be paid if they are submitted in the correct way in the proper time.Claims will not be paid if:* The claim is made more than 12 months after the accident or death, or after the disease is diagnosed.* You are off work for 3 days or less.* The accident resulted from your own wrong doing (Unless the worker is seriously disabled or dies in the accident, then the Fund will still pay compensation).* You unreasonably refuse to have medical treatment.WHO PAYS INTO THE FUND?Employers pay into the Compensation Fund once a month.WHAT INJURIES AND DISEASES ARE COVERED?The Fund covers occupational diseases and workplace injuries.Occupational diseases are illnesses caused by substances or conditions that the worker was exposed to at the workplace.You can claim compensation if you are exposed to these working conditions and then get the related disease.The working conditions and diseases caused by these conditions that are covered by the Compensation Fund are set out in Schedule 3 of the Act.You can claim for other disease if you can prove using medical evidence and reports that the disease was caused by conditions at work.The Fund also covers injuries that were sustained as a result of work or at the workplace.WHAT CAN BE CLAIMED?There are five kinds of compensation:* Temporary disability* Permanent disability* Death* Medical expenses* Additional compensationThe Compensation Fund does not pay for pain and suffering, only for loss of movement or use of your body.The amount of compensation that will be paid to the worker depends on how much the worker was earning when the injury was sustained or the disease diagnosed.If you are have stopped working by the time a disease is diagnosed, the compensation will be worked out according to what you would have been earning.TEMPORARY DISABILITYWhat is temporary disability?Temporary disability is when you are unable to work or cannot do all your work because of an injury or disease but you will get better.To claim for this, you need to be put off work by a doctor for more than three days.If you are put off work for longer than three days, you will get paid out for the whole time that you are unable to work (including the first three days).What do you get paid?If you cannot work at all, you will get paid out 75% (¾) of your normal monthly or weekly wage.If you can only do some of your work, you will still get paid some wages by your employer.The Fund will pay you 75% (¾) of the difference between what you got paid and what you would have been paid before the injury.All medical expenses are also paid if the accounts are submitted to the Commissioner.How long can you claim for?You can claim compensation for temporary disability for 12 months.This can be extended to 24 months.After 24 months the Commissioner may decide that the condition is permanent and grant compensation on the basis of permanent disability.PERMANENT DISABILITYWhat is permanent disability?A permanent disability is an injury or illness that the worker will never recover from, for example, losing an eye.The serious of the disability will determine whether the worker will never be able to work again or whether they will find work more difficult.Disabilities are rated from 100% to 1% depending on the seriousness.For example, a 100% would be the loss of both your hands or the loss of your sight.The loss of your small toe is a 1% disability.Your doctor will write a medical report about the disability.The Commissioner and various other doctors will then decide how serious the disability is.How much compensation do you get?If the disability is more than a 30% disability, you will get paid a monthly pension.The size of the pension depends on what your wages were and on the seriousness of the disability.If you have a 100% disability you will get paid 75% (¾ ) of your wages.If the disability is less serious, the following formula is used to work out the monthly payment: [wages * (75 ÷ 100)] * (disability% ÷ 100).If the disability is less than a 30% disability, you will get paid a lump sum.How long will the compensation be paid for?The lump sum payment is a once off payment.The monthly payment will be paid for the rest of the worker's life.DEATH BENEFITSIf the bread-winner in your family was killed by an occupational injury or disease, you can claim from the Fund.How much can you claim?The amount of compensation that you will be paid depends on your relationship to the deceased.The total amount paid to the family cannot be more than the pension the deceased worker would have received if he/she was ¾ of the worker's wages per month.The spouse will be paid:* a lumps sum of 2 x ¾ of the worker's wages* a monthly pension for life of 40% x ¾ of the worker's wages.The worker's children under the age of 18 (including illegitimate, adopted and step children) are entitled to a monthly pension of 20% x ¾ of the worker wages.This is paid every monthly until the child is 18 years old.This pension can continue for longer if the child is mentally or physically handicapped.If there is no spouse or children, other dependents will be paid compensation (for example, parents).People who were fully dependent on the worker get the same as the widow.People who were partially dependent on the worker get a once off payment that depends on how dependent they were on the worker.The person who pays for the funeral expenses will be paid expenses up to R6 970.To claim compensation for the death of a family member, you need to provide certified copies of:* marriage certificate* children's birth certificates* death certificate* declaration by the spouse (form WCL32)* the employer's incident report* funeral accounts (form WCL46)* details of your income and property.MEDICAL EXPENSESAll the medical expenses of a worker will be paid for up to two years from the date of the accident or the diagnosis of the disease.All medical accounts should be submitted to the Commissioner.This includes fees for transporting an injured employee to a hospital or to their home.ADDITIONAL COMPENSATIONIn addition to the general compensation, you can get extra compensation if the injury or disease was caused by the employer's negligence or a fault with a machine.Any worker who is under 26 years will get extra compensation.HOW DO YOU CLAIM?1. Inform you supervisor or employer as soon as possible (verbally or in writing).Make note of anyone who witnessed the accident.The form that needs to be completed is WCL 2: Notice of Accident and Claim for Compensation.2. The employer must then report the accident to the Compensation Commissioner, even if they doesn't believe the worker's story, by submitting Form WCL 3: Employer's Report of Accident.The employer must report a workplace injury within 7 days or within 14 days of finding out that the worker has an occupational disease.The employee should check that all the details on the form are correct.3. Within 14 days of seeing the worker, the doctor must fill in form WCL4 stating how serious the injury was and how long the worker is likely to be off work.This is sent to the employer who sends it to the Commissioner.The worker does not pay for the doctor's fees.But if you want a second opinion, you will have to pay for this.4. If the injury will take a long time to heal, the doctor must send a progress report (WCL 5) to the Commissioner every month until the condition is fully stabilised.This informs the Commissioner of how long the worker is off work.5. Finally the doctor must submit a final doctor's report (WCL5) stating either that the worker is fit to go back to work or that the worker is permanently disabled.The doctor must send this form to the employer who sends it to the Commissioner.6. When the worker goes back to work, the employer must send a resumption report (WCL6) to the Commissioner stating when the worker went back to work and how much the worker was paid in compensation.The worker and the employer should keep copies of all the forms.When the first doctor's report has been submitted with the accident report, the Compensation Commissioner will consider the claim and make a decision.A claim number will also be allocated.This number should be used for all paperwork relating to a claim.If the worker disagrees with the decision, they can appeal the decision within 90 days by submitting form W929 to the Commissioner.PO Box 955You can contact the Commissioner or any Regional Office of the Department of Labour for more information and for assistance.Forms are available from:Western Cape Office of the Department of LabourPO Box 872, Cape Town, 8000Fax: 021 462 0981WHO PAYS THE CLAIM?The Compensation Commissioner is appointed to administer the Fund and approves workers' claims.The worker gets money from the Fund and not from the employer.BUT the employer has to pay the injured worker for the first 3 months after the injury was sustained.The Compensation Fund will pay the employer back.If the worker is off for more than 3 months, the Compensation Commissioner takes over the monthly payments.If the employer has insurance against workplace injuries then the insurance company will pay the compensation.In these cases, claims are still made to and decided by the Compensation Commissioner.NB: Payment of claims can take a long time to process.The content on this page was last updated on 17 November 2006Home > Directories > Services > Environmental > Environmental Licences & Permits > Fishing Rights and PermitsRecreational fishing permitsPROTECTION OF OUR MARINE RESOURCESThe Act also tries to regulate who has access to marine resources to ensure that these resources are fairly distributed.The law says that you need to pay for the right to exploit marine resources.Money collected through licences and permits are used for research and marine protection programmes.The following controls have been put in place:* Some fish species are protected by a quota system which prevents people from catching or attempting to catch more than a certain amount of the fish.* Certain species can only be fished in open season.COMMERCIAL LINE FISHING RIGHTSIn 2000 an emergency was declared in the line fishing industry because of the collapse of a number of line fish stocks.The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism declared that the number of vessels and crew would be limited.Commercial fishing rights were allocated to full-time line fishers who depend on line fishing for their livelihood.The allocations resulted in 376 fishing rights (2148 crew) being granted.In total fishing rights will be allocated to no more than 450 vessels and 3450 crew.Employers in the line fishing industry are now required to adhere to labour laws and provide security for line fishers.After further investigation and consultations, exemptions will be granted to vessels historically associated with traditional fishing villages to fish for line fish.RECREATIONAL FISHING PERMITSRecreational and shore based line fishing is regulated by "bag limits" which prevent people from catching too many fish.All recreational fishers are required to get recreational fishing permits.You can get these permits from Post Offices countrywide at a cost of R50 for angling permits and R65 for abalone, rock lobster, spearfishing and other permits.Permits are valid for a year, except for permits for species that can only be caught during season (these expire at the end of the season).You should always carry your permit and your identity document with you when you are fishing.You cannot sell fish caught under a recreational fishing permit.For more information, call 021 402 3911.* Coastal Permit

FundClaiming from the Road Accident Fund* What is the Road Accident Fund?* Who can claim from the fund?* What can you get money for?* What is negligence?* How much money can you claim for?* How long does it take for a claim to be processed?* How do you claim from the Fund?* Where do you lodge a claim?WHAT IS THE ROAD ACCIDENT FUND?If a person is injured or killed in a motor vehicle accident because a driver involved in the accident was negligent, they or their family can claim compensation from the Road Accident Fund (RAF).This means that even if the driver of the car doesn't have insurance, you can get money to help you pay for your medical expenses and to compensate for the time that you are unable to work.The Road Accident Fund is a public entity which has been set up to pay compensation to people injured in road accidents or the dependants of people killed in road accidents arising from the negligent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.The Fund gets its money from a fuel levy that is included in the price of petrol and diesel.WHO CAN CLAIM FROM THE FUND?* You can claim if you were injured in the accident.* Your dependents can claim if you were killed in the accident.* You can claim if you were involved in an accident as a driver, a passenger or a pedestrian.There is only a claim if the accident was caused by someone else's negligent driving.You cannot claim if you caused the accident.You also can't claim if you were the only person and vehicle involved in the accident, for example if you drove into a pole.If you were the driver in the accident but are not the owner of the car and the accident was caused by the owner of the car's negligence (for example, if they didn't fix the brakes) and you are injured, then you can claim from the fund.WHAT CAN YOU GET MONEY FOR?If you are injured in an accident, you can claim for:* your medical expenses* funeral expenses* compensation for pain, suffering and disfigurement* lost earnings* Claims for loss of support - If the breadwinner in the family dies in an accident caused by someone else, then the dependants of that person can claim for loss of support.If you were partly responsible for the accident then you can still claim but you will only receive a portion of the damages.For example, if you were 50% responsible, then you will only get 50% of the damages.If you were 25% responsible, then you will get 75% of the damages.You cannot claim for damage done to your vehicle or property.To get money for this, you need to sue the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident.WHAT IS NEGLIGENCE?You do this by proving that the driver did not drive their vehicle in a way in which a reasonable driver would have driven in the circumstances.HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU CLAIM FOR?If you were not in the vehicle that caused the accident, there is no limit to the damages you can claim from the Road Accident Fund.If you or your breadwinner was a passenger in the car which caused the accident, you cannot claim more than R25 000 altogether.You can only claim back money that you have spent or will spend because of the accident, for example hospital and doctor's bills that you have paid.If you or your breadwinner was a paying passenger or if you were in the car because of work, you can only claim R25 000, but you can sue the negligent driver for any money over that.You cannot sue your employer, however.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR A CLAIM TO BE PROCESSED?Claiming from the Fund is a complicated process and the Fund has a lot of claims to handle, so it can take a long time for your money to be paid out.The Fund has 120 days to investigate the matter after the claim has been lodged, before the final proceedings can go ahead.HOW DO YOU CLAIM FROM THE FUND?You can claim from the Fund yourself or you can get a lawyer to claim for you but you will have to pay for their services.There are information officers at all RAF offices that can help you free of charge.You must make the claim within three years of the date of the accident, if you know who caused the accident.If you don't know who the driver or owner of the vehicle that caused the accident was, you need to claim within two years.You make the claim by completing the Claim Form (Form 1).Every applicable paragraph must be completed.The doctor that treated you immediately after the accident must complete the medical report section of the form.You must also sign the form.To make the claim, you need to have:* A medical report.* If a person was killed in the accident you must get an inquest record.* A charge sheet from the police.* All accounts, receipts and vouchers to prove medical expenses and hospital expenses.* A letter from the doctor saying how much you will pay for medical expenses in the future, because of the accident.* A drawing of the accident scene.* The name of the police station where the accident was reported, the police case number and the police report.* A letter from your employer to say how much money you lost through unpaid wages.* A written consent to the hospital giving the Fund permission to look at your hospital records.* A sworn statement from the person who is claiming and from any witnesses.WHERE DO YOU LODGE A CLAIM?You can lodge your claim at or find out more information from the RAF offices in Cape Town:7th Floor, No. 1 Thibault Square, Long Street, Cape Town, 8001Private Bag X28, Roggebaai, 8012Tel: 021 408 3300Fax: 021 419 7417 / 8740You can check the status of your claim online.Road

RatesMunicipal RatesMunicipalities are responsible for providing basic services to everyone living inside their jurisdiction.* supplying water* collecting and disposing of sewage* supplying electricity and gas* building and maintaining municipal roads* stormwater drainage* street lighting* municipal parks and recreation.In order to provide these services, the Municipality charges residents rates.There are different kinds of rates, including:* property rates* water* electricity.WATER AND ELECTRICITYThese rates depend on your water and electricity consumption.You will receive a monthly account that sets out how much you owe.For more information on this, contact your local municipality.PROPERTY RATESProperty rates are:* taxes on the ownership of property (land and buildings)* based on the market value of the property* used to fund various services provided by municipalities.Property rates are paid by owners of all kinds of real property, including commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural and government property.Property rates are based on the municipal value of your property.Property rates are set, collected, and used locally.This means that the charges differ from area to area and that the money collected is spent in your municipal area.The municipal value of your property is worked out by considering the market value of property, which includes land and improvements.Professional, independent valuers registered with the South African Council for Valuers, whose job is to ensure that all properties are valued fairly and objectively, conduct valuations.Once your property has been assessed, you can examine your assessment and appeal against it if you feel that it is unreasonable.Your rates account shows the entire amount that you need to pay for the year.Contact your Local Authority for more information.* Property Rates Bill: Key Information (Public Information) (File type: pdf)* Local Government

> Publications > Public Information > W &gt What is Mental Health?AUTHOR: Department of HealthAn informal questionnaire on coping with stress and answers to frequently asked questions about mental health.WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?Mental health is not merely about the absence of mental illness, but rather the presence of mental health and wellbeing.Mental health is about how you feel about yourself, how you relate to others and how you deal with the opportunities, difficulties and challenges of everyday life.HOW CAN I OPTIMISE AND MAINTAIN MY SENSE OF MENTAL WELLBEING?Mental Health is about finding a balance between dealing with the difficulties in life and using the opportunities life presents for further development.Get to know your Strengths (work at growing these) and Vulnerabilities ( work at overcoming or getting support for these) and learn to recognize when you are not coping and at risk for unhealthy stress.COPING WITH STRESSWe may not feel mentally healthy or positive about life all the time.Generally, our own strengths or resilience, with support from others, can assist us to bounce back from a crisis or stressful situation during which we are not feeling well balanced in our lives.Some stress can be challenging and enjoyable (a new job, different responsibilities).We need to guard against allowing our stress levels to reach the point where we are longer coping with daily livesTHE STRESS TESTTest your level of stress.Read through the questions below.For each time you answer "yes", put a tick in the box.Do you feel tired all the time?Do you find it difficult to sleepDo you suffer from headaches, ulcers or indigestion?Do you find it difficult to concentrate?Do you struggle to relax?Have you lost interest in sex?Have you lost interest in hobbies and other activities which you enjoyed?Have you lost your appetite or are you eating more than usual?Are you always late for work?Do you avoid your colleagues?Do you feel angry, irritable or "down in the dumps"?Do you bring your work problems home with you at night and over weekends?Are you making rash impulsive decisions?Do you find it difficult to make decisions?If you recognise yourself in the Stress Test, you may be suffering from job stress.Most of us feel this way for brief periods at some point in our lives.While there are no easy and quick fixes to some of the problems we have, it is best to take steps to reduce stress at work to regain or protect your mental health.To take charge of the situation you can:* Reset your priorities, where possible: Focus on the important things.* Be realistic: Divide projects into manageable tasks, Recognise what you can/cant do.* Get support: Identify people with whom you can share problem and work out solutions.MENTAL ILLNESSAn important part of maintaining your mental health at home and work is to recognise when you have or may be at risk to develop mental health problems.Information, and if necessary, assessment and advice about treatment may be obtained from your local community health centre, GP or occupational health nurse or clinic.Private practitioners such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and clinical social workers may also be of assistance.WHAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM OR MENTAL ILLNESS?Mental health problems span a wide range of conditions, from milder conditions that could benefit from easily attainable changes in lifestyle and stress levels to more severe conditions which may require hospitalisation and ongoing regular treatment to enable you to manage every day life at home and at work.Some conditions are more likely to appear at specific periods, for example post-natal depression in new mothers, mental deterioration (Dementia) in the elderly.Others may appear at any phase of life.HOW WILL I RECOGNISE THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS?Below is a list of some signs and symptoms in 3 categories within the wide range of possible mental health problems we may experience, to help you do a spot mental health problem check!Where these symptoms or other regular patterns of relating or behaving interfere with your performance at work or study and disrupt your and your loved one's family and social life, it is possible that you have a mental health problem that requires attention.DepressionAnxietyPsychosisDo you ...experience feelings of panic, tension or excessive worry?...have fears of dying or losing control?...fear not being able to escape from places, and avoid leaving familiar places?...have feelings of unreality?...fear and avoid social situations?...become light-headed, breathless or dizzy?... have stomach pains, headaches muscle tension or feelings of numbness ortingling?...Are there times when ......you hear voices, see images, feel or smell things which others do not seem to see?...your head feels empty of thought, your thoughts seem vague and unrelated and difficult to organise?...you have strong beliefs which others cant understand, for example, others want to harm you, or you have special powers and knowledge...you feel others can 'read your thoughts or you can read theirs....your emotional tone becomes 'flat'' or odd to others...your ability to manage daily personal hygiene and tasks deteriorates.GETTING HELP FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMPeople may avoid dealing with their mental health problem or emotional difficulties by "self medicating": They may do this by excessive use of over the counter or prescribed medication, alcohol or other drugs.While this may provide temporary relief from symptoms, it can also lead to problems of addiction without addressing the underlying problem.You may need help to stop if you have already started this practice.People with mental health problems may not seek seeking the help they need, because of beliefs that mental illness is a sign of personal weakness, laziness, social unacceptability or "wishful thinking".The facts are clear: Mental illness, like physical illnesses, can affect anyone.Mental health problems are painful and can hurt as much as a physical injury, and it is best to obtain help early to promote the fullest possible recovery.The sooner you obtain help, the sooner you may feel better.The first step to obtaining help is to accept that getting help is the right thing to do!Help or advice on where to go for your particular mental health problems may be obtained from your:* school or religious counsellor* local doctor* local community health centre or mobile clinic* workers clinic or health sister* social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.The mental directory of services can be consulted for other centers offering assistanceHOTLINESYou may also wish to call a local Hotline to discuss this problem.Anxiety and Depression Helpline0800 567 567Aidsline0800 01 2322Child Line0800 05 5555Life Line021

government information on services more accessible to all* Accelerating the legislative process for the Western Cape Youth Commission Bill and the Provincial Development Council Bill* Intervening to ensure the re-opening of the Novel factory in AtlantisCAPE ACCESSCape Access is aimed at provide the poorer people of our province (who cannot afford computers) access to computers, the internet, e-mail, and information on government services, currently found on the Cape Gateway portal.Cape Access has two projects which hope to do this:* The Rural Community Access Project* The Libraries Project* Bitterfontein* Van Rhynsdorp* Elim* Struisbaai* Bongaletu* GeorgeSimply making use of existing facilities may not always be sufficient, especially in areas where there are few facilities.The Libraries Project is therefore aimed at the introduction of access to computers and the internet in libraries.The libraries in the six e-community areas were technically assessed and three were chosen to pilot the Libraries Project.Valuable lessons should be learnt in the piloting of these library projects, which will guide the expansion of the Libraries Project.The libraries chosen in the 100 days are:Premier Rasool encourages citizens to use Cape Gateway to access government information and servicesCape Access is a long-term programme.Citizens without internet access can, however, already obtain access to the information on government services on the Cape Gateway portal by telephone (0860 142 142), or they can go to the walk-in centre at 142 Long Street, Cape Town.LEGISLATIONThe Western Cape Youth Commission Bill was introduced to the Provincial Parliament on 17 August 2004, within the 100 days of new government.The Bill was then published in the Gazette for comment within 21 days.Once this period is over, the relevant Committee will consider the comments received, before the final Bill is debated and passed.The proposed Youth Commission's role will be to help government plan, monitor and evaluate the programmes of government in terms of outcomes as they affect youth.Some 65% of the province's population is under the age of 35.The Commission will also be responsible for promoting youth unity and patriotism and to serve as the connection with National, other Provincial and Local Government youth structures.The proposed structure for the Commission is three full time members and not more than six part-time members, with a Chief Executive Officer.The Provincial Development Council Law Amendment Bill was introduced to the Provincial Parliament and published in the Gazette for comment on 18 June 2004, within the 100 days of new government.The Provincial Development Council is a statutory board tasked with the responsibility of co-ordinating, initiating and facilitating consensus among stakeholders in the province.The amendment law is necessary to update the outdated law governing the council.NOVEL FACTORYWhen the Novel factory in Atlantis closed, some 300 employees were to lose their jobs.The Premier's office became involved to secure financing for the purchase and re-opening of the factory by a black economic empowerment company.The factory re-opened one day after the first 100 days of government.Back to 100 Day Deposits: Report Card >Premier of the Western Cape (Provincial

Rights CharterPatients Rights CharterThis document spells out the rights and responsibilities of patients in term of health care.For many decades the vast majority of the South African population has experienced either a denial or violation of fundamental human rights,including rights to health care services.To ensure the realisation of the right of access to health care services as guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act No 108 of 1996), the Department of Health is committed to upholding, promoting and protecting this right and therefore proclaims this PATIENTS' RIGHTS CHARTER as a common standard for achieving the realisation of this right.This Charter is subject to the provisions of any law operating within the Republic of South Africa and to the financial means of the country.A healthy and safe environmentEveryone has the right to a healthy and safe environment that will ensure their physical and mental health or well-being,

Court of Appeal* High Court of South Africa* Circuit Courts* Special Income Tax Courts* Labour Courts and Labour Appeal Courts* Divorce Courts* Land Claims Courts* The Water Tribunal* Truth and Reconciliation Commission* Magistrates&rsquo; Courts* Community Courts and Courts for Chiefs and HeadmenThe Constitutional Court is the court which has the final say on all matters relating to the Constitution of South Africa.Its decisions on the constitution are binding on all other courts.There are nine judges who make up the court.The head of the Constitutional Court is Chief Justice Pius Langa and the Deputy Chief Justice is Judge Dikgang Moseneke.This court came into existence in 1994.You can contact the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg:Constitutional Court of South AfricaBraampark Forum II, 33 Hoofd Street, Braamfontein, 2017Private Bag X32, Braamfontein, 2017Tel: 011 403 8032You can read the decisions of this court on the constitutional court website.The Supreme Court of Appeal is the court which has the final say on all matters, except those that involve the constitution.For example, all criminal appeal cases from the High Court end up in this court, unless the appeal relates to a point of constitutional law, in which case the Constitutional Court has the final say.The Supreme Court of Appeal used to be called “The Appellate Division”, as it only hears cases on appeal.Decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal are binding on all courts of a lower order.The President of the Supreme Court of Appeal is the Honourable CT Howie and the Deputy President is the Honourable L Mpati.You can contact the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein:Supreme Court of AppealCorner Elizabeth and President Brand Streets, BloemfonteinPO Box 258, Bloemfontein, 9300Tel: 051 447 2631 / 6029Fax: 051 447 8098You can read the decisions of this court at the here.The next of the “superior courts” is the High Court of South Africa, which used to be called “The Supreme Court”.The High Court divisions have “jurisdiction” – the right to hear a case – over defined geographical areas in which they are situated, and the decisions of the High Courts are binding on magistrate's courts within their areas of jurisdiction.The High Court divisions have jurisdiction over all matters in their geographical area, but they usually only hear civil matters involving more than R100 000, and serious criminal cases.Important officers in a High Court Division:* The Registrar keeps all the official court documents* The Family Advocate must be consulted on all matters involving children, as the High Court is the “upper guardian” of all children in South Africa.* The Master of the High Court keeps all the records relating to people's estates (deceased or insolvent).* The Sheriff delivers certain documents to the parties in a civil case, and also attaches property when a warrant is issued.* The Director of Public Prosecutions, who used to be called the Attorney-General, is responsible for criminal prosecutions by the state.* The State Attorney is the lawyer who represents the state in civil actions (where the state is suing or being sued).There are at the moment ten “provincial divisions” of the High Court and three “local divisions” (which have concurrent geographical jurisdiction over an area within a division).These still use names which relate to the old provincial and homeland structure of South Africa before 1994.For example, the division of the High Court in Cape Town is called “The High Court of South Africa: Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division and its Judge President is Judge John Hlophe.The present thirteen divisions and local divisions of the High Court are situated in:* Bisho (“Ciskei”)* Bloemfontein (“Orange Free State”)* Cape Town (“Cape of Good Hope”)* Durban (“Durban and Coast Local Division”)* Grahamstown (“Eastern Cape”)* Johannesburg (“Witwatersrand Local Division”)* Kimberley (“Northern Cape”)* Mmabatho (“Bophuthatswana”)* Pietermartizburg (“Natal”)* Port Elizabeth (“South Eastern Cape Local Division”)* Pretoria (“Transvaal”)* Thohoyandou (“Venda”)* Umtata (“Transkei”)Once the Superior Courts Bill is passed, there will be a division of the High Court in each of the nine provinces with a name matching that of the province, with some provinces have more than one “seat”.Gauteng will have both a Southern (Johannesburg) and Northern (Pretoria) division.You can contact the Cape High Court in Cape Town:The High Court of South Africa: Cape of Good Hope Provincial DivisionKeerom Street (Queen Victoria Street entrance closed), Cape TownPrivate Bag X9020, Cape Town, 8000Tel: 021 480 2411.You can read the decisions of the court here.Circuit Courts are also part of the High Court.They are sit at least twice a year, moving around to serve more rural areas.They can be contacted through the High Court.The Special Income Tax Courts sit within divisions of the High Court and consists of a judge of the High Court assisted by an accountant of not less than 10 years’ standing, and a representative of the business community.This court deals with any disputes between a taxpayer and the South African Revenue Service, where the dispute involves an income tax assessment of more than R100 000.Appeals against its decisions are made directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal.Tax disputes involving an assessment of less than R100 000 go the Tax Board.The Tax Board is chaired by an attorney, advocate or accountant who works in the private sector and is specifically appointed by the President to assist as chairman of the Board.You can contact the Special Income Tax Court through the High Court and the Tax Board through the South African Revenue Service.At present there also exist Labour Courts and Labour Appeal Courts, which have jurisdiction over labour matters and are on the same level as the High Court.However, the Superior Courts Bill will abolish the Labour Courts and they will be absorbed into the High Court.You can contact the Labour court through the High Court or by visiting the Labour Courts website.Since 1998, Divorce Courts have been able to hear any divorce matters – prior to that these courts dealt only with divorces between black people.There are three such courts, the Central, North Eastern and Southern Divorce Courts, and they are designed to deal with less complicated divorces quickly and inexpensively.The Southern Divorce Court is the divorce court that has jurisdiction in the Western Cape, and it has offices at the Family Court Centre in Cape Town and a satellite office in Mitchell's Plain.You can contact the Family Court Centre through the Cape Town Magistrate's Court.The Land Claims Court is on the same level as the High Court but is independent of the High Court.It was established in 1996 and hears cases dealing with the return of land taken away during apartheid (land reform cases).The Land Claims Court has its own rules and is allowed to conduct its proceedings informally and inquisitorially (where the judge asks witnesses questions directly, rather than through lawyers) and the court can sit wherever it needs to, although its main office it in Randburg.Appeals go to the Supreme Court of Appeal unless the appeal is on a constitutional question, in which case they go to the Constitutional Court.The President of the Land Claims Court is Judge Fikile Bam.You can contact the Land Claims Court in Randburg:Land Claims CourtTrust Bank Centre, Randburg Mall, Corner of Hill Street and Kent Avenue, Randburg, 2194Private Bag X10060, Randburg, 2125Tel: 011 781 2291Fax: 011 781 2217/8Registrar@landclaims.org.zaYou can get Land Claims Court judgments here.The Water Tribunal is an independent body which has jurisdiction in all the provinces and consists of a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, and additional members.It has jurisdiction over water disputes.Members of the Water Tribunal must have knowledge in law, engineering, water resource management or related fields of knowledge.They are appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, the body which chooses judges.The Water Tribunal replaced the Water Court in 1998.You can contact the Water Tribunal through the High Court.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was not a court as such but a different kind of forum set up to deal with crimes related to politics committed during apartheid.The Amnesty Committee had the power to grant amnesty (which means the perpetrator cannot be prosecuted) for politically motivated crimes fully and truthfully confessed, under certain conditions.The Human Rights Violation Committee decided on acts which constituted violations of human rights, based on statements made to the TRC.Once victims of gross human rights violations are identified, they were referred to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, which decides on how to compensate victims.Those who were not granted amnesty by the TRC for crimes committed during apartheid can be prosecuted.The Magistrates’ Courts are the lower courts which deal with most matters.They are divided into regional courts and district courts.There are more than 400 magistrates’ courts in South Africa.They do not have jurisdiction to deal with civil matters dealing with more than R100 000 (unless both the person suing and the person being sued agree to limit the claim to less than R100 000).With criminal cases, more serious criminal matters are heard in the regional courts.This is because district courts cannot pass a sentence of more than three years on conviction of an accused.The most serious criminal matters are heard in the High Court.There are also a number of magistrates’ courts that are specialised to be better able to deal with certain types of matters, such as the rape court in Wynberg.You can view a list of Magistrate's Courts in the Western Cape here.Small Claims Courts have jurisdiction to hear any civil matter involving less than R3000 (unless both the person suing and the person being sued agree to limit the claim to less R3000).The judge in the Small Claims Court is called a commissioner and is usually a practising advocate, attorney or a legal academic who acts as a commissioner free of charge.Neither the plaintiff (the person suing) nor the defendant (the person being sued) are allowed to have lawyers in the case.The commissioner's decision is final and there is no appeal to a higher court.You can contact your nearest Small Claims Court through your nearest Magistrate's Court.Community Courts and Courts for Chiefs and Headmen also have jurisdiction to hear certain matters on the level of magistrates’ courts.They are designed to deal with customary disputes in terms of customary law.An authorised African headman or his deputy may decide cases using indigenous law and custom, brought before him by an African against another African within his area of jurisdiction.These courts are commonly known as chief's courts.A person with a claim has the right to choose whether to bring a claim in the chief's court or in a magistrate's court.Contact your local chief if you want a matter heard in this court.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Local Government and HousingDEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOUSING: OVERVIEWStrategic Objectives*

Lie down and put a pillow under your right shoulder.Place your right arm behind your head.2. Use the finger pads of your three middle fingers on your left hand to feel for lumps or thickening.Your finger pads are the top third of each finger.3. Press firmly enough to know how your breast feels.If you're not sure how hard to press, ask your health care provider.Or try to copy the way your health care provider uses the finger pads during a breast exam.Learn what your breast feels like most of the time.A firm ridge in the lower curve of each breast is normal.4. Move around the breast in a set way.You can choose either the circle (A), the up and down line (B), or the wedge (C).Do it the same way every time.It will help you to make sure that you've gone over the entire breast area, and to remember how your breast feels.5. Now examine your left breast using your right hand finger pads.6. If you find any changes, see your doctor right away.FOR ADDED SAFETYYou should also check your breasts while standing in front of a mirror right after you do your breast self-exam each month.See if there are any changes in the way your breasts look: dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple, or redness or swelling.You might also want to do a breast self-exam while you're in the shower.Your soapy hands will glide over the wet skin making it easy to check how your breasts feel.The content on this page was last updated on 14 June 2005Home > Publications > Public Information > I &gt Cervical Cancer Fact Sheet for Health WorkersCervical Cancer Fact Sheet for Health WorkersHealth Programmes (Department of Health, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)AUTHOR: Reproductive Health Sub-DirectorateA fact sheet for health workers on the nature of cervical cancer, its prevalence, the age group of women most at risk and what can be done about it.FACTS ABOUT CERVICAL CANCER* Cancer of the cervix is the commonest cancer amongst South African women.* One in 41 women in South Africa will develop this cancer during her lifetime.* Cervical cancer is preventable by doing cervical smears, which can detect the abnormalities preceding invasive cancer, known as squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and previously known as cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN).* Population based screening programmes in other parts of the world have shown to reduce the number of new cases of cervical cancer, even when the programs have been less than perfect.* Younger women often present with low grade SIL.Most of these abnormalities revert to normal on their own.Older women with abnormalities, however, are more likely to go on to cancer.* It takes approximately 10 to 20 years for precursors to become invasive cancer.The recommendations of the national cancer screening programme, which has been accepted as official South African health policy, are that:* Women aged 30 or more should have three free cervical smears.These should be about ten years apart.Screening as above has been shown to reduce the mortality from cervical cancer by 67% and is considered to be the most cost-effective option for South Africa.* If a woman has specific symptoms or a previously abnormal smear or there are clinical indications, she may have free cervical smears in addition to the three.* If a woman wants more than three routine screening smears, she must pay for the extra ones herself.* If a woman is 55 or more when she has her first smear, and that smear is normal, no further smears should be done on her.HOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMME?* Education of health personnel about the importance of cervical screening,* Training of health personnel in the taking of smears,* Ensuring the availability of necessary equipment* Ensuring that good records are kept concerning the quality and* outcome of smears, including a client recall system, and* Follow up and referral of clients.* Educating the community about the importance of cervical screening.ENQUIRIES:Marie AdamoTel: 021 483 2684Fax: 021 483 4345madamo@pgwc.gov.za* Cervical

of the Western Cape* Provincial Parliament of the Western Cape* iKapa elihlumayoTHE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WESTERN CAPEThe Provincial Government Western Cape (PGWC) consists of 12 Departments, namely:* Department of Agriculture* Department of Community Safety* Department of Economic Development and Tourism* Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning* Department of Health* Western Cape Education Department.Working with a budget of R16.4 billion (in 2004), these departments are responsible for implementing laws and providing services to the people of the Western Cape.OVERVIEW OF THE WESTERN CAPEThe Western Cape is situated on the south-western tip of the African continent.In total the Western Cape includes an area of 129 386 km².There are approximately 4.2 million people, living in the province, the majority of whom are Afrikaans-speaking.The other official languages are English and Xhosa.The Western Cape makes the third-highest contribution to the country's GDP.With over 170 000 people employed in the clothing and textile industry, this sector is the single most significant industrial source of employment in the Western Cape.The official unemployment figure for the province, 18.4%, is substantially lower than that of most other parts of the country.Information taken from South Africa Yearbook 2002/2003CONSTITUTION OF THE WESTERN CAPEThe National Constitution permits each provincial legislature to adopt a constitution for its province.The provincial constitution must correspond with the national Constitution.The Constitution of the Western Cape was adopted in 1998 and is available in the official languages of the province, Afrikaans, English and Xhosa.PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT OF THE WESTERN CAPEThe Western Cape Provincial Parliament is responsible for creating laws for the province within its realm of responsibilities as set out in the Constitution of South Africa.These responsibilities include creating provincial legislation dealing with:* welfare servicesThe parliament is housed in Wale Street, Cape Town.There are 42 members and 24 seats are currently held by the ANC, 13 by the DA, 1 by the ID, 2 by the ACDP, and 1 by the UIF.The current premier is Mr Ebrahim Rasool.IKAPA ELIHLUMAYO"iKapa elihlumayo", the Xhosa name for a Growing Cape, is the Provincial Government's underlying theme for the 2004/05 Budget and beyond.This vision has been translated into an eight-point strategy that will guide government and its social partners over the next 10 years, to 2014.These are also the eight strategies around which Budget 2004 is organised.For more, there's a strategy document, an extract from the budget, and a pamphlet.WEBSITE:

wiped off the cervix and sent to a laboratory for testing.* The results of this test will be sent to your clinic so remember to go back for your results.Why Should I Go for a Pap Smear?A pap smear detects abnormal cells that may later become Cancer of the Cervix.What is Cancer of the Cervix?* Cancer of the Cervix is one of the most common forms of cancer against women.* Cancer of the Cervix if detected early can be treated and cured.* All women are at risk of developing cancer of the cervix.* The risk of developing Cancer of the Cervix increases as you get older.* You are still at

OVERVIEWProvincial Annual Performance and Strategic Plans* Historical backgroundiKAPA ELIHLUMAYOiKapa elihlumayo is Western Cape Province's strategy for addressing the needs of the people.Its priority is to increase support to the poor, while at the same time ensuring that a larger number of people can gain income through paid employment.The goals of iKapa elihlumayo are to reduce unemployment, poverty and income inequality by stimulating economic growth and participation in the province.Greater provincial spending on skills development and investment in large infrastructure projects will be used to attract private investment and stimulate the economy.The Province will balance this long-term strategy by increased support of the poor through the payment of grants and improved delivery of social services.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDSouth Africa's first democratic election in 1994 resulted in a new political dispensation with nine new Provinces.But there were no provincial structures in place to bring about the necessary transformation.We had to create a Province, and a key part of this was the creation of a working Treasury - so the Western Cape Provincial Treasury was born on 1 April 1995 as part of the new Finance and Corporate Services Department.It was also charged with ensuring that similar governance structures came about in the Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces.The running of the provincial government depends heavily on the proper functioning of the Provincial Treasury.To ensure that the Western Cape was operating efficiently and effectively, the Department embarked upon a process of restructuring to synchronise its structure with the National Treasury.The restructuring process required policy objectives and strategic objectives to be identified and brought into operation.This was done by creating specialised components, such as Public Finance and Accounting, Asset Management, Human Resource Management and Resource Management.This process was finalised during the first half of 2003 and included phases of:* preparing and initial implementation of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)* decentralising financial management* preparing the Province for dealing with real delivery and intra-provincial equity* building the Provincial Treasury to fulfil its role as an independent and professional department* full implementation of the Public Finance Management Act.STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES/FUNCTIONSThe current approved organisational structure should cater better for the Treasury's strategic goals and will help it to address the socio-economic challenges of the Province with the other departments, municipalities and other stakeholders.The Treasury's (strategic) objectives are:* To develop, implement and enforce financial norms and standards.* To ensure effective internal and external communication on financial matters.* To perform IT audits and conduct internal audits on a risk-analysis basis.* To determine and evaluate economic parameters and socio-economic imperatives within a provincial and macro-economic context.* To perfect the utilization of provincial resources, conforming to the nominal (basic) and substantive requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999.* To enable financing of provincial obligations and ensure optimal allocation of resources to improve adverse socio-economic conditions in the Province and, though the intergovernmental fiscal system, to actively contribute to the same ideals at the national sphere.* To ensure financial transaction processing and reporting that will fully reflect the financial position and performance of the Provincial Government.* Treasury: Strategic Plan 2003/04 to

Cape > Department of Agriculture > Services > Agricultural > Funding & Support > Applying for a Grant from the Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) ProgrammeLRAD's main focus is to assist Black people to gain increased access to agricultural land, for use and ownership, by allocating grants.These grants, which the State provides, are free and do not need to be repaid.INTRODUCTIONTHE POSITION OF WOMEN IN LRADLRAD tries to undo the injustice done to women in the past, with regard to access to and ownership of land.Women are therefore now able to apply for the grant as individuals and not necessarily as part of a household.HOW MUCH IS THE GRANT?To receive the minimum grant amount of R20,000 the applicant must make a contribution of R5,000, while a contribution of R400,000 is required in order to access the maximum grant amount of R100,000.The grant may be used to buy land, to invest in infrastructure, for short-term agricultural inputs, as well as for land improvements in cases where applicants already have access to land.You can also apply for the grant if you are currently leasing land with the intention of buying it at a later stage.ASSISTANCE WITH PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING PROJECTSThe Department of Land Affairs will ensure that applicants who require assistance are provided access to design agents, who will help with the planning and implementation of the projects.The Department will pay the design agents appointed in this manner.The grant that the applicants may receive will not be affected.Applicants who possess the necessary resources to appoint and pay design agents may do so without prior consultation with the Department.This will also be regarded as a form of own contribution to the project.WHO QUALIFIES FOR THE GRANT?Only South African citizens older than 18 years, from previously disadvantaged communities, will be considered for the grant.Although applicants must preferably have agricultural experience, it is not a requirement.Persons who had previously received a grant (R16,000) from the Department may apply again but priority will be given to first-time applicants.The amount that a person qualifies for will depend on the level of grant previously received.LRAD POLICY DOCUMENTThis document has been designed to assist readers with information about the LRAD programme, such as its objectives and its key features.It will also assist readers in identifying whether they qualify to participate in the programme, and how they should go about applying for the grant that is available through this programme.This document will also guide readers through the process or project cycle which is proposed for all LRAD projects and will introduce some of the terminology, concepts and institutional arrangements which form part of the LRAD programme.The LRAD policy document is available in English and Afrikaans.To apply for a grant, you need to submit an application form to the nearest office of the Departments of Agriculture or Land Affairs.After officials from Agriculture have done an idea testing, the registration form will be sent to the district office of the Department of Land Affairs, where a planner will deal with the project.Land Affairs and Agriculture officials will arrange information sessions with all role-players and where necessary, appoint a design agent to assist with project planning.The Land Bank will administer the LRAD grant if applicants apply for Land Bank loan financing or wish to purchase a Land Bank property in possession.Beneficiaries can then access LRAD grants directly via the Land Bank.In this case, the completed application form must be handed in at the nearest Land Bank Branch or Satellite Office.Once project viability has been proven, the Provincial Director of Land Affairs will authorise payment of the grant.You can download the application and registration form for a LRAD grant in English and Afrikaans.CONTACT INFORMATIONAnÉle SpeelmanTel: 021 808 5015anales@elsenburg.comThe grant, which the State provides, is free and does not need to be repaid.However, it is expected of applicants to provide an own contribution to the value of at least R5,000, in the form of cash, labour or agricultural implements.A larger own contribution by applicants will result in a larger grant from the State.To receive the minimum grant amount of R20,000 an applicant must make an own contribution of R5,000, while an own contribution of R400,000 is required in order to access the maximum grant amount of R100,000.* Farmer Support and Development (Government Body)* Land Grants (Service)* Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) - Department of Agriculture,

secure online payment system.* Check your renewal notices and tax invoices for both PO Boxes and Private Bags.* Pay your renewal online using a secure credit card payment system.* Manage your profile and address.* Apply for new PO Box or Private Bag services.* Get email and SMS reminders that your renewal is due.Register now and you're set to go.The South African Post Office has a social obligation to provide every household with an address.It currently delivers approximately six million postal items per day to around almost three and a half million street delivery points and almost two million postboxes.There are still over two million postboxes available for rent countrywide.The Post Office's current delivery policy stipulates that all first postal addresses are provided free of charge to clients - including farmers and owners of smallholdings.The following are regarded as a first postal address:* All areas where there is street delivery (regardless of whether the client wishes to use it or not).* Address boxes in areas where there is no street delivery.* Postboxes in areas where street delivery is impossible, for example on farms.* Postboxes in areas where there is no street delivery, forcing clients to rent postboxes.The following are regarded as a second postal address:* If a client lives in an area where there is street delivery, but prefers to make use of a postbox.* If a client lives in an area where postboxes are provided as a first postal address, but prefers to make use of an additional postbox.Postbox rental applies from 1 January to 31 December of each year and is payable before 31 December.A part of a calendar quarter is regarded as a full quarter.When a postbox is rented, two keys are supplied on payment of a key deposit and the rental fee (if applicable).The deposit is refunded once the service has been cancelled and both keys returned to the postmaster.If a key is lost, the postmaster must be told immediately so that the postbox can be fitted with a new lock.The postbox renter is liable for the cost of a new lock and keys (enquire from the postmaster for more information).Bar-coded annual renewal notices for postboxes, address boxes and private bags are placed in postboxes on 1 November and must be submitted before 31 January to the nearest retail office.Clients can still renew the postbox by getting a blank annual renewal form from the counter, if they have lost the bar-coded one.Failure to submit the annual renewal notice and to pay the rental fee (if applicable) before 31 January will result in closure of the postbox.The Post Office will redirect postal items, at a minimal fee, for clients who move from one place to the other if they complete the application form for the redirection of mail and submit it to the nearest retail office.Contact Details:Table of Account Credentials informationboxrenew@sapo.co.zaHead Office: 497 Jacob Mare Street Pretoria

(Not-for-profit means that the NPO's property or income is not paid out to its office bearers, except as payment for work done or services rendered.)* Faith-Based Organisations (FBOs)* Organisations that have registered as Section 21 Companies under the Company Act 61 of 1973* Trusts that have registered with Master of the Supreme Court under the Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988* Any other voluntary association that is not-for-profit.There are a number of NPOs already registered in the Western Cape.Registration of an NPO is not compulsory but voluntary.Registration gives an NPO some legitimacy, and applications for funding, whether to government or other funding organisations, are more likely to be successful when an NPO is registered.However, registration does impose obligations on NPOs, such as having to submit annual narrative and financial reports to the Directorate, and complying with a code of good practice.FUNDING FOR NPOSThe Provincial Department of Social Development provides subsidies and programme funding for NPOs that provide developmental welfare services.Any NPO can apply for this funding.An NPO is more likely to be successful in its application if its services fall in line with the Department's Developmental Social Welfare Policy.REGISTERING AN NPOIt does not cost anything to register an NPO.Only NPOs that have a constitution or some other founding document can be registered.The National Department has developed a model constitution.To register an NPO, you need to submit an application form and two copies of your NPO's founding document (constitution, deed of trust, or memorandum and articles of association).These need to be submitted, by post only, to:Directorate: Non- Profit OrganisationsDepartment Of Social DevelopmentPrivate Bag X901, Pretoria, 0001Or hand delivered to:Directorate: Non-Profit OrganisationsHSRC Building, 134 Pretorius Street, Pretoria, 0002Your application for registration will take about two months to process.However, on receipt of the application, an acknowledgement of receipt letter will be sent to you.A registration certificate follows if the application is successful.It is possible to appeal if your application is unsuccessful.* Department of Social Development (The Government of South Africa)* Department of Social Development (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)* Non-Profit Organisations Act of 1997 (Act) (File type: pdf;

Department of Minerals and EnergyThis publication gives consumers tips on how to save electricity and energy.TIP 1Reduce the temperature of your geyser to around 55 degrees so that you don't need to add too much cold water when you shower or do the dishes.TIP 2Remember to keep the lid on the pot when you cook to conserve heat and energy.The size of the pot should match the size of the stove plate - this can save you up to 25% on the electricity you use while cooking.TIP 3Close the windows and doors when the heater is on and save money!TIP 4Close the door every time you take things out of the fridge and also check that it seals properly.TIP 5Soak beans, samp and other related dry food over night.This will save time, money and several hours of cooking.TIP 6Try to boil only the water you need instead of boiling a full pot or kettle every time.TIP 7Insulate your geyser by wrapping newspapers, old blankets or other insulating materials around it and the hot water pipes.TIP 8Switch off lights, fans, computers and other energy consuming appliances when you leave the room.It will save you money.TIP 9Always try to use appropriate cooking utensils when cooking, for example use pots and pans with a flat bottom, they consume up to 50% less energy.Note that electric stoves consumes a lot of electricity so use the plates and oven as little as possible.TIP 10Use the right energy for the right purposes, for example use heaters for space heating rather than hotplates, use an electrical kettle for water heating rather than an ordinary pot on the stove.You will use about 50% less electricity.Note: Electricity is good for electronic devices but gas is more efficient for heating and cooking.TIP 11Enjoy a comfortable indoor climate both summer and winter by ventilating your room properly on a daily basis.Remember to switch off your heater, fan or air conditioner while ventilating the room.TIP 12Reduce your electricity account by skipping the washing machine's pre-wash cycle if your clothes are not particularly dirty.This will use up to 20% less electricity.TIP 13TIP 14Reduce the temperature on the heater from full heat to a comfortable level.TIP 15Turn off all stand-by modes every time you leave the house and before going to bed.TIP 16Use energy saving light bulbs.They last much longer and use less electricity and this saves you money in the long run.TIP 17Reduce your electricity bill by doing all your ironing at the same time.TIP 18Check you electricity or gas meter at regular intervals and take a keen interest in your energy consumption level.TIP 19Share your energy consumption information with your neighbours - discuss your electricity bills!FUEL SAVING TIPS* When possible establish lift clubs.* Switch to radial-ply tyres because they offer less rolling resistance and have a longer life than the cross-ply variety.* Avoid driving with under inflated tyres because a tyre pressure that is too low not only increases consumption, it also markedly reduces a tyre's life.* Avoid stop-start driving* Accelerate slowly* Do not speed.The faster you drive the more petrol you use.Source:

Traffic, Accidents & Road Safety > Information about Road SafetyInformation about Road SafetyThe Arrive Alive Campaign aims to decrease the number of lives lost on South African roads through raising public awareness of road safety concerns.The Arrive Alive campaign was launched in 2001.Since then road deaths have decreased by an average of 7.4%.At least 270 lives have been saved each year since the start of Arrive Alive.This translates to a saving to the economy of over R450 million.The Campaign uses educational materials and road accident statistics to raise public awareness around the dangers of road accidents.You can call the National Arrive Alive Information Centre at 0800 005 619 or fax them at 0800 111 301.You can also visit the Arrive Alive website for extensive

by the National Treasury as the norm for effective provincial cashflow management.These procedures and processes result in the maximum amount of interest and make up most of the financing behind iKapa elihlumayo.* The Western Cape was the first Province to do its own assessments of actual budgets submitted by departments to see whether these budgets made sense and whether they supported the principles of iKapa elihlumayo.* Everyone concerned has accepted the Employment Equity Plan (EEP).This plan sets out how the Treasury will diversify its workforce to reflect the demographics of the Western Cape.It also sets out how unfair discrimination will be eliminated in the workplace.* In 2002, the Treasury developed the first full Workplace Skills Plan (WSP) together with a comprehensive skills audit which was submitted to the relevant Sector Education Training Authority (SETA).* The Provincial Treasury in the Western Cape and Polokwane in the Northern Province were identified as pilot sites for the implementation of a learnership in public sector accounting which was launched on 2 April 2003 provincially and 20 June 2003 nationally.These are the first Public Service institutions that host this kind of training.* The WC Treasury was the first institution to get full accreditation as a Workplace Training Institution: No other private or public institution in the country has yet been granted full accreditation.This was also a first for the Finance and Accounting Services SETA (FASSET).* Through FASSET, our internal training manuals were redesigned as reference material and course material was developed in an outcome-based modular format to meet the accreditation requirements of SAQA (South African Qualification Authority) and the NQF (National Qualification Framework).* In addition to learnerships, there have been a record number of bursaries awarded to Treasury personnel on our first endeavour towards becoming a learning organization.* There is an increasing focus on boosting own provincial revenue sources.This has resulted in a steady growth in our revenue over the last four years, grossing over one Billion Rand in 2003/04.Other income generation initiatives are being investigated, like the imposition of a fuel levy and a tourism bed levy.* With the 2003 Western Cape Gambling and Racing Amendment Acts 2003, a major black economic empowerment deal was made possible within the casino industry.* We have started the process of formulating fiscal policy, which provides guidelines of how provincial resources should be allocated in the budget and allows for more public transparency in the budget process.* Western Cape Revenue and Expenditure Policy Framework 2000/01 - 2002/03* Western Cape Fiscal Policy 2001 - 2004, 2002 - 2005 and 2003 - 2006* Western Cape Medium Term Budget Policy Statement 2004 - 2007* A Western Cape Provincial Preferential Procurement Policy (2000) has been developed and implemented, which will help in the sustainable development and implementation of a preferential procurement system.* An Electronic Purchasing System (Sourcelink) has been instituted, which brought about a faster response and turn-around time for smaller tenders.* A Suppliers database (2003) has been developed in collaboration with the City of Cape Town.This accredits suppliers and lists their HDI (historically disadvantaged individuals) status.* A procurement Website (2003) was established containing all the relevant information needed by people wanting to tender for provincial government contracts.* A 100% conversion process from cheques to Electronic Fund Transfers was put in place, which is more cost effective.* Due to outdated and insufficient systems that existed for the management and control of consumables and movable assets, the Logistical Information System (LOGIS) was rolled out to 41 provincial sites (mainly at Health) managing stock levels in excess of R1,3 billion.INSTITUTIONThe content on this page was last updated on 7 November 2006Home > Directories > Facilities > Agriculture > Research Farms > Tygerhoek Research FarmHome > Directories >

Empowerment > Black Economic EmpowermentBLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT: OVERVIEW* What is BEE?* What is the Black Economic Empowerment Sub-directorate?* What are the aims of this unit?* What services does the BEE unit offer?* BEE TerminologyWHAT IS BEE?BEE is the broad approach to de-racialise South Africa's economy and to fast track the entry of Historically Disadvantaged Individuals (HDIs) into the business arena.BEE is an inclusive process that needs all sectors of the economy's input to make it work.Government is trying to create real BEE and avoid the situation of 'fronting' which many companies still apply.Each industry sector is responsible for a Charter which describes the environment as it currently is and the environment required for fulfilling Broad Based Economic Empowerment.The Mining, Finance and Oil Industries have finalised their BEE Charters.Other industries, such as the Wine, Tourism and ICT sectors have produced Draft Charters.BEE is associated with good governance and forms part of an overall growth strategy for all these sectors as well as aiming to create equitable market activity.WHAT IS THE BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT SUB-DIRECTORATE?This sub-directorate is responsible for planning and implementing the principles of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (passed on 9 January 2004) in the Western Cape.This Act is the accepted framework for economic empowerment for both business and government.While the Act encourages companies to implement BEE, it has currently no specific penalties or specific deadlines.Many companies are on board, but government still perceives the pace of change to be too slow.The BEE sub-directorate offers assistance to white businesses to adjust their BEE profile in line with the Act's requirements and guides and facilitates the needs of black businesses allowing them to develop and grow.The unit also aims to:* Increase the number of black people who control enterprises.* Facilitate the ownership and management of enterprises and productive assets by communities, co-operatives and other collective enterprises.* Develop human resources and skills in previously disadvantaged communities.* Achieve equitable representation at senior and executive levels of organizations.* Ensure that Preferential Procurement procedures set up by Government are carried out.* Promote investment in enterprises owned or managed by black people.* Promote all aspects of women's empowerment (equity, ownership, gender equality).* Develop means for disabled people to be more active in the economy.* Create and protect employment.* Create and nurture Youth Empowerment (for example, through learnerships).The unit provides various services including:* providing ongoing marketing on the role of the unit to relevant people* providing start-to-finish facilitation and advice service to black businesses* providing an advice service to predominantly white companies on how to integrate BEE into their organisations in a responsible manner* referring businesses for finance to the National Empowerment Fund, the Independent Development Corporation and banks through Khula* facilitating BEE deals on a provincial level and working with the dti on a national level where relevant* providing ongoing resource information on BEE* working with established business organisations across the board (for example the Western Cape Business Opportunities Forum, The Cape Chamber of Commerce and NAFCOC).BEE TERMINOLOGY* BEE - Black Economic Empowerment.* HDI - Historically disadvantaged individuals, also called previously disadvantaged individuals.* Previously Disadvantaged - People who did not have equal opportunities in the past, including black people, women and disabled people.* Good Governance - Accountable, transparent, professional management and leadership.* BEE Charter - Sectoral BEE policy in terms of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 2003 setting out the current situation in the sector and what transformation is required.* Fronting - Tokenism, superficial inclusion of historically disadvantaged individuals.* Preferential Procurement - Policy requiring government entities to source products and services from enterprises that match the preferential factors set out in the policy, for example entities that are owned or part-owned by previously disadvantaged individuals.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Economic Development and Tourism > Economic

CareSome of the most common chronic illnesses are asthma and high blood pressure (hypertension).* Hypertension: prevention, treatment and managementWHAT ARE CHRONIC DISEASES?Chronic illnesses may be inherited, but many lifestyle and environmental factors such as smoking, inappropriate diet, lack of exercise and heavy alcohol consumption are known to significantly increase risks.These factors are to some extent within the control of a well-informed individual, but there are often other factors such as poverty, under-nutrition during pregnancy and in infancy, genetic predisposition and ageing, over which the individual has little or no control.Besides early diagnosis, management and harm reduction, a very important aspect of the service is aimed at prevention of illness and promotion of healthy behaviour.Priority chronic diseases are: high blood pressure or hypertension, asthma, epilepsy, stroke, renal disease, cancer, obstructive lung disease and Diabetes Type 2. (Diabetes Type 1, which is mostly diagnosed in early childhood, is less common.)Most of these illnesses are long-term and while many cannot be cured, they can be controlled.While people of all ages are affected by chronic illnesses, there is a higher risk of the elderly developing chronic diseases, this in turn can result in disability.PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT AT PRIMARY HEALTH CARE LEVELAt primary health care level the service is based on prevention by educating people about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.Every clinic has a staff member who has the skills to diagnose and manage chronic conditions from young to elderly clients.Patients are able to see the same nurse for repeat visits if they come regularly on the diabetes/ hypertension or asthma clinic day.They are given a special card or sticker on their folder and this is used to ensure continuity of care.Counselling and compliance are also part of the service.Doctors/medical officers undertake periodic visits from hospitals to clinics to review chronic disease patients.Arrangements are made by the clinic to minimise patient travel (especially by the elderly) by prescribing supplies of drugs to last one to three months.Staff often facilitate the initiation of clubs and special support groups for people with chronic diseases.In this way a patient can get more information on special care and health education pertaining to their condition.If complications arise, patients will be referred to the next level of care.Some examples of how chronic illnesses are prevented, managed and treated are given below.Asthma affects adults and children.It is a chronic inflammation of the airways caused by an allergy.Asthma cannot be cured, but can be effectively managed by taking preventive medication on a daily basis.Assessment and treatment of adults is done at primary health care clinics where clients are examined, special tests are carried out and treatment is initiated.Clients are educated about how to manage their asthma and informed about aggravating factors including smoking, lack of exercise and house dust mites.Clients who have severe asthma attacks may require emergency treatment and referral to a hospital.Hypertension or high blood pressure is a disease of lifestyle that can be prevented and treated.If the blood pressure remains high for a period, serious complications can develop.These can involve the blood vessels, the heart, the kidneys and the eyes.The result could be stroke, heart disease or kidney failure and even death.At primary health care level, clients with high blood pressure will be informed about how to improve general health and reduce other risk factors for heart disease e.g. exercise, giving up smoking, alcohol and drugs and cutting down on salt intake.If after this the blood pressure remains high, treatment will be prescribed.Clients must return to the clinic for regular check-ups and medication.Serious complications like stroke, heart disease and kidney failure have to be treated at hospital level.Chronic care services at all three levels - primary, secondary and tertiary - facilitate getting social service grants to people who need them.These services are available at all clinics and hospitals throughout the Western Cape.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.Bring your ID book.A referral letter from the clinic will be required when visiting a hospital.Hospitals ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).Bring your hospital card if previously registered at the hospital.* ClinicsHome > Directories > Public Entities > Institute > National Productivity

> Chronic Illness > Eye Care/Prevention of Blindness ProgrammeThis service aims to prevent eye conditions that could lead to blindness, and to treat people who have problems with their eyesight.Eye tests, which include using eye charts, are available at Primary Health Care Clinic (PHC level, and help to check for refractive errors like nearsightedness, farsightedness, distorted vision and "ageing eyes".If you need spectacles, your name will be placed on a waiting list for between one to 18 months.The PHC nurse will make an appointment for you with an optometrist who visits the clinic on a sessional basis.Free spectacle and other assistive devices have become a reality and will be implemented shortly.Cataracts, a degenerative thickening/opaqueness of the lens, are the leading cause of blindness.They are treatable and can be identified easily at PHC clinics and centres, as well as by home-based carers because they are so noticeable.Operations to remove cataracts are performed at secondary level hospitals.There is a waiting list.Diabetics should have an annual eye test to check for the early formation of cataracts.There can also be a change in the retina, which can lead to blindness.In this case the client would need to be referred to a secondary level hospital, where they will be given laser therapy.Primary prevention includes health education, immunisation against measles in children, maternal and health services, and safety promotion.Prevention of corneal scarring from malnutrition, infection and injury /trauma is important.The lack of Vitamin A is a major cause of blindness in children.Chronic glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in South Africa.Ophthalmic nurses and optometrists examine clients at hospitals (district or secondary level).If surgery is required, the patient will be referred to a tertiary hospital.Other useful contacts:* Bureau for the Prevention of Blindness: tel 012 452 3811 or write to PO Box 11149, Hatfield, 0028 Pretoria* SA Optometric Association: tel 011 805 4517 or email pro@saoa.co.zaBasic eye examinations are available at all PHC clinics and centres.If necessary, clients will be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.First-time visitors to the clinic or secondary/tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.Hospitals will ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).Free at PHC level.If you are referred to a hospital, there is a cost involved.The amount will depend on how much you earn and on how many dependents you have, according to the hospital rating scale.THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA - SERVICES: EMERGENCY SERVICESHome > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Emergency Services > Medical Emergency Transport and RescueThese emergency services provide on-the-spot assistance for patients and transport the patient to hospital.Services in the Western Cape are offered by:* METRO Services* Red Cross Air Mercy Service* First aid organisationsMETRO SERVICESMETRO provides a 24-hour emergency medical response for the rescue and transportation of the sick and injured to the nearest appropriate healthcare facility.The Western Cape has a fleet of around 400 vehicles, including rescue vehicles, rapid response vehicles, patient transporters and ambulances.Each ambulance has two people trained to provide emergency medical care.The level of care provided is determined by the qualifications of the crew, which include basic life support, intermediate life support and advanced life support (paramedics).Specialist rescue qualifications equip the staff with the knowledge and skills needed to sort out complex medical rescue situations.The Health Professions Council of South Africa determines education and training standards for Emergency Care Personnel and requires that they be registered before being able to practise.The medical emergency care response and the time taken to transport patients to hospitals depend on the complexity of the medical problem and the distance of the incident from the nearest facility.People calling for assistance must provide the following essential information:* the exact location of the incident, injury or illness* the nature of the medical problem or rescue situation* a call back number.For an efficient service to continue, patient's rights must be balanced with patient's responsibility and people are asked to use ambulance services only when there is a real emergency.RED CROSS AIR MERCY SERVICEThe Red Cross Air Mercy Service is used to transport sick people over long distances by air to Cape Town's three tertiary hospitals.The service cannot be used directly by members of the public and can only be accessed by public health professionals.FIRST AID ORGANISATIONSFirst Aid organisations including St John Ambulance, SA Red Cross Society Western Cape and SA First Aid League give back-up assistance to Metro services and give first aid at sporting and cultural events.Volunteers are an important part of the service and there are volunteer groups in towns throughout the Western Cape.These groups can be contacted through the ambulance services in all four regions (see numbers below).If you want to be a volunteer contact the Pinelands Division of the service on 021 511 5154 and ask for the co-ordinator of the volunteer groups.Usually you will be interviewed and then once you have joined as a volunteer you will be taken out on ambulance calls.You will be required to attend Level I, 2, and 3 first aid courses given by paramedics.In addition, you may be sent for short courses at the Academy of Emergency Medical Care at the Cape Technikon.The courses involve basic, intermediate and advanced life support.These are some other useful contacts:* St John Ambulance: tel 021 461 8420, a/h emergency tel 021 423 3333* SA Red Cross Society Western Cape: tel 021 797 5360, email redxcape@iafrica.com* SA First Aid League: tel 021 948 6294.For emergency medical care phone the National Medical Emergency Number 10177 and an ambulance will be sent out from one of several dispatch centres in the Western Cape.In addition the provincial Emergency Medical Services can be contacted at these numbers (office hours only):Head Office021 948 9908Metro021 511 6154West CoastSouth Cape044 874 7458Boland/Overberg023 342 2698* Tertiary HospitalsNo one will be refused the service based on capacity to pay.If you are on a medical aid you will be charged Uniform Patient Fee Rates agreed with the medical aids.If you are not you will be assessed according to your income and charged accordingly.* Calling for Emergency Help (Service)* Regulations Governing Ambulance Services in the Western Cape (Guidelines/Manuals/Instructions) (File type: pdf; size: 1013 KB)* Western

Primary Health Care (PHC) service detects, diagnoses and treats common mental health conditions, and organises the referral of more complicated mental health problems to more appropriate levels of mental health care.If you are suffering from a mental health condition, you can go to your local clinic where a health worker will assess you and offer initial treatment.In the Metro, Southern Cape Karoo and West Coast Winelands regions, the health worker may refer you onto more specialised care offered by a mental health (psychiatric) nurse, where available.An appointment would need to be made to see the mental health nurse at the clinic as the nurse visits several clinics in a week.The mental health nurse may further assess your mental health condition to enable them to provide the most effective treatment.Treatment may include medication as well as short-term individual or group counselling and support.The mental health nurse may consult with the regional psychologist or psychiatrist (or other members of the regional mental health team) when additional expertise is required.If necessary, the mental health nurse may set up an appointment with one of these specialists for further assessment at the PHC clinic.Additional support besides clinic visits may be necessary to promote and maintain good mental health, and clients may be advised to attend psychosocial rehabilitation support groups where necessary and available.Consult the mental health directory or ask your local clinic or mental health nurse about groups in your area.The Department of Health also gives partial subsidies to NGOs in some regions who offer group homes for adults with mental illness and day care centres for children under 18 years of age with profound and severe intellectual disability.Enquiries about vacancies at these NGO-run facilities would need to be directed to the NGO concerned.

mental health services or secondary (regional) hospitals.The hospital should be contacted by the referring health worker to arrange admission beforehand.Specialised mental health services based at tertiary hospitals, Red Cross, Groote Schuur or Tygerberg would require a referral letter or completed admission application obtainable at the service centre, before the service can be accessed by appointment.First-time referrals to psychiatric or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.Most clients voluntarily admit themselves for hospital treatment.In terms of the current Mental Health Act, when the client has a psychiatric crisis and is not willing to come or unable to assess their own need to have hospital treatment, and presents a risk for their own or other safety, it may be necessary for family members to have the person committed to hospital.In this case, family members should lodge an application for assistance in obtaining involuntary care with the local magistrate in their district.Mental health legislation is currently under review and changes will be introduced to the process for admitting a person for involuntary care when the new Mental Health Care Act and regulations are formally promulgated into law.On discharge from hospital, a follow-up appointment can be arranged with the mental health nurse at the clinic-based service closest to the client's home, to ensure continuity of care.Associated Psychiatric Hospitals (APH) Regional OfficeMrs Volene WerelyTel: 021 440 3300Fax: 021 440

(Department of Health, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Mental > Help with Substance AbuseCommunity-based, primary and hospital-level mental health services for children, adolescents and adults with substance abuse problems are available.Clients with substance abuse problems can access treatment from primary mental health clinics.Outpatient detoxification may be offered at primary level, if necessary.Clients who are dependent on substances may, depending on the substance and other factors, experience mild to severe withdrawal symptoms when they stop using these substances.Detoxification is a medical intervention which helps in minimising the physical and psychological impact, and managing possible medical risks of withdrawal from the substance, before the client goes for further treatment and rehabilitationWhen a client's substance abuse problem requires more intensive services, the following services are available:Regional Hospitals (secondary level) offer detoxification services for people with alcohol and drug dependency prior to admission to the abuse treatment centres for further treatment and rehabilitation.De Nova Treatment Centre in Kraaifontein is fully subsidised by the provincial Department of Social Development and provides in-patient treatment for alcohol and drug dependency.The service is for indigent clients and for those who have been referred by the criminal justice system.Psychiatric and psychological services are given on a sessional basis by mental health professionals employed by the Department of Health.Some NGO-run substance abuse treatment centres are registered and partly subsidised by the provincial Department of Social Development.A few private substance abuse treatment centres are licensed by the Department of Health to offer substance abuse treatment programmes inclusive of detoxification services programmes.Stikland Hospital also provides in-patient services for alcohol rehabilitation.* Interventions for Youth at Risk (Service)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Treatment for Sexual Abuse/RapeAt the clinic, the survivor will be interviewed and counselled by a health worker in a private room/area.The health worker will ask whether the rape has been reported to the police.If, and only if, the survivor wants to report the rape, a police officer will be asked to come to the health facility to get a statement.Women may also get emergency contraception if they arrive at the clinic within 72 hours of being raped.If the survivors arrive within 72 hours of being raped, they will be offered the anti-Aids drug AZT (Zidovudine).Survivors who arrive after 72 hours should be counselled about the possible risk of getting HIV and be given a follow-up appointment date for six weeks and three months post rape for HIV testing and counselling.Rape survivors will be given the option of going for counselling to a social worker/ trained counsellor/private therapist (e.g. psychologist) /Rape Crisis or other NGO.Report to your nearest health care facility and state that you have been raped and/or assaulted.At the 52 centres which have specially dedicated services for women and men who have been sexually assaulted

Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Contraception (Family Planning)The service offers counselling on and provision of a range of safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods from which women, men and teenagers can freely choose to prevent unwanted pregnancy.* Information and Counselling* Methods of Contraception* Useful Contacts.INFORMATION AND COUNSELLINGInformation on the various contraceptive methods is given to help individuals make informed choices based on their personal history and physical examination.If a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) is detected, it will be treated with medication at the clinic or a referral letter may be given to a special clinic.Once a contraceptive method has been chosen, the client is monitored for possible side effects in follow up visits to the clinic.Any girl or woman can decide if she wants to use contraception.She does not need the permission of her partner or parents.Many clinics now have a dedicated youth service so that young people can get information about family planning in a comfortable environment.METHODS OF CONTRACEPTIONOral contraception for women: Pills come in packets of 28 and must be taken once daily at the same time.There are two main types: Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) pills and Progestogen-only Contraceptive (POP) pills.They are free of charge at clinics and hospitals and can also be bought at pharmacies without prescription.This form of contraception does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).Contraceptive injection for women: There are two types: Nur-Isterate, which is given every two months (8 weeks) and DMPA (Depo Provera or Petogen ) which is given every three months (12 weeks).Intrauterine device (IUD): An IUD is a small device that is put into a women's uterus (womb) by a specially trained health worker.An IUD can prevent pregnancy for at least five years.It does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).If a women or her partner has multiple sex partners, the IUD should not be the method of first choice unless condoms are also used, to protect against STI/HIV transmission.Women are required to go to the clinic for a check up six weeks after the IUD has been inserted.It is also advisable to go for a check-up every year.The IUD is available at some clinics only but can also be bought at pharmacies.Emergency contraception: This method can be used by women who want to prevent pregnancy because they have had unprotected sex, been raped or they suspect that the contraception they used during sexual intercourse did not work properly.Emergency contraceptive pills can be taken 72 hours (three days) after unprotected sex to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but the earlier the pills are taken the better they work.Pills are free of charge at clinics and hospitals and can also be bought without prescription at pharmaciesAn IUD can also be inserted within five days of unprotected sex to prevent unwanted pregnancy.If it is too late for these emergency contraceptive methods, and an unwanted pregnancy is suspected, a Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) is available as a last resort.TOP is legal in South Africa.Condoms: Female and male condoms are the only single method that offer dual protection from both unwanted pregnancy as well as Sexually Transmitted Infections including HIV/Aids.Male condoms are free of charge at clinics and some public venues.Condoms are also sold cheaply at most pharmacies and shops.Female condoms are available free of charge at a few designated clinics and for sale in some pharmacies.Sterilisation: This is a permanent contraceptive method for both women and men.Any person 18 years or above who is capable of consenting may be sterilised at his or her request.Counselling should be given before the procedure.It is a short and simple operation that does not affect one's sex life, other than giving peace of mind about unwanted.A booking for sterilisation can be made at the local clinic.Counselling is provided and a request form will need to be signed.The operation is free of charge at some community health centres and hospitals at every level (primary, secondary and tertiary).The doctor who does the operation will ask the client to sign a consent form.The operation for females is called a tubal ligation.The fallopian tubes that carry the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (womb) are tied or blocked.The eggs are prevented from becoming fertilised by the sperm and pregnancy is prevented.The procedure for males is called a vasectomy, which is usually done while the man is awake, using local anaesthetic, or a general anaesthetic.One or two very small openings are made in the skin near the testicles.The vas deferens (sperm tube), which carries sperm from each testicle, are cut and tied.The operation is not immediately effective and another contraception method is needed for three months after the operation, or for the next 15-20 times that the man has sex.A confirmatory test (sperm count) is necessary to ensure that the sperm is cleared from the tubes.Sterilisation does not prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI/HIV/Aids).As with all contraceptive methods, there is a small risk of failure.Mentally disabled people can be sterilised in terms of the Sterilisation Act, 1998 (Act No. 44 of 1998).The parent, guardian, curator or spouse can request the sterilisation of a person who is incapable of consenting due to mental disability.An application must be made and sent to the relevant hospital.An appointment will be made for a panel consisting of three mental health professionals to assess the client, who must be accompanied by the applicant.Depending on the circumstances, the panel will decide on whether or not to proceed with sterilisation.USEFUL CONTACTSThe following private organisations can also help:* Planned Parenthood Association (PPSA) Western Cape: tel 021 448 7312, email ppawc@ppawc.co.za* Association for Voluntary Sterilisation of SA (AVSSA): tel 021 531 1665 or 531 2291* Marie

previously registered at the facility.* Reproductive Health FacilitiesThere is no charge at primary health care facilities and when referred up the line.Ambulance Services are free of charge for clients who undergo sterilisation.* Male Reproductive Health (Service)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Cervical Cancer ScreeningCervical and breast cancer are the two most common forms of cancer found amongst South African women and all women are at risk of developing these cancers.Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer.All women should have a pap smear at least every 10 years starting at age 30 years.This means at around 30, 40 and 50 years of age.The screening programme aims at finding and treating early signs of cancer of the cervix, commonly known as the "mouth of the womb".The screening involves taking a pap (or cervical) smear, which is a simple, quick vaginal examination to check if the cervix is healthy.Some cells are gently wiped off the cervix and sent to the laboratory for testing.Sometimes, results are unclear and a repeat smear is necessary.Women who have had the test must go back to the clinic to get the laboratory results.Remember, the client is entitled to ask for an explanation of the procedure beforehand.Cervical cancer can be prevented by avoiding multiple sex partners, using condoms to prevent the spread of human papillomavirus (which has been linked to cervical cancer), postponing first sexual intercourse until older, and not smoking cigarettes.Go to your local primary health care clinic.If a pap smear result is abnormal, a booking will be made and a referral letter given for further testing and treatment at a secondary or tertiary level hospital.Bring your ID book, referral letter (if relevant), any medication you are taking and your clinic/hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.A woman can get three free screening pap smears in her lifetime, one every 10 years starting at age 30.* Cervical Cancer Fact Sheet for Health Workers (Public Information)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Breast Cancer ScreeningIf a lump is detected, she will be referred for further investigation, which may include a mammogram, removal and testing of the lump to find out whether it is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), counselling, and treatment if necessary.Breast self-examination education is given at clinics.Bring your ID book, your clinic/hospital card if previously registered at facility and the referral letter from the clinic if you have been referred to a breast cancer clinic at a hospital.Services at primary health care facilities are free for people who are not on medical aid.If you are referred to a hospital, there may be a cost involved.* Breast Cancer Fact Sheet (Public Information)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Infertility ProgrammeDepending on the results, fertility treatment is either given or advised against.There is no service for infertility at primary health care level but the tertiary hospitals Tygerberg and Groote Schuur offer extensive investigations and treatment.A referral is necessary to a tertiary hospital where various fertility treatments are offered.If you are a first-time visitor you will have to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Take your ID book and hospital card if previously registered at the hospital.There is a cost involved.The amount will depend on the couple's income and number of dependents they have, according to the hospital rating scale.Those taking part in the programme have to pay for the treatment which can cost anything from between R150 and R6,600.The hospital will require a recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).The content on this page was last updated on 16 January 2004Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Services > Health > Reproductive > Male Reproductive HealthReproductive health is the shared responsibility of a couple.Therefore, men play an important role and should take their fair share of responsibility for contraception and for using condoms to prevent both unwanted pregnancies and the spread of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including HIV/Aids.Men and women should consult with their partners regarding the choice of contraception and negotiate a mutually acceptable method, and who should be the primary user.For example, a vasectomy is a very minor procedure for a man to undergo.Male circumcisionWith widespread reports of young men dying as a result of unsafe circumcisions, young men can have free medical check-ups at primary health care clinics to ensure that they are in good health before going to traditional initiation schools.Safe, hygienic circumcisions can be done at primary health care facilities.The procedure can be performed on male infants shortly after birth at various health care facilities.You should go to your local primary health care clinic.First -time visitors to primary health care facilities/hospitals will have to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Bring ID book and clinic/hospital card if previously registered at the facility.The amount will depend on your earnings and number of dependents, according to the hospital rating scale.* Contraception (Family Planning) (Service)Home > Your Government > The Government

ProgrammeThe programme also tries to identify the infectious pool of people.* What is TB?* Diagnosing TB* TB Treatment* DOTS* TB and HIV* Useful contactsWHAT IS TB?TB is a bacterial disease, and is a serious problem in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape.TB is highly infectious but curable.One out of ten people develop the disease.If not treated, the infectious person can affect 20 other people or more in a year.TB spreads when infected people with pulmonary (lung) TB cough tiny droplets containing TB into the air, and others breathe them in.People who have TB of other parts of the body are not infectious.A persistent cough of two weeks or more is the main sign of TB, so the earlier the client goes to the clinic to get examined, the easier it is to cure.More severe signs are coughing up of blood, nightsweats, loss of weight, and shortness of breath.DIAGNOSING TBThe client is examined at a primary health care clinic and asked to give a sputum sample and another the next day.These samples are sent to a laboratory and the results are available in 48 hours.Only one of them needs to be positive to indicate TB infection.If the result is positive, the client will be counselled and advised on the benefits of being put on the TB control programme.If both sputum samples are positive, treatment is given immediately.An x-ray may also be taken, but the sputum tests confirm diagnosis.If the TB infection is severe, the client will be referred to a specialist TB clinic.TB TREATMENTTB can only be cured if the full course of treatment, which can be from six to eight months, is completed.People who stop treatment are likely to develop multi-drug resistance, making the TB more difficult to cure.These cases are treated at TB specialist clinics e.g. Brooklyn Chest Hospital.TB can be fatal if not treated.Treatment is in two phases:The intensive phase is when four different drugs in tablet form are given for five days a week, for two to three months.The second phase is the continuation phase, in which two drugs are given for five days a week, for four to five months.First-time TB clients must be treated for six months, while clients who have had TB before must take TB medicine for eight months.If there are side effects from the medication, the client must return to the clinic.Sputum tests are taken again after two months on treatment to check for progress, and at five or seven months to confirm whether the client is cured.Children with TB are given different medicines and treated for four months only.To try and prevent TB, babies should be immunised with the BCG vaccine, which is available free of charge at all primary health care clinics.TB meningitis is a serious illness in children and can be fatal.If suspected (symptoms include neck stiffness) the child must be taken to the clinic immediately.DOTSThe Department of Health has adopted the World Health Organisation's DOTS (directly observed treatment short course) method to ensure patients adhere to treatment.DOTS has been implemented in most clinics in the Western Cape.An important element of the strategy is the support and encouragement offered to TB clients for the entire six- to eight-month treatment period, where clients are directly observed taking their medication at the clinic.At community level, DOTS is undertaken by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using volunteers as "treatment supporters".TB NGOs recruit, train and supervise members of communities to function as treatment supporters for TB clients.Supporters refer TB clients to the clinic when necessary.The Cape Technikon offers training for people who want to be TB supporters.Phone 021 460 3197 for further information.TB Care Association, Santa Cape Town and Santa Western Cape are the three NGOs that deliver community-based treatment to TB patients in the province.The provincial government provides financial assistance and support to these NGOs.TB AND HIVThe HIV epidemic has led to an enormous increase in the number of TB cases.TB, an opportunistic infection, is responsible for a third of all deaths in HIV-infected people.People with HIV are far more susceptible to TB infection, and are less able to fight it off.The Department of Health is in the process of adopting an integrated TB and HIV/Aids strategy.Currently voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is offered to TB clients with the aim of reducing early death and illness.Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (drugs to treat pneumonia) is given for dually infected individuals.* TB Care Association: tel 021 692 3027* Santa Cape Town: tel 021 696 5128* Santa Western Cape: tel 021 715 8901 for further information about branches in the Western

Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Health > Secondary, Tertiary and Emergency Care > Tygerberg and Dental Hospitals > Services > Health > Oral & Dental > Dental/Oral HealthThe State provides dental and oral health services to the public that aim to promote oral health, prevent tooth decay and treat any problems.* What dental services are offered?* Gum disease* Oral thrush* Anaesthetics* Jaw fractures* Who can get subsidised dental services?* Promotion and preventionWHAT DENTAL SERVICES ARE OFFERED?At the most basic level of care (primary health care clinics) the dental/oral health service has three parts: promotion, prevention and treatment.In some areas of the province (e.g. Mossel Bay) the same basic service is available at the local hospital.Oral health professionals at clinic level promote oral health by educating people on how to keep their mouths, gums and teeth in good health and by showing people how to prevent tooth decay and other oral problems.The basic treatment services available are oral examinations, X-rays, scaling and polishing of teeth in order to remove plaque and prevent gum disease, fillings and emergency relief of pain and sepsis including dental extractions.Crowns and bridges are sometimes available but are low priorities.GUM DISEASEA patient can be treated for severe gum disease (periodontitis) at a clinic.However, if there is oral pathology - lesions or ulcers in the soft mouth tissue often caused by excessive smoking, drinking or due to HIV infection - and the patient is in danger of getting cancer, then they will be referred to a tertiary level hospital.ORAL THRUSHPeople who are HIV positive and those that have Aids often suffer from oral thrush.These are open sores or lesions in the mouth.Diflucan, a drug, which treats oral thrush, is available free of charge at primary health care clinics.ANAESTHETICSPatients can be given a local anaesthetic for dental and oral problems at primary health care clinics.If a general anaesthetic is needed, the dentist will book the patient in at a local hospital theatre and the dentist will perform the procedure at the hospital.The Hope Street Clinic in Cape Town is the only clinic where general anaesthetic is available.JAW FRACTURESFractures of the upper jaw (often as a result of domestic violence or car accidents) will be referred to the secondary or tertiary hospitals.Simple lower jaw fractures can be seen at the primary health care facilities.The more complicated cases will be referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals.WHO CAN GET SUBSIDISED DENTAL SERVICES?The provincial government subsidises a denture service for indigent adults, those receiving old age pensions and those who have been institutionalised.There is a fee involved to cover laboratory costs.People with orthodontic problems can be seen at primary health care facilities but will be referred to dental schools at the University of the Western Cape and Tygerberg Hospital.Children who need to have braces put onto their teeth or removed will need to be referred to these dental schools.In urban clinics the oral health team is made up of a dentist, a dental assistant and an oral hygienist.The situation is different in rural areas that are visited by a dental team with mobile equipment.The equipment can be set up as an emergency service, usually at schools.PROMOTION AND PREVENTIONThe promotion and prevention programme includes visits by health workers to some crèches and some primary schools.Oral and dental information and education is also given to pregnant women as part of the antenatal service.Primary school children are taught about the need to prevent the build up of plaque and how to remove it through correct brushing and flossing of teeth.Toothbrushes and toothpaste are provided.They are also given a mouth rinse containing fluoride as part of the Fluoride Supplementation Programme.Fluoride strengthens teeth and helps prevent tooth decay.The children are educated about nutrition and the need for healthy eating habits to prevent the build up of plaque and tooth decay.Cape Town is the only city that is fluoridating its water supplies according to the Regulations under the Health Act, 1977 (Act 63 of 1977).)The Minister of Health and the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry have jointly approved the regulations.The service is available at all primary health care clinics or centres.Patients with complicated problems will be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for you.A referral letter from the clinic is required when visiting a hospital.Dental Hospital (Department of Health, Provincial Government of the Western Cape)* Water Fluoridation (Public Information)*

health services for the elderly* Abuse of the elderly* Assistive devicesGENERAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLYAlthough the running of Old Age homes (OAH) for the Aged / elderly is a function of the provincial Department of Social Development, the Department of Health is indirectly / directly involved in the health needs of the aged.Elderly patients, including those with chronic illnesses, can access health care at all levels for medication, rehabilitation and other health needs.Patients may go on their own from OAHs, their houses or residencies to and from clinics or hospitals when necessary.Transport may be provided by some OAHs.In addition, the Department checks on the nutrition aspect of meals served at OAHs for the elderly.Home-based care is also available to the Aged and can be accessed via the community health centres in the Metro.This service will become available to the Aged in the rural areas after March 2004.ABUSE OF THE ELDERLYAbuse of elderly people is a serious problem and is dealt with jointly by the provincial Departments of Social Development and Health, and sometimes the Department of Community Safety.The new Aged Persons' Bill / Act deals with abuse of the Aged, and who should report the incidence.The causes of abuse are varied however it is more likely to occur if the older person is physically dependent, lacks sufficient income to be self-sufficient, cannot remember, or becomes indecisive and confused.Other possible factors include poverty, unemployment, inappropriate housing, marital difficulties, alcohol and drug abuse and poor communication with or by the older person.Of the five areas of abuse (physical, emotional, financial, neglect and sexual), physical is the most harmful, causing physical, emotional and psychological pain and distress.Health staff at all levels of care can inform family and friends about what to look out for if they suspect that there is abuse of the elderly, whether it happens in the older person's home, an OAH / old age institution or other places of board and lodging.Health staff will keep a register of all reported cases of abuse.Families and the public can report abuse to their nearest Welfare office.There is also a national helpline (0800 0030 81) to report abuse.By phoning the social welfare services in an emergency, an older person can be placed into a safe place at a few old age homes for a short time until accommodation can be arranged or the problem is sorted out.ASSISTIVE DEVICESHealth services offer assistive devices such as wheelchairs to the elderly to make them less dependent.They can also be encouraged to join support groups for the elderly.Elderly folk should be encouraged to stay in their own homes with support for as long as they can.Older persons should know their rights so that they are empowered to report circumstances that are not desirable.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.There were plans to make all assistive devices free of charge from July 1, 2003.* Assistive Devices (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Voluntary Testing and CounsellingThe decision to be tested is a voluntary one - no one can be forced to have an HIV test.The three main steps to be followed are pre-test counselling, testing and post-test counselling.* Pre-test counselling* Testing* Post-test counsellingPRE-TEST COUNSELLINGThe discussion is private and confidential and includes information about HIV/AIDS and the test itself.Proxy consent can also be given.This is when a person is legally entitled to give consent on behalf of another individual.For example, a parent or guardian of a child below the age of 14 may give consent for an HIV test for the child.However, children who are 14 years and older who have consented to a test must be given their test results.This information may not be given to their parents without their consent.TESTINGHIV testing for an employee in the workplace is prohibited unless justified by an order of the Labour Court, in accordance with the Employment Equity Act No 55 of 1998 Section 7(2).The HIV test is an accurate scientific test to show if a person has been infected with HIV and is usually done on a person's blood.Most testing sites use a Rapid Test, which means that the test results are available after about 20 minutes.POST-TEST COUNSELLINGThe rapid test results are given during the post-test counselling session.This session is also confidential and it is against the law for any health care worker/counsellor to give a test result whether it is positive or negative to any other person without the permission of the individual who has had the test.If the test result is HIV-negative, the individual will be counselled on the dangers of risky sexual behaviour and educated about safer sex practices such as using condoms.If the individual is HIV-positive they will be counselled on how to deal with the news, and will be given information about safer sex practices and nutrition.Lay counsellors in the province are trained by the Aids Training and Information Centre (ATICC) based in Plumstead, Cape Town.Only volunteers working with NGOs in the field of HIV/Aids can apply for training.If you have any questions about HIV/Aids you can phone the free 24-hour Aids Helpline at 0800 012 322.These are some more useful contacts:* Aids Training, Information and Counselling Centre (ATICC): tel 021 763 5320/1/2/3, fax 797 3356*

Counselling and Testing (VCT) (Public Information) (File type: pdf; size: 280 KB)Home > Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Anti-Retroviral TherapyAntiretrovirals are medicines used to treat people with HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) infection.* What is HIV infection?* Prevention and awareness* Stages of HIV infection* What is antiretroviral therapy?* Who should take antiretroviral therapy?* Antiretroviral therapy in childrenWHAT IS HIV INFECTION?HIV or the human immunodeficiency virus, causes HIV infection.Once a person becomes infected with this virus he/she is infected for life.In the long term HIV causes AIDS (The Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).AIDS may only develop after many years of being infected with HIV.The HIV is passed from person to person in body fluids.The most likely way to catch the virus is through being exposed to an infected person's sexual fluids during sex.One in every six to eight people in South Africa is HIV positive.You do not need to have many sexual partners, nor do you need to have sex often to catch HIV.HIV may also be passed by blood or from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding.It is NOT passed by kissing, sharing plates or forks, or using the same toilet.PREVENTION AND AWARENESSPrevention and awareness remains the cornerstone of the Department of Health's approach to dealing with HIV/Aids.This is based on the ABCs - Abstain, Be mutually faithful, and Consistently Use Condoms:* Abstain from Sex - This is the only guaranteed protection from HIV infection.* Be mutually faithful - Always have sex with the same person.This person also must not have sex with anyone else and not have been infected with HIV or other Sexually Transmitted Infections.* Consistently Use Condoms - Use them every time you have sexual intercourse and use them correctly.THE IMMUNE SYSTEM:Your body has an immune system that defends your body and keeps you well.HIV attacks and kills the "soldiers" in the immune system (called CD4 cells).Without these CD4 cells your body is unable to defend itself from germs.It takes the HIV many years (between 3 and 20) to damage all the CD4 cells so it is a long while before there are too few to defend your body.There are many years after infection when a person can remain well.STAGES OF HIV INFECTIONStage 1: During this time the "soldiers" are still relatively strong.A person with stage 1 HIV usually looks and feels well.Glands causing swellings in the neck or groin are common- these show that the immune system is fighting the HIV.Stage 2: As the CD4 count becomes lower minor illnesses may develop, such as skin rashes or diarrhoea.People with Stage 2 infection may lose some weight.Stage 3: Tuberculosis is a common stage 3 illness in the Western Cape.People with stage 3 illness may see thrush in their mouths.More weight loss or diarrhoea may occur in stage 3.Other infections, like pneumonia, may occur.Stage 4: An HIV infected person with Stage 4 illness is at risk of developing opportunistic infections.These are infections, which only happen in people with very weak immune systems (CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3).Once one of these illnesses occurs, the person is said to have AIDS.Many of the illnesses that HIV infected people develop are treatable, particularly when diagnosed early.Some others can be prevented.It is very important that HIV infected people go to see their nurse or doctor if they become unwell, to get problems treated as soon as possible.WHAT IS ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY?Antiretrovirals are medicines given to people with HIV to suppress the virus in their blood.THEY ARE NOT A CURE FOR HIV/AIDS.They lower the level of the virus in the blood.This allows the immune system to recover (the CD4 count may increase).People taking antiretrovirals may find that their appetite improves, they pick up weight and problems they had, such as diarrhoea or skin rashes, clear up.If antiretrovirals are taken reliably and correctly, the medicines can reduce the virus to a level in the blood when it can no longer be measured (undetectable).WHO SHOULD TAKE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY?People who are infected with HIV do not need antiretroviral treatment while their immune system is still strong (Stages 1, 2 and 3).Antiretroviral treatment is only needed once the immune system has become weak.Antiretroviral treatment should be considered if an HIV infected adult has a CD4 count People who are infected with HIV do not need antiretroviral treatment while their immune system is still strong (Stages 1, 2 and 3).People considering antiretroviral therapy must be prepared to take tablets every day, twice a day.People with substance abuse problems, eg drinking alcohol excessively, find it very difficult to take medicines reliably every day.COMPREHENSIVE HIV CAREAntiretroviral medicines (ARVs) form part of the care of HIV infected people.HIV positive people can live healthily for many years before they reach the point where they require treatment with ARVs.It is very important that people living with HIV attend their primary health care facility for regular follow up.People living with HIV should go to their primary health care facility promptly if they become unwell.If an HIV-infected person notices any of the following problems, it is important that they visit their primary health care facility for a check-up:* Ongoing cough (>2 weeks)* Marked loss of weight (a few kilograms)* Ongoing night sweating (> 2 weeks)* Loose stools or diarrhoea for more than 2 weeks* Severe headaches or depression* Any other symptoms that worry themGETTING ACCESS TO ARVSAntiretroviral therapy is available at designated sites throughout the province.HIV infected people who require antiretroviral therapy may access antiretroviral treatment by referral from their primary care facility.All primary care facilities in the province can refer clients for antiretroviral therapy at antiretroviral sites.Also hospitals will ask for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).The following organisations may provide assistance:* Aids Training, Information and Counselling Centre (ATICC): tel 021 797 3327; fax 797 3356Secondary, Tertiary and Emergency

Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Treatment of Opportunistic InfectionsTreatment of Opportunistic InfectionsTreatment is available for opportunistic infections that, unlike HIV, are mostly curable.These include diarrhoea, tuberculosis, pneumonia and candida (oral or vaginal thrush), which an HIV-positive person can pick up easily because their immune system is weakened by HIV.Treatment for opportunistic infections is available for people who are both HIV-positive and HIV-negative.Anyone who has symptoms of these opportunistic infections can go to a clinic were they will be treated with antibiotics that have been shown to reduce the number of opportunistic infections in Aids by 50%.The province is also part of the Diflucan Partnership Programme, which makes the drug Diflucan available at 62 facilities, 39 of which are primary health clinics.You can get treatment at all primary health care facilities.There are also 20 dedicated Aids clinics in the province to which you could be referred.* You can Help your Child with Diarrhoea (Public Information) (File type: pdf; size: 263 KB)Home > Directories > Services > Health > HIV/Aids > Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT)Mother to child transmission happens when HIV, the virus that causes Aids, is passed from a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy, during birth or during breastfeeding.The PMTCT progamme aims to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from the mother to her baby.* What is the PMTCT programme?* Infant feeding* The baby's health and development* The mother's health and development* Getting NevirapineWHAT IS THE PMTCT PROGRAMME?When a mother goes to the clinic, Midwife Obstetric Unit or hospital for her first antenatal visit, she is given counselling and is asked if she wants to take an HIV test.The results are confidential, which means that only the counsellor and healthcare workers looking after the mother will discuss the results.If the mother takes the test and is found to be HIV positive, she will have the option to join the PMTCT programme free of charge.As part of the programme she will be given Nevirapine and Zidovudine, anti-HIV medicine.The mother must take the Zidovudine from 34 weeks pregnancy, and will be given Nevirapine when she goes into labour and reports at the hospital or MOU.These medicines in syrup form, will also be given to the baby within 6-72 hours of birth.It's important to note that:* The medication only reduces the chance of passing the virus in the mother's body to the baby during delivery.Transmission during delivery is the most common factor, accounting for 60-85% of transmissions of the virus from the mother to her baby.* Babies who get the virus while the mother is pregnant or as a result of breastfeeding will not be protected by the antiretroviral medicine.* The medication is only used to try and protect the baby.It is not going to cure the mother of HIV.Any mother who wishes to know her HIV status may access HIV testing and treatment through the PMTCT program at any antenatal facility throughout the Western Cape.INFANT FEEDINGCounselling and advice on infant feeding for HIV-positive mothers is available.Mothers are given a choice to either exclusively breastfeed for four to six months or exclusively formula feed.Exclusive breastfeeding means that the baby must only be given breast milk, no tea, no water and no juice.This reduces the chance of the virus in the breast milk being passed on to the baby.Those mothers choosing to formula feed will get free milk powder for six months.They will get two tins of milk powder on discharge after delivery and will also get eight tins per month at the local baby clinic.THE BABY'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTThe mother must go regularly to the post-natal clinic to have the baby weighed, to get immunisations, to be given milk powder and to get Co-trimoxazole, medicine to prevent pneumonia.Babies are tested for the HIV at 14 weeks when they report for the 3rd immunisation visit.If negative, the baby does not need Co-trimoxazole any longer.If the baby tests positive then they must continue with Co-trimoxazole.If the baby is positive, it will need special care throughout its life.THE MOTHER'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTHIV can live for a long time (3-10) years in the body whilst the mother feels healthy and well.For this reason mothers are encouraged to go to the clinic regularly to get medicine for opportunistic infections to keep healthy for longer.She is encouraged to use condoms every time she has sex so that she can protect herself and her partner from contracting the virus, or from getting more of the virus if both partners are HIV positive.The mother will also be given counselling about contraception options for after the birth.The health worker will encourage the mother to tell the father of the baby that she is HIV positive so that he can also be tested.This can happen with the aid of the counsellor or health worker.It is important for the mother to join a group that will support her and give her information on eating nutritiously and how to look after herself and the baby.Formal support groups are available and can be contacted through the local clinic.Remember that the presence of maternal Sexually Transmitted

tendered for and subsidised by the provincial government.Patients who need ongoing care at home upon discharge from hospital are referred to a health facility at primary health care level in the area in which they live.The nursing sister at the clinic or primary health care centre refers the patient to the NPO partner responsible for HBC services in the area.The NPO co-coordinator (nursing sister) will assess the needs of the individual in their home and develop a care plan for them.The sister then assigns a caregiver to the individual.The caregiver will render the service according to the instruction on the care plan and the sister will visit the individual to make sure that the plan is being carried through.HBC is not a 24-hour service and does not replace the family as the primary caregiver.It is only meant to be a complementary and supportive service to prevent "burn-out" for caregivers who are forced to care for sick relatives.TRAINING FOR CAREGIVERSThey make themselves available as companions, fetch medication, and do shopping errands etc.Please note that this service has not been implemented in all areas.Contact the Regional HBC programme manager for

(Frequency of visits may differ from area to area).Pregnant mothers are screened for possible risks to their health and the health of the foetus.Both teenage girls and women over 35 years old who are pregnant are regarded as high-risk cases.This means they are more likely to have complications during pregnancy and birth.Pregnant women may also be seen to be high risk if they have raised blood pressure, a history of genetic disorders, a multiple pregnancy and if they have had previous surgery such as a caesarean section.Mothers who are diagnosed as high risk are referred up the line to out-patient antenatal clinics at the secondary or tertiary level hospitals, where further investigations and screening tests are carried out.Mothers with high-risk pregnancies are advised to attend outpatient antenatal clinics as often as necessary.Bring your ID book, any medication you are taking and a clinic or hospital card, if previously registered at the facility.Low-risk pregnancies are managed at MOUs (birthing units run by midwives in the community for primary health care patients) in urban areas, and satellite and fixed clinics in the rural areas.High-risk pregnancies are managed at out -patient clinics at urban and rural regional hospitals and tertiary hospitals.Services are free of charge.* Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention and Treatment (Service)* Results of the 2001 Annual HIV Antenatal Survey (Public Information) (File type: pdf;

problem in South Africa and is one of the biggest contributors to childhood illness and death.It is estimated that about 30% of South African children are stunted from a lack of adequate nutrition in the early years of their lives.Inadequate food intake, illness and psychosocial stress/trauma are the most significant immediate causes of malnutrition.Poverty and lack of resources are basic factors that contribute to malnutrition.The INP tries to deal with this silent epidemic in a number of ways.SUPPLEMENTS FOR CHILDRENAt primary health care level children who are examined and identified as undernourished (this includes children and adults who are HIV positive and with tuberculosis) will be given food supplements including fortified maize meal and a high-energy drink.Supplements are given to identified clients according to criteria.Health workers also provide counselling, information and education about healthy diets and the healthiest ways of preparing food.Dieticians also provide specialised services to the community.BREASTFEEDINGTo help fight malnourishment in early childhood health workers encourage women to breastfeed their children exclusively until six months of age and thereafter to continue breastfeeding in addition to the introduction of appropriate complementary foods, until the child is two years old.Other feeding options are discussed with mothers who are HIV positive.Vredendal Hospital and Groote Schuur Maternity Centre are Baby Friendly Hospitals in the province according to the Baby friendly Hospital Initiative.GROWTH MONITORINGAll children are weighed regularly as part of the growth monitoring programme, a sensitive indicator of whether the child is growing.The weight is entered onto the Road to Health Card.Underlying causes for weight loss are looked into such as infectious diseases, shortage of food at home and child neglect.Infectious diseases play a great part in undernourishment and these illnesses are treated at primary health care level.Diarrhoeal disease is closely related to poor environmental hygiene (sanitation and water supply) and under- or poor nutrition of an infant, which in turn makes him/her more vulnerable to serious and prolonged diarrhoea.POVERTY ALLEVIATIONPoverty stricken households are identified and referred to one of the government's poverty alleviation programmes.Household food security is addressed intersectorally and appropriate interventions and support are provided.VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTSControlling micronutrient deficiencies is an essential part of the service.Micronutrients are natural substances such as vitamins and minerals, which are found in small amounts in food and are very important in maintaining good health.The INP provides Vitamin A supplementation to targeted children.Children who lack Vitamin A lose weight, fail to grow properly and are more likely to get infections and to die from them.A lack of Vitamin A also damages the eye and is one of the main causes of blindness amongst children.Children with low birth weights are given Vitamin A capsules, which boost the immune system and help with the child's developmental growth.Infants from 6 -11months are given a single dose of Vitamin A (100 000 IU) to prevent severe illness.Children from 12 months to five years old are given a single dose of 200 000 IU at 12 months then a dose of 200 000 IU every six months until five years of age.Additional doses of Vitamin A are given to children who are severely malnourished, or who have persistent infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles or HIV infection.DE-WORMINGWeight loss in children can also be due to worm infestation and this can be treated at the clinic with de-worming medication.NUTRITIONAL ADVICE FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONSNutritional education, information and counselling is given at all levels of care to people who have had strokes, who have hypertension, high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis.PRIMARY SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMMEThe Primary School Nutrition Programme is available at specifically identified sub-economic schools.These schemes are currently run jointly with the Department of Education.The provincial government aims to reach 125, 000 children at 847 primary schools in the province by 2004 with its school-feeding programme.FOOD IN INSTITUTIONSThe INP also contributes to the institutional care of clients through food service systems for the provision of balanced nutrition.First time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.* Integrated Nutrition Programme - A Foundation for Life (Public Information)*

Directories > Services > Health > Occupational Health > Occupational Health ServicesHowever, there are workplaces that are unsafe and that affect the health of the workers.Occupational health professionals (doctors/nurses) at all health facilities are trained to identify, diagnose, treat and rehabilitate employees who have chronic diseases and injuries as a result of being injured in the workplace or being exposed to hazardous substances at work.Inspectors from the Inspection and Enforcement Services of the National Department of Labour (see labour services) routinely visit factories and other workplaces.They make sure the workplace conforms to the health and safety standards as set down by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993, which is administered by the Department of Labour.The inspectors advise managers and owners on how to improve working conditions where necessary, and may enforce the labour law by serving contravention notices, suspension of services and prosecutions.Environmental health practitioners who work in terms of the Health Act 63 of 1977 only check some workplaces such as restaurants, airports and sea ports, to ensure they comply with health regulations.Here are some questions you can ask yourself if you suspect that your health is being affected by your place of work:* Has the work I do caused my health problems?* Does the work I do aggravate the illness or injury?* Am I experiencing symptoms within a certain time of finishing work?* Do any of my co-workers experience similar symptoms?* Will what I am doing now, affect my health in 10 or 15 years' time?* Is my work environment safe?Remember that if you are injured or ill as a result of the work you do, you can claim compensation.Compensation is administered by the Department of Labour and not the Department of Health.You can be compensated for all reasonable medical costs.Primary health care staff may refer you to a secondary or tertiary hospital depending on the complexity of the illness or injury.The Reed Street Clinic in Bellville, Cape Town, is dedicated specifically to people with occupational health problems.It is open one day a week and you have to make an appointment.It is essential that you tell the nursing sister what you have been exposed to in current and previous workplaces.These could include: noise, dust, asbestos, gas, fumes and vibrating machinery, as well as abnormal stress.Reed Street Clinic has links with provincial primary health care clinics, private doctors and employers, trade unions, the Department of Labour, environmental health practitioners and Tygerberg and Groote Schuur Hospitals.Depending on the complexity of the illness or injury you may be referred to Groote Schuur Hospital's Work Health Occupational Diseases Clinic.Employees may also be referred to the Groote Schuur's Work Rehabilitation and Assessment Centre where they will be assessed and rehabilitated to the point where they will be able to return to work.The employer and the health professional that attend to you have to complete forms according to the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act 130 of 1993.If you are a first-time visitor to the health facility you will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Bring your ID book, a referral letter (if required), and any medication you are taking.If you are referred to a hospital you will be asked for your most recent payslip/income assessment (IRP5).Bring your hospital card, if previously registered at the hospital.* Provincial Environmental and Occupational Health: Roles and Functions (Public Information) (File type: pdf; size: 35 KB)Home > Directories > Services > Health > Port & Environmental > Port HealthThese infectious diseases include yellow fever, cholera, plague and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).Port and Environmental Health is responsible for the three sea ports (Cape Town, Mossel Bay and Saldanha Bay) and the two airports (Cape Town International and George, which has temporary international status).On arrival, a metro (emergency services) doctor will assess the person and the necessary measures will be taken (e.g. quarantine).Water and food supplies to aircraft are monitored.VESSEL INSPECTIONVessels that seek entry to any of the three sea ports must submit a Maritime Declaration of Health.Vessels are checked for rodents and a valid De-ratting Exemption Certificate is required.According to international health regulations, an infected vessel must be fumigated.Water and food supplies to vessels are monitored.IMPORTED FOODSTUFFSImported foodstuffs are inspected at random for possible hazardous or toxic substances at all entry ports.When goods are offloaded, they are usually removed under extended health guarantees and only released if the port authority is satisfied.All shipments must conform to the Foodstuff, Cosmetic and Disinfectants Act, 54 of 1972.PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICINESProducts are checked to see whether they have been registered with the Medicines Control Council of South Africa, or whether they have expired.Hazardous substances such as chemicals, pesticides and fungicides are also detainedPORT EXPORTSThe port health authority will issue health certificates for export under certain conditions.For more information regarding port health phone Mr M Slabber on tel 021 4211124, fax 021 418 5685.The postal address is P.O.Box 6489, Roggebaai, 8012 and the street address is Room 906, 9th Floor, Customs

ServicesPhysically and/or mentally disabled adults and children can be helped to reach and maintain their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric and social functional levels.The service is essential but is not extensive and fails to reach many people in need due to a lack of resources.Most public sector services are based in hospitals and special schools, with few services available at community level.* Primary Level and Step Down Rehabilitation Services* Secondary Level Rehabilitation Services* Tertiary Level Rehabilitation Services* Specialist and Academic RehabilitationPrimary Level Rehabilitation Services are limited to certain community health centres and district hospitals.For more information about available services phone the regional rehabilitation managers at the following numbers:* Metropole: S Misbach 021 918 1286 or 021 918 1508* South Cape/Karoo: Lian Drotsky 044 874 2172* Boland/Overberg: 023 348 1405* West Coast Winelands: Bronwynn Weilbach 022 487 9268However, all clinics do routine developmental screening for babies and toddlers.When there is a suspected mental or physical disability the child will be referred to a specialist clinic at secondary or tertiary level.At the same time the child will be referred to a rehabilitation professional e.g. physiotherapist or occupational therapist at primary health care level where available.In addition to initial screening with subsequent referral, rehabilitation at this level is primarily focused on the management of acute conditions, home based visits, the training of family and care givers, screening for disability grants and consultation with NGOs, support groups, schools and creches.Booth Hospital in Cape Town and Life Care in Pinelands make provision for low intensity rehabilitation and step down care while services for children are available at Sarah Fox and Maitland Cottage, also in Cape Town.Clients will be referred to secondary or tertiary level care if necessary.Tertiary Level Rehabilitation Services are provided by Tygerberg, Groote Schuur and Red Cross Children's Hospitals and the psychiatric hospitals (Stikland, Lentegeur, Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital), all in Cape Town.Occupational therapy departments at Tygerberg, Groote Schuur, Stikland and Lentegeur Hospitals provide some vocational rehabilitation.This involves mostly work assessment, which tests the readiness of clients to re-enter the open labour market after injury or illness.If they are not ready, staff recommend they be placed in a protective workshop (sheltered employment), which falls under the provincial Department of Social Development and the National Department of Labour.This service provides a high-intensity rehabilitation service for physically disabled adults.There is an outpatient clinic for one stop assessment and management of the client's rehabilitation needs.Multidisciplinary teams provide outreach assessment and training at clinics and in the community and helps clients to get the most appropriate assistive device (wheelchair or buggy) for their needs.The team also helps rehabilitation staff in other areas to gain in-service training experience.People who are physically and mentally disabled must first check if there is a service at primary health care level.They will be referred up the line when necessary.First-time visitors to the clinic or secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Free at primary health care level.Following Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang's announcement that a free health care policy for people with disabilities would come into operation on 1 July 2003, this service should be free.This covers outpatient visits and admissions to hospitals, and includes disability aids such as wheelchairs and hearing aids.The free service should include people who have permanent disabilities that have resulted in moderate to severe difficulty in living a normal life, older people who are considered frail, and long-term patients in institutions for mental health care.The criteria for assessments and exactly how this will be implemented are currently being investigated.Home > Directories > Services > Health > Rehabilitation > Assistive DevicesAssistive DevicesThe service aims to supply, prescribe, maintain and recycle assistive devices such as wheel chairs and walkers and hearing aids to people who need them.There are various centres in the regions where assistive devices can be prescribed, maintained and repaired:* Metropole - Western Cape Rehabilitation Centre at the Conradie Hospital and Karl Bremer Sites in Cape Town* Boland /Overberg - Bravelskloof Rehabilitation Centre* There are six sites in the Westcoast/ Winelands region, which are based at the following hospitals: Stellenbosch, Paarl, Citrusdaal, Clanwilliam, Vredendal and Vredenberg.* The South Cape/Karoo has five sites: George, Oudtshoorn, Beaufort West, Plettenberg Bay and Mossel Bay.In general, assistive devices are in short supply throughout the Western Cape.Services are frequently reliant on donations for second-hand items and the purchase of new equipment.To get a wheelchair, or in the case of children a buggy (pushcart), you should go to the nearest primary health care centre which offers this service.Bring your ID book, or in the case of a child, the Road to Health Card.If you need an assistive device, you must ask for the orthopaedic aftercare sister or physiotherapist/occupational therapist at the nearest clinic or community health centre/district hospital.A wheelchair will cost about R395, which can be used for life.The buggy costs R25 and must be returned to the state if it is no longer needed.The buggy will be re-sold but at a lower cost.All assistive devices can be paid off in monthly instalments.Following Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang's announcement that a free health care policy for people with disabilities would come into operation on July 1, 2003, this service should be free.Home > Directories > Services > Health > Rehabilitation > Prosthetic and Orthotic ServicesThe whole of the Western Cape is served by a single Orthotic and Prosthetic Centre in Pinelands, Cape Town.Orthotic devices are used to optimise functional mobility in a disabled person e.g. shoe inserts, and ankle-foot orthoses, which stabilise the ankle after a stroke.Prosthetic devices, on the other hand, replace a body part after the loss of a limb either by birth or due to an accident.The centre is responsible for providing orthotic and prosthetic services to all the four Western Cape regions excluding the South/Cape Karoo, which has outsourced this service to a private service provider.You have to be referred to the Pinelands centre by either an orthopaedic surgeon/orthopaedic sister/physiotherapist or occupational therapist.Staff from the centre offer outreach programmes at satellite clinics in the various regions once every three months.Callipers are available for people who have polio, neurological disorders, strokes and low muscle tone.People who are physically and mentally disabled must first check to see if there is a service at primary health care level.They will be referred up the line when necessary.First-time visitors to the clinic/secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Bring your ID book and in the case of a child,

get the service?WHO CAN GET A TERMINATION?Any women (irrespective of age) can get a legal abortion for an unwanted pregnancy according to the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy Act no 92 of 1996.Pre- and post- TOP counselling that is not prescriptive should be provided.Parental or partner's consent is not required.Women are advised to go for safe, legal abortions rather than "backstreet" abortions that are likely to endanger their health and their lives.Also see Contraception (Family Planning) for emergency contraception.WHERE CAN YOU GET THE SERVICE?To get a free abortion, the request for a TOP must be made at a primary health care clinic, where the pregnancy will be confirmed, counselling provided, an appointment made, and a referral letter be given to a facility where the procedure can be performed.Not all health workers are willing to be involved in this service, but they are obligated by law to inform the client of her rights and must refer the client to a health worker or facility where she can get the service.The service can also be accessed via a General Practitioner (GP) but a consultation fee will be required.Marie Stopes Clinics and private hospitals also provide the service for a fee.Any girl or women can ask for a TOP in the first three months (12 weeks) of pregnancy.It is important to act quickly if an unwanted pregnancy is suspected.If you are three to five months (13-20 weeks) pregnant, a different set of rules apply for TOP.The doctor, in this case, will carry out the TOP only if:* There is a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or foetus* Having the baby will cause major social or economic problems for the mother.* The woman is pregnant from rape or incest.The service, however, must still be requested at a Primary Health Care Clinic.The following private organisations can also be of assistance:* Reproductive Rights Alliance (RRA): tel 011 403 2101, email rradmin@sn.apc.org or rracoord@sn.apc.org.* Planned Parenthood Association (PPA) Western Cape: tel 021 448 7312, email ppawc@ppawc.co.zaHOW CAN YOU GET THE SERVICE?If you are a first-time visitor to a health facility you will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened.Bring your ID book, your referral letter (if relevant), any medication you are taking and your clinic/hospital card, if you have previously registered at the facility.You must sign an informed consent form giving permission for the TOP to be done.Health workers who are unwilling to give the service for any reason must refer you to a colleague who is willing to do so or to the appropriate regional facility with a referral letter and a booking.TOP is free of charge at primary health care facilities and when referred up the line.Ambulance services are free of charge for women who have an abortion.The content on this page was last updated on 14 September 2004* National Guideline for Cervical Cancer Screening

gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, chlamydial infection and syphilis.Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and some subtypes of HPV are responsible for most cases of cervical cancer.Most STDs can be treated and cured.However, Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) and the sexually transmitted virus - Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV) - that causes Aids cannot be cured.HIV can be transmitted by sexual contact, by blood and from a pregnant woman to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.Although HIV cannot be cured, its effects can sometimes be stopped for some time.It's important to remember that other STDs such as syphilis and vaginal thrush increase a person's chances of getting HIV or spreading it to others.This is a good reason for people with STDs to get treatment immediately and if possible, to be tested for HIV and counselled.This can be done at all primary health care clinics and centres.The HIV/Aids Directorate has started a pilot STD programme with a few General Practitioners in the province.The programme makes counselling, diagnosis and treatment of STDs available in an alternative setting to a primary health care facility.The GP will give a clinical examination and treatment for STDs if necessary.The client will have to pay a consultation fee but the medication will be given free of charge.Find out from your local primary health care facility where you can contact one of the GPs.All primary health care clinics or centres can test and treat STDs.If necessary, people may need to be referred to secondary or tertiary level hospitals for further testing and treatment.First-time visitors to the clinic, secondary or tertiary hospital will be asked to fill out a form and a folder will be opened for the patient.Bring your hospital card if you've previously registered at the hospital.Home > Directories > Services > Health > Tuberculosis > TB Control Programme* City of Cape Town / Metropole

Organization says immunisation saves three million lives a year.* What is immunisation?* What diseases do children get vaccinated against?* When must children be vaccinated?WHAT IS IMMUNISATION?The Department of Health strongly advises mothers to protect their children from infectious diseases by getting them vaccinated from birth to when they are five years old.Vaccination is free of charge at all health facilities.The Department also runs immunisation campaigns and health workers are sent to primary schools to immunise the children.Immunisations are safe.WHAT DISEASES DO CHILDREN GET VACCINATED AGAINST?Polio is caused by germs (polioviruses), which attack nerves, causing weakness or paralysis of the leg and/or arm and if severe, may involve respiratory or breathing muscles.Measles causes high fever and a rash and can lead to diarrhoea and dehydration, deafness, eye complications, pneumonia, brain damage and even death.Haemophilus Influenza Type B (Hib) is a serious illness that affects mainly children under the age of 5 years, and death from Hib disease is common in children under the age of one.Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver, which can cause liver damage, liver cancer and death.Pertussis (whooping cough) starts with a headache, fever and cough.The strenuous coughing bouts make it hard for a child to eat, drink or even breathe.The germ can cause muscle spasms, breathing and heart problems, and death.The chances of dying from this condition are very high.Diphtheria is a dangerous bacterial disease, which makes it difficult to breathe.Tuberculosis (TB) Meningitis is a serious disease that can affect people of all ages.Those that get TB suffer from coughing for a long period of time, chest pain, sweating at night, weight loss and even death if left untreated.In young children the TB germ may infect the brain and cause meningitis, or it could also enter the blood and spread to other parts of the body.TB can kill young people.The best protection for young children for diseases caused by the TB germ is the BCG vaccine.Usually babies who were not given the BCG vaccine at birth will be immunised when they are taken to the clinic for the next immunisation visit, at six weeks of age.Any baby under one year who did not get the BCG vaccine at birth must be taken to the nearest clinic, where the vaccine will be given.Babies infected with HIV, who are sick and showing sign of Aids must NOT get the BCG vaccine.The immunisation schedule below shows the ages for each immunisation.It is important to complete the full course of immunisations as described in the table.AgeVaccineHow?At birthBCG (vaccine against TB)Polio vaccineVaccination upper right armDrops by mouth6 weeks

Rights?AUTHOR: Cape GatewayEventually, everyone needs to stop working.Some people prefer to retire at an early age while others choose to work for as long as possible.Whatever your preference, you need to know what your rights and options are.RETIREMENT AGEThe labour legislation does not deal directly with the issue of retirement age.However, it does say that no one may be unfairly discriminated against because of their age.This means that the employer and employee must agree on a retirement age.There are three possible situations that you could find yourself in:* Your employment contract requires you to retire at a certain age.* You have agreed with you employer on a retirement age or there is a company norm.* There is no mention of retirement in your contract and there is no agreement.If you sign an employment contract that stipulates a retirement age, then you can legally be required to retire at that age.The organisation won't be required to give you notice.If the retirement age is not in the contract but is agreed or if there is an organisational norm, then the employer can give you notice requiring you to retire at that age.The notice period will be the same as the notice period for termination of employment set out in your contract of employment.When would there be deemed to be an organisational norm?There is a general understanding that the "normal" retirement age is 55, 60 or 65 but this understanding is too vague to be useful in specific instances.Indications of the organisation's norm can be found in:* the rules of a company's provident or pension fund (but this is not definitive)* company policy.If there is no mention of a retirement age in your contract and there is no organisational norm, then you can continue to work until you are unable to do your job properly.Your employer can only terminate your contract in accordance with the labour legislation (that is for misconduct, operational requirements or incompetence) and will have to follow the procedures set out in your contract and labour law.The courts have found that it is unfair discrimination for your employer to terminate your employment services just because of your age.For more information on the law around dismissals, see the Department of Labour's guide to the Labour Relations Act called "Know Your LRA".WHAT IF YOU CONTINUE TO WORK AFTER THE RETIREMENT AGE?There is no legal certainty regarding the rights of an employee who works beyond retirement age.It is thus advisable for the employer and employee to clearly define the terms of employment after the retirement age, for example how long the employee will continue to work for and what notice is required to terminate the employment.WHERE CAN YOU GET AN INCOME FROM AFTER RETIREMENT?After you retire you will usually rely on a pension or provident fund for your income.You can either draw a state pension or you can contribute to a private pension fund or provident fund.For detailed information on how private provident funds and pension funds work visit the Black Sash and ETU paralegal advice website.The content on this page was last updated

Education and Training > Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) and the Skills LevySector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) and the Skills LevyThe Skills Development approach aims to provide a framework for developing and implementing sector and workplace strategies to improve workers' skills.Part of the strategy is the Skills Development Levy, which is an amount of money that employers have to pay to SARS for skills development of their employees.The National Skills Fund funds skills-development projects that don't fall under the SETAs.An employer can get back 50% or more of the levies they paid to SARS from the SETA or the National Skills Fund to use on training and developing their own employees' skills.The National Skills Authority reviews and monitors the implementation of the National Skills Development Strategy* Who needs to pay the levy?* How much do you need to pay?* How do you pay?* How do you get a Skills Development Grant?WHO NEEDS TO PAY THE LEVY?As an employer, you must pay the skills development levy every month if:* You have registered your employees with SARS for tax purposes (PAYE), and/or* You pay over R250 000 a year in salaries and wages to your employees (even if they are not registered for PAYE with SARS).HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO PAY?You need to pay 1% of the total amount paid in salaries to employees (including overtime payments, leave pay, bonuses, commissions and lump sum payments).HOW DO YOU PAY?To pay you must register with SARS and pay the levy each month.SARS will supply the correct forms to fill in (SDL 201 return form).The levy must be paid to SARS not later than seven days after the end of every month.HOW DO YOU GET A SKILLS DEVELOPMENT GRANT?You can get money back from the SETA or the National Skills Fund to use on training and developing your employees' skills.To qualify for a Skills Development Grant you must:* Have paid Skills Development levies.* Have a Skills Development Facilitator.* Follow all the rules and regulations in the Act.For more information contact the National Skills Authority at the Department of Labour:Private Bag X9090, Cape Town, 8001Room 1207,

Publications > Public Information > Y &gt What is Asthma?4 May 2004AUTHOR: Professor Prakash Jeena, Dr David Luyt and Dr Adrian Morris (Revised by: Dr Robin Green - 2004)* What is Asthma?* What are the Symptoms of Asthma?* How can Asthma Affect my Life or the Quality of my Life?* What starts an Asthma Attack?* How is Asthma Treated?* Where Can I Get More Information on Asthma?* Asthma in South AfricaWHAT IS ASTHMA?* Asthma is one of the most common respiratory complaints in the world today.* It affects approximately one in ten children (10%) and one in twenty adults (5%).* It can occur for the first time at any age, even in adulthood.* Although asthma usually begins before the age of five years, a few children affected will 'outgrow" it during their teenage years but it usually persists if contracted in adulthood.* Asthma tends to run in families as do related allergic conditions like hay fever and eczema.* It cannot as yet be cured but if kept under control those affected will be able to lead normal lives enjoying full involvement in sport and all other activities.WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA?Cough, wheeze, tight chest, shortness of breath.These symptoms are often worse at night and after activity/exercise.HOW CAN ASTHMA AFFECT MY LIFE/ QUALITY OF LIFE?* Nighttime symptoms disturb sleep.Exercise becomes impaired.* Work or school days are missed (having a family member or child with asthma also leads to days off work to care for them).* Acute attacks and symptoms are troublesome, potentially dangerous and costly.WHAT STARTS AN ASTHMA ATTACK?The greatest tragedy of asthma is that it is sometimes not recognised and treated, in which case the patient undergoes needless suffering.The exact cause of the asthmatic process is not well understood but it is thought to be triggered off by an allergy or when the lungs are irritated by something in the air.A viral coldA viral cold or the flu can make asthma symptoms temporarily worse and this effect may last for up to six weeks after the illness.AllergiesAsthma attacks are most commonly triggered by allergies to airborne particles of house-dust mites, grass or tree pollens, fungal spores and skin flakes from furry animals such as cats and dogs.Certain foods and additives can (rarely) also trigger off asthma when eaten.PollutionPollution in the environment, especially cigarette smoke, car exhaust fumes and certain chemical gases can aggravate an asthma attack.Even children will be affected if they passively breathe their parents' cigarette smoke into their lungs.Sport and exerciseSport and exercise, particularly in cold weather, can set off an asthma attack.However with the correct treatment asthma can be well controlled so asthmatics should not avoid sport or exercise.fact about 10% of Olympic athletes have asthma.EmotionsEmotions such as excitement, anger, fear and laughter can all aggravate asthma.DrugsCertain commonly used medicines such as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory tablets may trigger asthma.Environmental factorsOccupational hazardsProlonged exposure to many substances is regarded to be harmful to the lungs, and by law such occupation-induced asthma is compensatable. hese include: organic dusts (wood,grain, grain flour, tobacco), isocyanates, formaldehyde, vapour, fumes (amines), metals (platinum, nickel, cobalt, vanadium), soldering and weldingHOW IS ASTHMA TREATED?Asthma cannot be completely cured no matter what anyone says, but with the right treatment most asthmatics will lead completely normal lives.WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION ON ASTHMA?Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.Alternatively, visit the Allergy Society of South Africa (ALLSA) website or the National Asthma Education Programme (NAEP) website.ASTHMA IN SOUTH AFRICAPrevalenceThere is undoubted evidence of a significant increase in the number of people who have asthma amongst all races in South Africa.Over the past 25 years a 25 to 200 times rise in hospital admissions for asthma has been recorded in hospitals in Durban and Soweto.For decades, allergic diseases have been recognised to be infrequent amongst Africans.Consequently, recent studies have revealed a lower incidence of family history for allergy amongst them.However, many more Africans who have a positive family history of allergy, develop allergic diseases as compared to other races.The early exposure to foreign allergens from the newly adopted Western lifestyle has contributed to the higher degree or sensitization recorded amongst African infants than others.These factors account for the increased number of African children who have asthma.Risk of urban livingStudies conducted on rural Transkeians have shown that migration to urban and peri-urban settlements results in a 20 times increased risk of developing asthma symptoms, but asthma is increasing in rural areas.In Cape Town, Durban and Transkei, grass, cockroaches and cat allergy have been identified as important trigger factors for asthma respectively.Home > Publications > Guidelines, Manuals & Instructions > R &gt RED Door: Managing a Small BusinessRED

is literally blown out through the exhaust pipe!The Department of Minerals and Energy urges fuel consumers to follow these consumption-conscious driving techniques to make each litre of petrol go further.* Close the car's windows when driving, because an open window creates a drag that increases fuel consumption by as much as 20%.For a person who spends R100 a week on petrol, 20% savings could mean saving R20 a week, which adds up to R80 a month.That is money one could pay towards his/her bond or be money saved for a rainy day.* Use multigrade oil in your engine because it reduces drag.* Service your car regularly.* Use a logbook to record your fuel purchases and kilometres travelled in order to set new economic goals and to spot radical differences in the performance of your vehicle due to mechanical malfunction.* If possible establish lift clubs.* Switch to radial ply tyres because they offer less rolling resistance and longer life than the cross-ply variety.* Avoid driving with under inflated tyres because tyre pressure that is too low not only increases consumption, but also remarkably reduces tyre life.* Accelerate slowly.* Don't speed.Umphandle >

Bond.This is part of government's campaign to encourage saving.A RSA Retail Bond is an investment with the Government of South Africa which earns fixed interest for the term of the investment.You can invest any amount between R1,000 and R1 million for a period of two, three or five years.* The Benefits of an RSA Retail Bond* How It Works* Buying an RSA Retail Bond* Further InformationTHE BENEFITS OF AN RSA RETAIL BONDThere are numerous benefits to saving money by investing in an RSA Retail Bond:Safety* Interest and capital are paid electronically into your bank account, which is a very safe way of investing.* This is a paperless investment registered into your name.There is no physical certificate.Guaranteed Returns* You will earn a market-related interest rate.* The interest rate is fixed for the whole investment period.You will know exactly what your cash flow will be.* You can choose to reinvest the interest that you earn at the same rate as your Bond and thereby ensure guaranteed growth of your capital.No Risk* You may not use the RSA Retail Bonds as collateral for any loan, thus ensuring that your investment is safe.* You cannot sell the RSA Retail Bonds in the market, ensuring that you are not exposed to market risk.* If you choose to reinvest your interest, you will have no reinvestment risk.Convenience* You can buy a RSA Retail Bond electronically through the RSA Retail Bond website, or directly from the National Treasury, or from any branch of the Post Office, making it easy to invest.* Interest and capital are paid directly into your bank account on interest payment date, ensuring no delays.* The RSA Retail Bond has been tailor-made to help you take control of your own investment decisions.Accessibility* If you have an urgent need for cash, you may make an early withdrawal after 12 months but you will have to pay a penalty if there is less than R1,000 left in the Bond.Beneficiary Nomination* You can nominate one or more beneficiaries for your RSA Retail Bonds Portfolio.This means that if you die, your Retail Bond will not be tied up with the administration of estate.* If you do not nominate a beneficiary, the Retail Bond will form part of your estate.* Regardless of whether you nominate a beneficiary or not, the Bond will be taken into account when the estate duties are calculated.No Charges* There are no charges, commission or costs when you invest in RSA Retail Bonds.HOW IT WORKSIn order to invest in an RSA Retail Bond, you need to:* Be a South African citizen with a South African ID number.* Be over 18.* Have a bank account with a bank in South Africa.* Invest a minimum R1,000 and a maximum of R1 million.When you invest you will be quoted an interest rate which is fixed for the period of investment you choose.You can choose to invest for a two-year, three-year or five-year period.The interest rate for new investments is determined every month and is advertised on the RSA Retail Bond website.The rate that applies when you make the investment will apply for the entire investment period.Interest is paid out every six months on March 31 and September 30, directly into your bank account.You can choose to add the interest to your investment (i.e. reinvested it).In order to protect investors against risk, you cannot* use the Bond as

South AfricaWorld Heritage Sites in South AfricaThere are 788 World Heritage sites across the globe which are protected in order to conserve their natural beauty or cultural and historical significance.Sites listed as World Heritage Sites receive national and international recognition.Six sites in South Africa have been declared World Heritage Sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).They are:* The Cape Floral Region* Robben Island* The Greater St Lucia Wetland* uKhahlamba - Drakensberg* The Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape* The "Cradle of Humankind" (Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and Environs)THE CAPE FLORAL REGION (2004)The fynbos region of the Western and Eastern Cape has recently been recognised as a World Heritage site because of its natural beauty and scientific importance.In total, the site covers 553,000 hectares of land that are particularly rich in plant species, representing nearly 20% of Africa's flora.The unique flora of the region is of particular value to science as there is a huge diversity and density of Fynbos species within a relatively small area.The species density in the Cape Floral Region is also amongst the highest in the world and it has been identified as one of the world's 18 biodiversity hot spots.ROBBEN ISLAND (1999)The historical significance of Robben Island led to its recognition as a World heritage site in 1999.Robben Island has been used over the last five centuries as a prison, a hospital and a military base.Many of its buildings reflect its history as a maximum-security prison and so symbolize the triumph of the human spirit, of freedom, and of democracy over oppression.GREATER ST LUCIA WETLAND (1999)The St Lucia Wetlands contain a variety of landforms, including coral reefs, long sandy beaches, coastal dunes, lake systems, swamps and extensive reed and papyrus wetlands.The geographic diversity of the wetlands and their interaction with climatic elements has resulted in exceptional species diversity.The mosaic of landforms and habitat types also create breathtaking scenic vistas.The St. Lucia site consists of thirteen protected areas with a total size of 234,566 hectares.The site is the largest estuarine system in Africa and includes the southernmost extension of coral reefs on the continent.Some of the natural phenomena of the wetlands are: the large numbers of nesting turtles on the beaches, the migration of whales, dolphins and whale-sharks off-shore and enormous numbers of waterfowl.The Park also has exceptional biodiversity including some 521 bird species.UKHAHLAMBA DRAKENSBERG (2000)The magnificent geographic features of the Drakensberg and the large concentration of rock paintings in this area, have led to the uKhahlamba - Drakensberg Park's recognition as a World Heritage Site.The site is exceptional beautiful, with soaring basaltic buttresses, dramatic cutbacks, golden sandstone ramparts, rolling high altitude grasslands, pristine steep-sided river valleys and rocky gorges.This diversity of habitats protects a high level of indigenous and globally threatened species, especially birds and plants.There are also many caves and rock-shelters with the largest and most concentrated group of paintings in Africa, south of the Sahara.These paintings were made by the San people over a period of 4,000 years.The rock paintings are outstanding in quality and diversity of subject and in their depiction of animals and human beings.They represent the spiritual life of the San people who no longer live in this region.MAPUNGUBWE (2003)An area situated on the northern border of South Africa, joining Zimbabwe and Botswana, Mapungubwe was the largest kingdom on the sub-continent, before it was abandoned in the 14th century.The surviving palace sites and settlement area, as well as two earlier capital sites, present an unrivalled picture of the development of social and political structures over some 400 years.The Mapungubwe cultural landscape contains evidence for an important interchange of human values that led to far-reaching cultural and social changes in Southern Africa between 900 and 1300 AD. The remains are a remarkably complete testimony to the growth and subsequent decline of the Mapungubwe state.The remains graphically illustrate the impact of climate change and record the growth and decline of the kingdom of Mapungubwe.CRADLE OF HUMANKIND (1999)The Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and surrounding areas have produced abundant scientific information on the evolution of the human being over the past 3.5 million years, his way of life and the animals with which he lived and on which he fed.The landscape also preserves many features of that prehistoric period.The Sterkfontein area contains an exceptionally large and scientifically significant group of sites which throw light on the earliest ancestors of humankind.They constitute a vast reserve of scientific information, the potential of which is enormous.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Community Safety > Secretariat for Safety and

surprising that over 60 percent of cases of accidental poisoniong involve children under five years.WHAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF POISONING?The majority of accidental poisonings involve medicines and drugs that have been left in places that the child can reach.Children often also try drinking household products such as paraffin and cleaning fluids, especially if these have been poured into bottles or containers that usually contain drinks or food.Chronic poisoning, such as lead poisoning, may sometimes occur in children living in polluted conditions near industrial or chemical plants.CAN POISONING BE PREVENTED AND WHAT CAN I DO?Prevention:* Make sure that medicines, drugs, cooking agents and cleaning products are kept out of reach of children, in locked cupboards.* Use containers with safety screw tops for these products.* Store them in containers that will not be mistaken for cold drink or sweet bottles.* Never store food and cleaning products or food and medicines together.* Adults should avoid taking medication in front of children, as children are great imitators.* Avoid storing poisonous substances in unlabelled bottles.* Keep insect and weed killers safely out of the sight and reach of children.In industrial areas it is important that the environment is monitored to ensure that chemicals do not reach unacceptably high and dangerous levels.The Right Responses To Suspected Poisoning:* Find the substance or the container of the substance that you suspect the child has swallowed or touched.Save this to take with you to the clinic or hospital.* If the child is conscious and there are signs that he or she has swallowed poison, you may try and get the child to vomit.* If the child has swallowed a detergent or corrosive acid, do not give him or her anything to drink, because the drink might react with the poison and do more damage inside the child.* If the child has touched a substance that can cause poisoning simply by skin contact, remove clothing that might be affected and wash the skin, hair and nails - first with plain water and then using soap.Finally rinse the skin thoroughly and dry.* If the child has a poisonous substance in the eye, wash the eye gently with lukewarm water for up to ten minutes.* Keep the child comfortable and take him or her to the nearest health facility.Do Not Encourage Vomiting If:* The poison is of the type that would cause burning in the throat and digestive system (for instance, battery acid, cleaning products that contain caustic soda)* The child has swallowed paraffin because oily droplets may cause problems in the lungs and result in pneumoniaWHERE CAN I GET MORE HELP AND ADVICE?For any poisoning, contact your local clinic for professional help.The

Economic Development ProgrammeThe Minister for Provincial and Local Government launched the Local Economic Development Fund (LEDF) in August 1999.The LED Fund provides financial support, up to a maximum of R 1,5 million, to municipalities engaged in projects that will lead to job creation and is instrumental in poverty alleviation.The LED Fund is considered a key instrument to assist municipalities in taking up the challenge of developmental local government.The vision of the LED Fund is to support partnerships that are innovative and have the energy to build a strong and sustainable national economy based on thriving and diversified local economies.The LED Fund provides a significant opportunity for co-operative governance.The municipalities play a key role in the management and delivery of projects, while the provincial administration assists in project monitoring and evaluation.LED fund allocation per district area in the Western Cape (R29 million)For more

Training, Information and Counselling Centre (ATICC)WESTERN CAPE AIDS TRAINING, INFORMATION AND COUNSELLING CENTRE (ATICC): OVERVIEWThe Western Cape AIDS Training, Information and Counselling Centre (ATICC) was one of 24 such centres brought about by the National Department of Health from 1989 - 1995.The Western Cape ATICC was inaugurated on 26 July 1989.The brief was to train Health Care Providers to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Province.As the name suggests, the functions of ATICC include Training, Information and HIV Counselling and Testing.Map to ATTIC.As part of the Provincial Government of the Western Cape, the Western Cape ATICC has been responsible for the vast majority of HIV/AIDS/STI and TB prevention in the Western Cape Province.In addition to Health Care Providers, ATICC has trained, among other, such organisations as: Lifeline, FAMSA, The Red Cross Society Home-Based Carers, Nazareth House, Beautiful Gate, and many more NGOs and CBOs.ATICC enables people to take what they have learned, and assists them to translate the theoretical information into practical service within their communities.Over the past 15 years, since its inception, ATICC has trained many thousands of people within this province who now provide counselling, peer education, nursing care, home-based care, social work support and psychological support within their communities.Our VisionThe vision of ATICC is to be a leading centre in the prevention of the spread of HIV infection.Our MissionATICC's mission is to prevent the spread of HIV infection and

Standing Committee* South African Youth Commission* National Youth Council* Youth from political parties* Youth from NGO sector and religious communitiesToday I table the Western Cape Youth Commission Bill to the Provincial Parliament.It is unfortunate that it has taken 10 years to reach this point, but this Bill will help strengthen us as we face the challenges of the next decade.It may be late, but it could not have come at a more significant time in this tenth year of our freedom.Population:* 65% of the Western Cape population of 4 504 609 is under the age of 35 - we therefore have 2 928 000 youthLearning:* Only 52% of our youth who start Grade 1, finish Grade 12* Only 26.6% of those who passed matric in 2003 got university exemptions, the overwhelming majority of whom were white and IndianHIV - AIDS:Pregnancy:* 20% of pregnant women who attend public health clinics are teenagersSubstance abuse:* The National Youth Risk Behaviour Survey of 2002 found that 9.1% of learners in the Western Cape had used alcohol on school premises , 4.1% had used cannabis and 19.6% had been offered an illegal drugSexual activity:* The National Youth Risk Behaviour Survey of 2002 found that 37.8% of learners in the Western Cape have been sexually activeEmployment:* Only 3 out of a 100 Africans who enter the labour force find a job compared to 92 out of a 100 of Whites* 41.52% of economically active Africans are unemployed compared to 6.89% of Whites* 22.37% of Coloureds are unemployedSkills deficit:* 38 750 Western Cape learners wrote Matric last year, of these only 21 950 wrote Maths, of whom 4 301 passed on Higher Grade; only 12 110 wrote Science of whom 4 285 passed on Higher Grade.* According to the HSRC, apprenticeships declined from 30 000 in 1986 to 16 500 in 1998.* By November 2002 only 65% of eligible firms were paying the skills levy.At most, only 10% of these levy-paying firms were claiming grants to train staff [HSCR].The realities of day-to-day life that result from this picture are alarming.The vicious cycle of cause and effect that still disempowers and marginalizes poor, African and Coloured youth must be broken if we are to build a sustainable and inclusive democracy for all of us - with confident and accomplished people.If we are to build the Home for All, then the youth must not only be a part of our Home, but they must be an integral part.The Home for All must serve as our guarantee for the future.* A guarantee of new skills.* A guarantee of more work.* A guarantee of better human relationships.* A guarantee of inclusion.* A guarantee of recognition.* A guarantee of prosperity.* A guarantee of health.* A guarantee of learning.* A guarantee of respect.On June the 16th this year, our Province formally and officially celebrated National Youth Day for the first time.In Athlone in front of the National Youth Council, the South African Youth Commission, the ANC Youth League, NNP Jeug Aksie, student bodies such as COSAS and SASCO, Muslim and Christian youth structures - we undertook to begin drafting this Bill.In record time we have brought it to Parliament.I want to pay tribute to the drafters who have studied and assessed similar acts nationally and developed a worthy product for our Province.It is important to note that we are able to establish this Commission in this year not only because of the political will that we have demonstrated, but also through savings effected on Government programmes, thus providing the resources we need.This Province has never budgeted for a Youth Commission before.The Bill is one of the Deposits in the first 100 days.But it has a long term view and must be part of the change this Government is driving toward relevance, inclusion and sustainability.The Bill will be gazetted tomorrow.Then the process begins of public participation, discussion in the Standing Committee on Governance under Chairperson Patrick McKenzie and ultimately the adoption by Parliament for my enactment.Cabinet has done its work for now.It is now over to you.I call on the youth of our Province to support the process and to influence the final Act in ways that will serve your needs best.You must own it in every way as your own tool to build our Home for All.Scrutinise the Bill.Discuss it.Debate it.The proposed Youth Commission's role will be to help Government plan and then to monitor and evaluate the programmes of Government in terms of outcomes as they affect the youth.They will also be responsible for promoting youth unity and patriotism and to serve as the connection with National, other Provincial and Local Government youth structures.This Bill is an important advance on the National Youth Commission Act which has a socio-political focus in the context of nation building.The Western Cape Youth Commission builds on this foundation to provide explicit youth participation in socio-economic development with a focus on economic realties and necessary skills.These young leaders must be fit and committed representatives of our Province.They must also demonstrate the gender, race, religious and cultural diversities of our Province in their composition and work.The role of the Province's Youth Desk will have to change too in support of this new structure and its important work.This will be a subject for discussion for the new Commission and Government.The Provincial Youth Commission was not and may not be a flash in the pan.In preparing for last year's Growth and Development Summit it was clear that we needed to understand the need for youth empowerment, hence the Youth Economic Development Summit before the GDS and subsequent discussions with youth structures towards securing a place for our youth to be heard and supported.In closing- The Western Cape Provincial Youth Commission must send the clearest signal yet to our young citizens.We are going to support them to:* Say no to drugs* Say no to unsafe sex* Say no to gangs* Say no to despairTo put it positively, youth development in all its facets is on the agenda for this Government.You have a vital and fundamental role to play in building this Home for All.In building your Home too.Claim the space this Act will create for you and become the citizens that we need you to be.I have pleasure in tabling the Western Cape Provincial Youth Commission Bill to this House and to the youth of the Western Cape.I thank you.* Western Cape Provincial Youth Commission Draft Bill, 2004 (Draft Bill) (File type: pdf; size: 154 KB)The content on this page was last updated on 23 August 2004Home > Directories > Projects > Crime, Law & Justice > Staying Safe > 100 Day Deposits: A Safer Home for AllSafety was increased in the first 100 days, through:* training new Railway Police trainees at Phillipi College* using paid Bambanani volunteers to assist the Railway Police* upgrading police stations in high-crime areas* establishing Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences units at police stations* arresting drug lordsTRAINING RAILWAY POLICEThe new Railway Police, who will fall under the South African Police Service, first have to undergo training before they can be deployed on trains.More than 400 trainees began their training at Phillipi Training College during the 100 days period.BAMBANANI VOLUNTEERS ON TRAINSThe current Bambanani Safety on Trains Project, which involves volunteers policing trains, resulted in a decline in crime rates when tested in a pilot programme during the Safer Festive Season Programme from December 2003 - January 2004.These volunteers will continue to operate, on a paid basis until the new Railway Police are properly installed.MORE AND BETTER POLICE STATIONSAs suburbs and township in the metropolitan region of the Western Cape grow both in area as well as population, there is a need for more police stations to be opened to keep pace with this growth.During the 100 days, new or upgraded police stations were opened to begin to meet these challenges.On 30 August 2004 the upgraded Kleinvlei police station was also opened.FAMILY VIOLENCE, CHILD PROTECTION AND SEXUAL OFFENCES UNITSWhen the Detective Service of the South African Police Service was restructured, it was envisaged that isolated Child Protection Units would be replaced with Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Units.These would be based in police stations thus bringing expertise in this field closer to the people.With the opening of new FCS units during the 100 days, there should now be an FCS unit close to all Western Cape police stations.Staff in FCS units have the expertise to attend to sexual crimes committed against women and children, as they have training which helps them to investigate these crimes appropriately and with due regard to the needs of the victim.The FCS Units opened during the 100 days were located in:* Wynberg, covering Steenberg, Diep River, Grassy Park and Wynberg* Cape Town Central, covering Cape Town and Langa* Bellville, covering Khayelitsha, Delft and Elsiesriver* Caledon, covering the Overberg region* Mbekweni, covering Mbekweni and Worcester* Vredendal, covering Vredendal, Vredenburg, Clanwiliam, and Klawer.ARRESTING DRUG LORDSThe presence of known drug lords on the streets encourages disrespect for the police and the law.It was hoped that three such drug lords could be arrested during the 100 days period.Two of these arrests were successful.Home > Directories > Projects > Employment > 100 Day Deposits: A Working Home for AllWork opportunities and commuter transport were both set on the road to improvement during the first 100 days, by:* Launching the Extended Public Works Programme "Saamstaan" (stand together)* Opening the Athlone Taxi OfficeEXPANDED PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMME (SAAMSTAAN)The Saamstaan Programme will include suitable projects identified across provincial government departments and municipalities.Critical to the programme will be a training component through which unemployed people will learn practical skills.Some projects already exist and must be expanded; others have been specially conceived to get the Western Cape to work.Public Private Partnerships are also being utilized as a funding mechanism.New Saamstaan employment that will be created includes:* safety and security officers in communities, on trains, at schools and other public facilities* construction based work* repairs and maintenance of public facilities and amenities* home-based care of children, the aged and the ill* early childhood development practitioners* advisors on grant applications* community development workers* non-motorised transport and some public transport provision* market and subsistence gardening* upgrade of municipal roads, municipal pipelines, storm water drains and paving* tourist guidesExisting programmes that fall under the programme include:* Vuk'uhambe (Get up and Go; City of Cape Town) involving labour-intensive road works* Red Door (Real Enterprise Development; Economic Development and Tourism) involving a network of 35 one-stop-shop support hubs for SMMES* WECCO (Western Cape Cleanup Operations Programme; Environmental Affairs and Development Planning)* Building Maintenance Programme (Transport and Public Works) involving nine projects on Health, Education and General buildings* Zenzele (Transport and Public Works) involving a road maintenance programme* CARP (Community Access Road Programme)* Bambanani (Community Safety).The provincial government committed itself to creating a minimum of 120,000 work and training opportunities over 5 years at the provincial Growth and Development Summit, in November 2003, and Saamstaan is the beginning of the fulfilment of that promise.ATHLONE TAXI OFFICEThe minibus taxi industry is a key player in commuter transport, as it transports 45% of commuters in the province and about 60% nationally.However, it is an informal industry, with no clear strategy to effectively harness the benefits from its market and social position, and engage with the business world to maximize returns for its members.The purpose of the taxi office is to play a key role in addressing this deficiency, by* forming the administrative hub of the minibus taxi industry* creating a professional environment where industry issues can be discussed* serving as the "headquarters" for the Western Cape Provincial Taxi Council* serving as the Training Center for Provincial and National Training initiatives* projecting an image of unity and synergy to the broader minibus taxi industry* serving as a platform from where the industry can engage and interact with all relevant stakeholders and role players.The taxi office forms a key element in efforts by the Provincial Government to maintain peace and stability in the minibus taxi industry.A stable and peaceful taxi industry serves the objectives of Black Economic Empowerment while providing a safe, efficient and reliable public transport.The Taxi Office is located in Athlone on Klipfontein Road, so forming part of the Klipfontein Corridor Project, which is part of the Provincial Mobility Strategy.Home > Directories > Projects > Government & Democracy > Municipal / Local Government > Local Government Development > 100 Day Deposits: A Co-operative Home for All100 Day Deposits: A Co-operative Home for AllCo-operative government leading to increased delivery was promoted in the first 100 days, through:* Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) projects* Unblocking housing projects* Creating disaster teams* Promoting integrated governanceCONSOLIDATED MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME (CMIP)The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) was developed nationally to support municipalities to provide new infrastructure as well as to rehabilitate and upgrade existing infrastructure, particularly in disadvantaged communities.Municipalities are the primary providers of services to citizens.This includes access to water, sanitation, solid waste management, affordable and safe energy, transport, education, health services and shelter as well as effective disaster management.CMIP funds are allocated to seven project categories (water, sanitation, roads, solid waste, community facilities, community lighting and storm water).CMIP in the Western Cape over the period 1997-2004 spent R689,1 million on 1063 municipal infrastructure projects, which also created approximately 2,411 million person days of employment.During the 100 days, CMIP projects were handed over to the following municipalities:* Witzenberg* Beaufort-West* Saldanha BayHOUSING PROJECTSHousing projects may get blocked, sometimes because of the conflicting needs and demands within communities.During the first 100 days, positive steps, such as the holding of community imbizo's to resolve conflict, were taken to unblock the following housing projects:* Imizamo Yethu* Avian Park* Mbekweni* Paarl* LwandleDISASTER TEAMSA framework was created for the prevention and mitigation of fires and slow flooding in informal settlements to ensure effective disaster management in these areas.Areas that should benefit from more effective emergency response include Brown's Farm, Guguletu, Crossroads, Kosovo, Wallacedene and Doringwacht.INTEGRATED GOVERNANCEA co-operative government summit for all local government councillors was held 21 June 2004.This should result in greater co-operation between provincial and local government.* Department of Local Government (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)* Department of Local Government and Housing (Provincial Government of the Western Cape)Home > Directories > Projects > Educational > School Development > 100 Day Deposits: A Learning Home for AllLearning was supported in the first 100 days, by:* Electrifying nine schools in the province* Completion of the new Usasazo School in KhayelitshaAt the beginning of 2004 there were still twelve schools in the Western Cape operating without electricity.The schools are:Main grid:* St. Boniface Primary School, Rietpoort* Rheboksfontein Primary School, Darling* Seekoeigat , Southern Cape* Voorsorg* Bracken Hill* KliprivierAlternative source:* Klawerlei* Nuwefontein* TanquaElectrification is likely to have a profound impact on the learners in these schools.The process of electrification will continue for the remaining six schools.USASAZO SCHOOLUsasazo in isiXhosa means "dispersal" or "scattering".The word is an apt description of the history of this school.For nearly 10 years now, this school community has been in search of a permanent home.Usasazo is now finally "coming home" to permanent premises, completed in August 2004, in Bangisa Drive, Khayelitsha.The completion of the school was promised by the Premier for delivery within the first 100 days of office of the new provincial government.The story of Usasazo begins with too few schools being provided by the former Department of Education and Training in the pre-1994 years.Increased migration from the Eastern Cape to the Khayelitsha region, following the repeal of the Group Areas Act and Influx Control regulations, further increased the demand for schooling in the area.Various options were considered, and the Premier at the time, Hernus Kriel, helped to arrange premises in Ruiterwacht.However members of the local community in Ruiterwacht staged notorious demonstrations against accommodating the children in the suburb and it became clear that the Department and the KEF that they would have to seek other solutions.The KEF negotiated with the Maitland community to use an under-utilised school in the suburb.The community of Maitland supported the proposal and agreed to merge two schools already serving the community, and to make one of the schools available to learners from Khayelitsha.About 1,500 learners then moved from Ruiterwacht to Maitland to form what is now known as Usasazo Secondary School.The Department made arrangements to accommodate the remaining learners in three other schools - Vuyiseka, Esangweni and Belhar secondary schools.Belhar Secondary later changed its name to Harry Gwala Secondary.The WCED and the KEF formed a panel to interview teachers for appointment at all four schools.The first principal of Usasazo, Mr Kgati, is still principal of the school today.The contractors completed the building work in August 2004.The cost of the project was R10,7 million.This must be balanced against the fact that in recent years, the Department spent up to R3.4 million a year to transport learners from Khayelitsha to available premises in Maitland.The learners are not moving into the premises immediately, to avoid disrupting "mock matric" examinations, which end on 17 September.In the meantime, the contractor will rectify any defects found in the building and ensure that the site is ready for the learners when the school moves in during the weekend of 17 to 19 September.Home > Directories > Projects > Agricultural > AgriBusiness > 100 Day Deposits: A Nourishing Home for All100 Day Deposits: A Nourishing Home for AllAgriculture was promoted in the first 100 days, by:* Opening the Clanwilliam Agricultural School* Pursuing an export agreement with the European UnionCLANWILLIAM AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLAgricultural training became more accessible to the people of the West Coast region with the opening of the Clanwilliam Agricultural School on Friday 6 August 2004.The school, a satellite campus of the Cape Institute for Agricultural Training: Elsenburg, is specifically designed for farm workers and under-resourced farmers in the area.Satellite campuses take agricultural training to people who need it most.The first satellite campus was opened in George in 2003, and courses have also been offered in Oudtshoorn.Around 48 short courses in subjects like Agricultural and Financial Management, Life Skills, Vegetable Production, Fruit production, Viticulture, Animal production (large stock, small stock and poultry) and Agricultural Engineering are offered by the Cape Institute.Opening of the Clanwilliam Agricultural School, Friday 6 August 2004.These courses are offered on National Qualifications Framework levels 1 to 4 (pre-matriculation level), and about 2000 students are already trained annually in this way.The opening of the Clanwilliam school should increase this number, once courses get under way in October 2004.The Premier of the Western Cape, Mr Ebrahim Rasool, accompanied by the Minister of Agriculture, Cobus Dowry, opened the school at the Augsburg Gymnasium in Clanwilliam, meeting a promise made by the Premier for his first 100 days in office.EXPORT AGREEMENTIt was also hoped that within the first 100 days an agricultural export agreement for the export of bone-in lamb could be signed with the European Union (EU).This had been set in place through the signing of a protocol with the EU for the registration of sheep farms and the subsequent accreditation of a number of farms.The abattoir in Swellendam has also been approved for exports to the EU.The EU wished to inspect and approve the export system themselves before signing the agreement and were scheduled to do so in June 2004.However, the National Department of Agriculture postponed the visit of the EU to the accredited farms in the Karoo, as they do not have sufficient capacity to handle the current outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Limpopo and of avian flu among ostriches in the Karoo at the same time as a visit from the EU.The Provincial Department of Agriculture will continue to support developments toward the signing of the agreement, which is likely to be a boon to Karoo farmers.Home > Directories > Projects > Recreation & Sport > Recreation > 100 Day Deposits: A Harmonious Home for AllSport was encouraged and developed in the first 100 days, by:* funding new sports facilities in rural areas* creating and providing equipment for school cluster sports leagues* developing sports fields at disadvantaged schools* restructuring and building capacity in Sports CouncilsSPORTS FACILITIES IN RURAL AREASPeople living in rural areas generally have access to fewer sports facilities than urban dwellers - but perhaps not for long in the Western Cape.An R11m programme to upgrade or build sports facilities in ten, mostly rural local authorities of the Western Cape, was launched by the Premier and the Minister for Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation, Mr Chris Stali, in August 2004.Celebrations at the sod-turning ceremony in KayamandiThe "sod-turning ceremony" was held in Kayamandi (a township outside Stellenbosch) which is one of the selected communities.The communities selected do not have any sports facilities at all or have poor facilities in need of upgrading, and the majority are located in rural areas.The Building for Sport and Recreation Programme (BSRP) allocated R9.3 million to the project, while a further R1.7 million comes from the provincial budget allocation.Transfer payments to the selected municipalities have been concluded and construction is likely to begin at the end of September 2004.As many as 28 facilities in ten municipalities will be created or improved.The municipalities which have received this funding are:* Beaufort West Municipality (Rustedene and Nelspoort) R1.6 million for netball court, ablution blocks and new sports complex and rugby field* Kannaland Municipality (Van Wyksdorp, Calitzdorp and Ladismisth) R1.25 million for development of rugby field, completion of multi-purpose sport field and renovation of swimming pools* Laingsburg Municipality (Vleiland and Matjiesfontein) R1 million* Central Karoo (Murrayburg) R0.35 million for completion of sports complex* Knysna Municipality R0.5 million for completion of multi-purpose sports complex* Mossel Bay Municipality (Brandwatch) R0.65 million for new sports complex* Stellensbosch (Kayamnandi) R2 million for new sports complex* City of Cape Town (Maccassar) R1 million for new sport complex* Prince Albert-Klaarstroom R0.3 million for facilities lighting and security* Swartland-Kalbakraal R0.6 million for new multi-purpose sport facility and field irrigation.CLUSTER SCHOOL SPORTS LEAGUES IN FOUR AREASWhen sport fixtures are set between disadvantaged schools which are located far away from each other, many schools simply choose not to compete due to transport problems.As a result, young sports players suffer a lack of competition."Cluster sport leagues" have therefore been piloted in four disadvantaged areas to bring schools in the same area together, so that appropriate fixtures can be set up between cluster schools, to revive inter-school competition.Facilities, equipment, training and coaching are also shared among schools in the cluster system.The cluster league system has been piloted at Hanover Park, Bonteheuwel, Gugulethu, Nyanga and Phillippi, where rugby, netball, soccer and chess are successfully being played in the league system.The current winter cluster sport league fixtures are scheduled to finish by the end of September so as not to interrupt school exams.Sports equipment worth more than R500,000 was also handed over to cluster schools by Minister Stali in July 2004.The equipment was handed over to cluster committees rather than individual schools to ensure more children have use of the equipment.The sports equipment included basket balls, cricket bats and balls, volley balls, hockey kit, soccer and rugby balls, training bibs, chess sets, and table tennis equipment.A further tender for additional equipment worth R360,000 will be put out in September 2004.SPORTS FIELDS AT SCHOOLSWithout a playing field, schools cannot offer many outdoor sports.Seven disadvantaged schools were therefore given R184,000 each in August 2004 for the upgrading of playing fields, including the costs of landscaping, laying of grass and borehole irrigation.The schools were selected on the basis of need - some currently have no playing fields at all.The project is a partnership between the Department of Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation, the Safer Schools Project, the Department of Community Safety and the Multi-Agency Delivery Action Mechanism (MADAM), which brings different agencies together in combating crime.The schools which received this funding at a ceremony in Mitchell's Plain are:* AZ Berman Primary, Mitchell's Plain* Luhlaza High, Khayelitsha* Isalathiso Primary, Mossel Bay* Dr Van der Ross, Belhar* Swartberg High, Caledon* Cathkin High, HeideveldSeven schools rather than the planned ten schools were selected due to funding constraints.RESTRUCTURING AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE SPORTS COUNCILSTwo interventions were made regarding Sports Councils in the first 100 days - a "Dispute Resolution Indaba" and a "Soccer Summit".The Dispute Resolution Indaba was held in July 2004.As many as 170 delegates from 40 Western Cape sports federations participated.The Indaba was convened to find ways of lessening the administration burden on courts of sports disputes and improving capacity in sport federations.High Court Judge Deon Van Zyl and Advocate Alex Abercrombie shared their legal expertise in the fields of sport law and dispute resolution.The Indaba led to the launch of The Western Cape Dispute Resolution Forum.The Forum should be functional by April 2005, once the appropriate legislation has been passed.The Department of Cultural Affairs, Sport and Recreation is currently considering nominations for members of the Forum.A transformation and dispute unit within the Department will provide administrative support to the Dispute Resolution Forum.The summit was attended by soccer administrators from various bodies, including officials from the South African Football Association (SAFA) Provincial and National Executive.Delegates adopted a strategy to remove the stumbling blocks that retard the development and growth of soccer.This strategy included commitments to:* Strengthen and formalise relationships between SAFA, the United Schools Sports Association of South Africa (USSASA) and the South African Students Sports Union (SASSU).* Develop programmes to ensure capable leadership.* Resolve relationship problems with local authorities and clubs.* Focus on unity.* Establish a provincial organizing committee to focus on issues of development, growth and governance.* Hold a strategic planning session to develop a plan towards 2010.These four deposits were all promised by the Premier, and have been delivered within the first 100 days.The fifth promise, that of new mass-based sport recreation programmes in four nodal areas, is a long-term project which is still under development by the Department.Home > Directories > Projects > Business & Economy > Small Business > 100 Day Deposits: A Prosperous Home for AllBusinesses were stimulated in the first 100 days by:* Further financing for the Real Enterprise Development (RED) Fund* Launch of the enterprise "Incubator" project* Supporting agribusiness and tourism projectsTHE REAL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT (RED) FUNDGaining access to finance is one of the most difficult problems experienced by small businesses.Financial institutions have stringent requirements for loans, often requiring security, such as fixed property.Yet entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs often have few resources and nothing to offer as security for a loan.Lack of financing is a major factor blocking the emergence of new small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs).Minister Lynne Brown raised R35 million in total for the Red Finance Fund during the 100 days.A prerequisite for a loan from RED Finance will be that the beneficiaries participate in a comprehensive mentoring and skills development programme tailored for new enterprises and entrepreneurs.This will help the enterprises which are financed to be sustainable - and therefore also be able to repay their loans.The Department will also engage in a vigorous campaign to encourage financial institutions to change their standards so that more SMMEs may access conventional loans.THE ENTERPRISE INCUBATOR PROJECTExperts estimate that around seven out of every twelve new South African businesses don't succeed.While some of this can be attributed to inadequate financing, a key factor could also be a lack of mentoring and support.To address this problem, the representatives of the Western Cape's four social partners, Community, Labour, Business and Government, resolved at the Provincial Growth and Development Summit held in November 2003, to launch a trial programme to help 100 existing small medium and micro enterprises to succeed through intensive mentoring and support - called "incubation".This pilot project was launched on 11 August 2004 by the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Tourism, Lynne Brown.The Department will spend R1,2 million on mentoring and supporting these businesses.Each enterprise will be given a business mentor for an unspecified length of time.The National Productivity Institute (NPI) is also being appointed to undertake a diagnosis of each enterprise.The NPI will then compile a report with a recommendation for each individual business, as well as identifying common needs.This process will take approximately two months.The Department will then issue tenders to service providers who may be able to serve these common needs.SUPPORTING AGRIBUSINESS AND TOURISM PROJECTSThe agribusiness projects were targeted based on the criteria of the Ikapa Agribusiness Fund, which is aimed at the establishment of new and economically viable agri-processing ventures among disadvantaged communities.The agribusiness projects are:* New Beginnings Wines Project (Boland)* Eikeboom Dairy Project (Boland)* Inthaba Fruit Processing Projects (West Coast)* Essential Oils Project (Central Karoo)* Asparagus (Central Karoo)* Rural Product Marketing Services* Regional Opportunities Investigation* Hydroponics Herb Farm (Central Karoo)* Mariculture Institute* Mariculture Project (Hawston)* Langkloof Honeybush Tea Project (Overberg)* Fynbos Export Initiative* Fynbos Certification Project* Rooibos Intellectual Property RightsThe Integrated Tourism Entrepreneurship Support Programme (ITESP) provides an integrated support to tourism SMME's, including access to capital, skills and markets.The intention of the programme is to remove the challenges that prevent transformation in tourism and promote demographic distribution of ownership in the industry within the province.A sum of R4 million was allocated for the 2004/2005 financial year, and a further R1.85 million has been allocated by the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) toward this project.Approximately 36 SMMEs will benefit from the programme, 22 of which have already been identified.Home >

> Traffic, Accidents & Road Safety > Traffic Fines: Frequently Asked QuestionsTraffic Fines: Frequently Asked QuestionsEach municipality handles traffic fines in its jurisdiction.It is your right to view speed-camera photos and contest in writing any traffic fine you may receive.1. What are the different kinds of traffic fines?2. How long do I have to pay a traffic fine?3. How do I contest a fine?4. What happens if I don't pay or contest my traffic fine?5. Where and how can I pay my traffic fine?WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAFFIC FINES?You can get one of two kinds of fines, regardless of the traffic violation:1. A Section 56 notice or Instant Summons is given to you by a traffic officer, usually for a moving violation.It has a court date on it.2. A Section 341 notice is sent to a motorist by post for violations caught on traffic camera or for traffic tickets issued in absence of the motorists (for example, for an expired licence disk).It does not have a court date on it but is a first notice before summons.The Traffic Department will issue a second notice before summons before actually issuing the summons.HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO PAY A TRAFFIC FINE?A Section 56 notice serves as an Instant Summons, which means you have about 30 days to pay before your case goes to court.A Section 341 notice is a notice before summons, not a summons itself.You usually get two notices before the summons is issued, after which you have about another 30 days to pay (or contest your fine in writing) before your case goes to court.In total, you have approximately three months to pay a Section 341 ticket.Please note that the exact length of time you have to pay a ticket varies from municipality to municipality.Check your ticket for the payment due date.HOW DO I CONTEST A FINE?You can contest your traffic fine in writing with the municipal traffic department any time before a summons has been is issued.Remember to send a copy of your traffic fine along with your letter.The traffic department will respond to your challenge in writing.If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can wait for your summons and send your challenge, in writing, to the traffic department again.The traffic department will then present this letter to the Prosecutor on your behalf.The Prosecutor then decides whether to prosecute, in which instance the case will go in front of a magistrate, or to drop the case.Please note that writing a letter will not delay the process.If you do not reach an agreement by the court date, the case will appear in court.WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T PAY OR CONTEST MY TRAFFIC FINE?If you don't pay or contest your traffic fine by the due date and do not appear in court to present your case, a warrant for your arrest will automatically be issued when the case goes to court.WHERE AND HOW CAN I PAY MY TRAFFIC FINE?All municipalities accept cheques and postal orders by post.For safety's sake, cash should be paid in person.Some municipalities accept online bank transfers or have an online facility to view photos and make payments.Please refer to each municipality's Traffic Fines page, listed below, to find the best way to pay your fine and view speed-camera photos:LaingsburgTheewaterskloof* Cape Winelands District MunicipalityThe content on this page was last updated on 15 March 2006Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste ManagementPOLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT: OVERVIEWPollution and Waste Management aims to facilitate and develop programmes, projects, co-operative management and policy mechanisms, measures and decision-support systems to ensure integrated pollution and waste management.* Collect, analyse and disseminate relevant and current information regarding pollution and waste management* Develop and implement pollution and waste management legislation, policies, norms, standards and guidelines and ensure compliance with relevant environmental legislation.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste Management > Facilities > Recycling Depots > Overstrand RecyclingHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste Management > Facilities > Recycling Depots > Protea Park Primary Recycling DepotHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste Management > Facilities > Recycling Depots > Southern Cape RecyclingHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste Management > Services > Environmental > Environmental Management & Protection > Household RecyclingHome > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning > Environmental and Land Planning > Pollution and Waste Management > Services > Environmental > Environmental Management & ProtectionPOLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT -

a five-minute shower uses 60 litres.Shower rather that bath, but if you have to bath, run a smaller bath or share your bath.* Think before rinsing glasses and cutlery under running water.* Cut down the amount of water flushed down the toilet pan.* Check if your toilet is leaking by adding a few drops of food dye to your cistern - if the colour seeps into the bowl, you have a leak.A toilet leak can waste up to 30 litres of water an hour!* A dripping tap (one drop per second) could waste up to 30 litres of water an hour - which adds up to 10,000 litres a year!)* Make a point of checking for toilet and tap leaks in your home, school or workplace and engage a plumber to repair any problems.In most instances the money it will cost to repair the leaks can be recovered through lower water bills over a period of time (usually less than a year).* Do you wash your car with a hosepipe?Consider using two buckets of water to wash your car.This can save you up to 300 litres of water each time.Saving water in the garden:* Lawns are generally grossly over-watered and use up to four times more water than other plants.Check your irrigation system, does your water run down the street?* Only water your garden before 10:00 or after 16:00.* Consider re-using your bath water and sink water on your garden.Professional grey-water recycling systems are available on the market.* Remember this tip: watering your garden less frequently, but deeper (for longer), actually encourages a deeper root system, which results in stronger plants.This practice can make water wise plants out of most established plants.And for the Industrial and Commercial Sector:* Does the factory or building you work in, manage, or own, have automatic flushing urinals?These are the ultimate water wasters.If you cannot immediately have these modified to be user activated, please turn off the water after hours and over weekends.As an example schools doing this have saved up to R5,000 on their annual water bill.* Does your building Manager still wash down forecourts and paved areas with a hosepipe?This practice is literally water down the drain (and that means money too).* Have you had your plumbing checked for leaks?* Maintenance on toilet fittings can also save thousands of litres of unnecessarily flushed water.Toilets should flush for two to four seconds and urinals six to eight seconds, maximum.It can be a simple exercise to save 10% on your annual water bill, without drastically changing your lifestyle.Home > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > TurfhallHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > EmmausHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > GlendaleHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > Highgate HomeHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > Kairos NasorgHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > SANELHome > Directories > Facilities > Social Services > Homes for Disabled People > Sunfield HomeHome > Publications > Public Information > R &gt 10 Reasons for Supporting Immunisation10 Reasons for Supporting Immunisation1. Polio and measles are highly infectious diseases that are life-threatening and often result in long-term damage and disability.2. Immunisation is a highly effective, affordable way to combat these diseases and protect all our children.3. Immunisation is also very safe.The risk of an allergic reaction is very much smaller than for most other medicines.It hardly ever occurs.4. Mass campaigns pick up the children that have missed some of their visits to the clinic for immunisation.In this way more children are protected.5. You cannot over immunise a child.Even fully immunised children get extra benefit form mass immunisation campaigns.6. The threat of polio and measles remains a real one.Although South Africa has not experienced polio for years, it is still a problem in many countries and could be imported by a visitor.7. Many of our children are HIV-positive and they are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases.It is extra important to immunise them.8. Immunisation is a social responsibility.We can only create a measles- and polio-free environment if all children are immunised.9. Many countries are completely polio-free.South Africa is close to being recognised as polio-free by the World Health organisation.An outbreak would ruin years of hard work towards this.10. It is possible to eradicate diseases globally.Immunisation enabled us to triumph over smallpox.A polio-free world is a very real possibility.Let us join hands with other nations to achieve this.Home > Directories > Projects > Employment > Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP)Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP)The Programme's objectives are to use existing government and public entity budgets to reduce and alleviate unemployment and increase the ability of workers to earn an income, either through the labour market or through entrepreneurial activity.The goal is to alleviate unemployment for a minimum of one million people (at least 60% women, 30% youth and 2% disabled people) in South Africa between 2004 and 2009.The EPWP was announced by President Thabo Mbeki in his State of the Nation Address in February 2003.This nation-wide programme involves all spheres of government as well as state-owned enterprises.The EPWP focuses on 4 sectors:* economic* environmental* social developmentINFRASRUCTURE PROGRAMMEThis programme focuses on creating employment through civil works projects employing labour-intensive methods of contruction.Approximately 37,000 km of roads, 31,000 km of pipelines, 1,500 km of storm water drains and 150 km of urban sidewalks will be constructed.This will result in 750,000 employment opportunities for targeted unemployed people in the areas where the projects take place. (Since the average duration of these projects is four months, this translates to 250,000 person-years of employment.)All the workers employed on these projects will receive training, funded by the Department of Labour.ECONOMIC PROGRAMMEThe economic sector's learnership programme aims to include 3,000 unemployed people in entrepreneurship learnerships over the next five years.It is estimated that each micro-enterprise established will employ an additional three people.The Learnership programme will help aspiring entrepreneurs to develop the skills and experience needed to set up SMMEs.Learners will be registrated on full-time SETA-funded learnerships and supported to set up micro-business.Learning contracts will provide practical experience for learners.The learners will graduate from their learnerships with the necessary technical knowledge to run their businesses, knowledge of how to tender for public sector projects, knowledge of how to run a business, an NQF qualification, experience and a credit track record.ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMEApproximately 201,703 jobs will be created through programmes such as:* the Land Care programme* the People and Parks initiative* the Coastal Care programme* the Sustainable Land-based Livelihoods project* the Cleaning up SA programme* the Growing a Tourism Economy programme* Working for Water* the Wetlands project* the Fire programmeThis programme will result in the clearing of alien vegetation from 200,000 hectares of land, rehabilitation of 40 wetlands, the creation of 20 fire protection associations, clean up of 700 kilometres of coast, trehabilitation of 10,000 hectares of land, creation of 32 waste management programmes and creation of 150 historical and community tourism projects.SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMETwo programmes in the social development sector have been earmarked for the EPWP for 2004/5:* Home Community Based Care (HCBC)* Early Childhood Development (ECD).The Home Community Based Care programme aims to create 122,240 work opportunities (17,400 of which will be through learnerships) over five years through a three pronged programme in partnership with the Health and Welfare Sector Education Authority (HWSETA).The Early Childhood Development programme aims to develop skills amongst 19,800 child care practitioners over a period of five years, thereby increasing their capacity to generate an income and at the same time improve the care and learning environment of our children.Economic Sector: to be determinedEnvironmental and Cultural

Product - (the item, or service you present to the market)2. Price - (the amount you charge for the product, service or item)3. Place - (how and where you distribute the product)4. Promotion - (how you communicate with the marketplace to let them know about your product)These four are also called the Marketing Mix or the 4Ps.1. Product:If you know what it is that your target market needs and have the right product to match that, this means you have fulfilled the first requirement, namely Product.Your product fills a market gap that is not being addressed.To get this right, it is important to know your target market, and what they want and need.The saying: "the customer is always right" has lots of truth to it, where they the customer will talk either with their wallets or publicly about your product.It is therefore important to listen to them and act responsibly as a marketer to take their changing needs into account.2. Price:This is the second P of basic marketing.The question to ask yourself is whether you have made sure that you have the best price for your product?If you charge too much for your product, the target market group will not be able to buy it.They may not be able to afford it, or the value of your product in their minds does not match that price, so they will not pay for it.If you charge too little, the target market may think there is something fake or cheap and they may not want to associate with such pricing.Also, it is vital to know what your competitors are charging.Your competitor may have their prices wrong, and perhaps you can provide a better product at a better price!It is a mix of gut-feel and science.3. Place:This is the third P which concentrates on how you get your product to your customers; from development to the stage where it is 100% ready for purchase.Depending on your product, you will have different needs.For example, fruit growers will need a team of air-conditioned trucks to get produce to the correct sites.The other aspect of this is that you need to ensure that your product is being sold in the correct places.If you have them on the wrong sites, then you will not be reaching your main target market.4. Promotion:This is the method you use to persuade your target market to buy your product.There are various methods to do this, the most well known aspect of promotion is advertising.This is when you employ an advertising agency to design ads for your product and put them in the papers or if you have loads of advertising budget, on TV.Advertising is also called "above-the-line" marketing.Other effective types of promotion are:* Sales promotion - "marketing activities that stimulate consumer purchasing and dealer effectiveness through a combination of personal selling, advertising, and all supplementary selling activities" fromExamples of sales promotion are: In-store banners, promotional and corporate gifting and using a famous sportsperson to promote product at a mall promotion event.This also used to be called "below-the-line".Today many ad agencies speak of themselves, as "through-the-line" providing clients with all aspects of promotion, while others are "niche"; providing very specific services to clients.* Public Relations (PR) - the process of making a special effort to communicate with your target market group through articles in the newspaper about your product and through special events, which will raise the awareness of your product and make positive associations with your product.As a client, you will hire a PR agency to always be on the lookout for PR opportunities for the product of the client.All these forms of promotion cost your business money, so you need to be aware of how much return on investment you are getting for your expenditure.It needs to create sales growth for you, or there is a problem with the promotion aspect of the marketing mix.MARKET RESEARCHFor you, your ad agency and the PR agency to know the best ways to talk to your consumer or target market group, it is important that from time to time you conduct market research.This is when you design questions about your product to find out how the market sees it.From market feedback, you are able to make adjustments in your marketing plan and sometimes even your business plan to improve the business as a whole.Research can be large scale or small scale and can use quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (descriptive) measures.USEFUL LINKS* Municipal Demarcation Board: Maps, demographics, statistics, municipal profiles and other useful information for market research.

Economic Development and Tourism > Publications > Guidelines, Manuals & Instructions > U &gt Managing a Small Business : ManagementManaging a Small Business : ManagementIt is very important to plan for the future of your business.If you do not look ahead, there may be events that come your way which you do not know how to deal with.When this happens, you end up reacting to a situation rather than having a calm approach when dealing with a problem.Most business problems can be solved if you can minimise the surprises that come along the way.Reacting to a problem instead of having a general plan beforehand can lead to bad business decisions that could harm the business long term.In any business situation you would like to be in a position to take advantage of opportunities, and not be one-step behind fixing up old problems that could have been avoided through careful business planning.How often should business planning be done?Generally, business planning is an ongoing process.This process should be done before the start of every month cycle.How does one do a business plan?Commit on paper what your the sales objectives are and any other goals you need to achieve to improve the business.Once this is listed, and the month is complete, you can compare whether you have achieved these sales and the other goals at the end of each month.How do I stay on top of my field, even if I am a small business?You can do this review with other members of staff or an advisor who specializes in your field of business.Getting insight from throughout the business is useful and helps brainstorm future ideas for your business that may not have come up in day-to-day activities.An annual review is hard work but in most cases creates opportunities.This is especially true if you wish to grow your business, or launch internationally.IMPORTANT AREAS OF BUSINESS PLANNINGEmploymentExample: "What are your future staffing needs?"You also need to know when you can afford to hire more staff and what you can afford to pay them.Cash flowIn some organizations, especially small businesses, it is important to negotiate with your clients that they split payments (for example you get paid 10% up front, 30% when you complete the first phase of the project and the remainder when the entire project is completed).SalesYou need to know when there are slow times in your business.For some businesses, this could be during the winter months, for others winter could be the busiest season.To make sure you last - and thrive - from year to year, you will need to know your sales pattern over the year, so that you can make allowance for any times when there is not the same amount of money coming in from sales (sales fluctuation).If this is not worked out well, the business will not be able to pay its bills and will be threatened.If you plan properly for sales fluctuations, you will have money to tide you over in the slow months.Return to > Managing a Small Business.Home > Publications > Guidelines, Manuals & Instructions > M &gt Managing a Small Business : Human ResourcesManaging a Small Business : Human ResourcesHuman resource management relates to all matters in connection with your staff; from recruitment to grievances and termination of employment.Managing your Valuable Resources: StaffHow often have you heard business people say that their greatest assets are their employees?This is generally true, but how do you nurture these assets so they continue to contribute value to your business?These are the most important areas:* The salaries and wages you pay staff need to be competitive.You need to know what your business can afford and what industry standards are.If you can't pay as much as your competitors do, you should offer your employees some form of bonus based on the how profitable the business is.* Working conditions must be in line with the health and safety standards of the law.* You must have a written employment contract with every employee, and you must ensure that they understand the rules of their employment.This is especially important with matters connected to:* absenteeism* sick pay* under-performance* grievance procedures.Consider what would happen if a key person in your business suddenly could not work for an extended period of time.It is important to know when it is time to get formal Human Resource support for your business.Once a business reaches a specific size, you may find it necessary to employ a Human Resources Manager.The Social Plan FundIf your business experiences the threat of job losses or the whole business is itself threatened, and it can be shown that if this happens, it will affect the local, regional or national industry or sector seriously; then assistance from the government can be applied for in the form of the Social Plan Fund.This assistance includes information and services to retrenched workers and employers.The aim of the information is to try and absorb retrenched workers into the labour market.This is probably more appropriate for big businesses or industries such as clothing, mining or telecommunications where employees can be vulnerable to large scale retrenchments when global economics affect the industry negatively.However, it is important to know about the Social Plan Fund, even if you are a small business.For more information about the Social Plan Fund, contact:PO Box 3971, Pretoria, 00017th Floor, Prodinsa Building, Corner of Beatrix and Pretorius Streets, Arcadia, PretoriaTel: 0861 121

Department of Trade and Industry and administered by the Industrial Development Corporation.SPII is part of a series of innovation support measures for South African industry, the most important of these being:* Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) - administered by the National Research Foundation.THRIP supports research and development in the industry with partners from the research, academic and industrial fields, to improve the quality of the products, services and people of participant companies.It does this by providing resources and a framework for collaboration in science, engineering and technology.One of the many success stories of this programme is the invention by a small business which now has a fully researched and accepted product on the market: a special camera which checks for errors on production lines using optical technology.* Innovation Fund - administered by Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.This fund has its focus on appropriate projects requiring funding of between one and five million Rand.The projects are for larger, two to three-year collaborative projects aimed at technological innovation.The Innovation Fund is not designed to support micro-projects that could be funded through other programmes like Thrip.Contact details:SPII19 Fredman Drive, Sandown, South AfricaPO Box

all cancers in men reported to the Cancer Registry during 1996 and 1997.WHICH GROUPS ARE AT RISK?* Males with a history of undescended testicles (corrected or uncorrected).The risk increases up to 11-fold.All infant boys should be checked at birth for undescended testicles.* Men with a family history of testicular cancer.* Men with an infertility problem.EARLY DETECTIONThe individual himself detects most abnormalities in the testis.The best way to find abnormalities is through testicular self-examination.Testicular Self-Examination (TSE)TSE is best performed after washing with warm water, a warm bath or shower.Heat relaxes the scrotum, making it easier to detect any abnormalities.If you are 18 years and older, follow these steps every month:* Check for any swelling on the scrotum (a mirror may be of assistance)* Examine each testicle with both hands.Place the index finger and middle finders under the testicle with the thumbs placed on top.Cancerous lumps usually are found on the sides of the testicle, but can also be present in the middle of front of the testis.* Find the soft tube-like structure behind the testicles.This is called the epididymis, which collects and carries sperm.Familiarise yourself with this structure.Do not mistake it for a suspicious lump.Look for the following:* a small (pea-sized), painless lump in a testicle (note: not all lumps are cancerous)* an enlarged testicle* a feeling of heaviness in the testicle or groin* a change in the way the testicle feels* enlarged breasts and nipples* fluid that suddenly accumulates in the scrotum* pain in the testicle.ACTIONSIf you have sever testicular pain - get emergency care.If any lumps, enlargement, swelling or change in texture can be felt in the scrotum - see a doctor.If there is a sense of heaviness or pain - see a doctor.If there is an enlargement of the breasts and nipples and/or a sudden feeling of puffiness in the scrotum - see a doctor.If no abnormalities are found - continue with TSE until 40/45 years of age.Cancer of the testicle is highly curable, especially when detected and treated early.Removal of one testicle does not impair fertility or sexual function.Home > Publications > Guidelines, Manuals & Instructions > I &gt How to Start Up a Learnership: A Guide for EmployersHow to Start Up a Learnership: A Guide for

Services > Community CourtsGovernment has opened three Community Courts in Cape Town, Mitchell's Plain and Fezeka (Gugulethu/Mannenberg) to prosecute petty crimes in these areas.The following actions are crimes on the streets of the City of Cape Town, in terms of Provincial Notices 562/1987 and 271/1995, and people who are arrested for these reasons will be sent to the Community Courts:* drinking in public* obstructing the free movement of pedestrians or traffic after being warned not to do so* urinating or defecating in public or on the street* littering* fighting in the street* swearing in the street* shouting, screaming or causing unnecessary noise in the steet* trespassing* gambling in the street* engaging in prostitution on the street.Other petty offences or offences in terms of other by-laws, can also be sent to the Community Courts.If a person is arrested in the afternoon or evening of a weekday they will spend the night in the police station cell.The following morning they will be sent to the cells at the Community Court, where they will be assessed and processed, if possible on the same day; the aim is for those arrested to spend only one night in cells.There are no postponements of cases.Most cases are dealt with by the Community Courts within 36 hours of the person's arrest.However, if a person is arrested on a Friday or on the weekend they will have to wait until Monday morning to be transferred to the Community Court.Social workers, representatives of non-government organisations such as NICRO, and lawyers from the Legal Aid Board and university law clinics are on permanent standby at the Community Courts.Community Courts are part of the strategy to prevent major crime by dealing effectively with minor crimes.They will also help relieve the caseload of the Magistrates' Courts.Community Courts are aimed at the rehabilitation of offenders; most sentences imposed by the Community Courts involve a fine, community service, or a suspended sentence, depending on the assessment of the person arrested.021 462 5007084 690 1030* Community CourtsThe content on this page was last updated on 17 January 2005Home >

Forum (CPF) consists of organisations and institutions such as schools, ratepayers associations, civic organisations, businesses and religious institutions, working in partnership with the local police.The purpose of a CPF is to create and maintain a safe and secure environment for citizens living in the CPF's area.The CPF develops yearly community safety plans, which identify priorities and needs for the area.These priorities and needs are set by the community, through the CPF, and form part of the local police station's operational plan.A CPF may also plan and implement its own safety projects, and can apply to the provincial government for funding for these projects.Station Commissioners of local police stations are responsible for establishing CPFs in their areas.Almost all police station areas in the Western Cape have a CPF.Each CPF has its own constitution (based on a uniform constitution) and aims, and may also have Sub-Forums with specific aims.An Executive Committee of the CPF has to be elected regularly.The Station Commissioner must always be a member of the Executive Committee, but neither the chairperson nor deputy-chairperson may be police.You can contact your CPF by contacting your local police station.You can check whether your police station has a CPF by checking this list.* Police Stations* Contacting, Registering or Getting Training and

SheriffsThis brochure unpacks some of the common myths about sheriffs and explains exactly who the sheriff is and what powers they have.Sheriffs are the bearers of bad news who should be avoided at all costsSheriffs are unbiased officials of the court responsible for the serving of all court documents including summonses, notices, warrants, orders and execution of judgements and orders.A sheriff is the public face of the civil justice system.Sheriffs can break your door down, damage your property and abuse you.The South African Board for Sheriffs monitors the service provided by sheriffs and their deputies ensuring it is executed in a humane manner in terms of the Code of Conduct for Sheriffs.If anyone feels a sheriff has not acted fairly they are encouraged to report the incident to the CEO of the Board.Once a sheriff arrives at your door there is nothing you can do to fix the situation.On arrival, sheriffs will explain the contents of the document they are serving and what you need to do next.They are there to help explain the legal process but cannot give you legal advice.There is no way of knowing if the person at your door is a genuine sheriff or a debt collector.Every sheriff and deputy sheriff must be able to produce a valid identification card issued by the South Africa Board for Sheriffs.Sheriffs only represent big business.They are not there for the ordinary man in the street.It is the duty of sheriffs to serve all people, rich and poor, with empathy and dignity at all times.Sheriffs are self-appointed and do as they please.Sheriffs are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development and act under riles of, and orders from, the Court.Sheriffs should be chased away with stones and any documents served can be ignored or thrown away.If you interfere with a sheriff performing their duty or do not follow instructions given to you by the sheriff, you may be liable for prosecution.The sheriff can do nothing, if you refuse to cooperate.In terms of the law, a sheriff can enter your premises and open your house, even when you are not there.They can attach remove and sell your vehicle, furniture and other moveable property, or if necessary our immoveable property to recover your debt.Sheriffs can take anything they want from your home.Sheriffs must explain the contents of the document they are serving and may not attached and remove necessary items such as food and beds, bedding and clothes.Furthermore, they may not, subject to certain guidelines, remove all your tools that you may rely on to earn a living.Sheriffs can demand money and don't have to issue a receipt.Sheriffs are supposed to issue receipts for any monies pad and to make sure both the original and copies of documents are marked with any payment made and acknowledged with your signature or mark.You are entitled to keep a copy of the original document.If you have any questions regarding the role or function of the

Neighbourhood WatchContacting, Registering or Getting Training and Equipment for your Neighbourhood WatchA neighbourhood watch is a group of citizens from a neighbourhood who agree to form a neighbourhood watch after discussing the idea with people who live in their area.The aim of a neighbourhood watch is to encourage good relations among residents and to serve as a "watchdog" for that community, sometimes by patrolling, and sometimes by simply being alert to criminal activity and notifying the police when it occurs.The police will try to assign police reservists to supervise patrols whenever neighbourhood watches do patrol.Some neighbourhood watch members may become police reservists.Each neighbourhood watch has an area with clear boundaries, within a police area.There can be more than one neighbourhood watch in an area covered by one police station, as police station areas are very large.Your neighbourhood watch should register with the local police and Community Police Forum (CPF) in your police area.To register you must adopt a constitution and code of conduct in line with the Provincial Constitution and Code of Conduct for Neighbourhood Watch Structures.In early 2003 there were 277 registered neighbourhood watches in the Western Cape.Once your neighbourhood watch is registered, you can ask for financial and organisational support, as well as equipment and training, from the Western Cape Department of Community Safety.More than 150 neighbourhood watches in the Western Cape have already received equipment and training from the Department.The kinds of training you can get from the Department include:* conflict resolution* criminal procedure* domestic violence* human rights* fire fighting* first aid* radio procedure* self-defence.The equipment you can get from the Department includes:* accident tape* batons* first aid kits* handcuffs* jackets* reflective vests* torches* traffic cones* two-way radios* whistles.* Contacting your neighbourhood watch* Registering a neighbourhood watch* Training for neighbourhood watch membersCONTACTING YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCHTo contact your neighbourhood watch, search this list.The contact person for each registered neighbourhood watch is listed.Remember there may be more than one neighbourhood watch in your police area.Alternatively, you can contact your nearest police station or Community Police Forum.REGISTERING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCHTo register your neighbourhood watch, you need to register with the local police and local CPF, and also with the Department of Community Safety.The local police and local CPF will ask for the following information about your neighbourhood watch when you register it with them:* names and contact details of your committee members* number of members* a copy of your constitution* a copy of your code of conduct* financial statements, if the neighbourhood watch has a bank account and financial transactions have taken place* the exact area of operation, e.g. street names.The Department of Community Safety will need you to submit a form.On the form you must say that you have registered with your local police station and CPF and that you have a constitution and code of conduct that is in line with the Provincial Constitution and Code of Conduct for Neighbourhood Watch Structures.If you have any queries about registering your neighbourhood watch you can contact:John CloeteDirectorate Social Crime Prevention, Department of Community SafetyTel: 021 483 4571Fax: 021 483 2016Cell: 082 574

(By-Law) (File type: pdf; size: 262 KB)Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Staying Safe > Protection from Domestic AbuseProtection from Domestic AbuseIf you are the victim of domestic abuse and your abuser is someone with whom you are in a domestic relationship, you may apply for a protection order, in terms of the Domestic Violence Act.A protection order has conditions, which set out what the abuser may not do.Should the abuser break these conditions then he can be arrested.If the abuse involves a criminal offence a charge can be laid for that offence.The words 'domestic relationship' cover many relationships.You are in a domestic relationship with someone if you:* Are or were married to each other, whether you live together or not* Are same-sex partners, whether you live together or not* Were or are engaged, dating, or in a customary relationship, or in any relationship you or the other person believes to be romantic* Have been in a sexual relationship, even for a short time* Are the parents of a child* Share or recently shared the same home or residence.Domestic abuse' includes:* physical abuse* sexual abuse* emotional abuse* verbal abuse* psychological abuse* economic abuse* intimidation* stalking* damage to property* when you are not living together, entering your property without your permission.* any other controlling behaviour that may cause harm to your safety, health or well-being.However, if you are the victim of a type of domestic abuse that is also a crime you can choose to apply for a protection order, or lay a criminal charge, or do both.Acts of abuse which are also crimes include common assault, assault with the intention of doing grievous bodily harm, indecent assault, rape, incest, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, pointing a firearm, and abuse of animals.Once you have the protection order, if your abuser breaches (breaks the conditions of) a protection order, then that is a crime and he can be charged with the crime of contempt of court (even if the breaching act is not ordinarily a crime, for example, controlling behaviour).Having a protection order means having the power to have your abuser arrested as soon as he commits an act of abuse.All you need to do is report that he has breached the conditions, and the police must act immediately.Before getting a protection order, you can get an interim protection order quite quickly by filling in certain forms, and that interim order will specify a date at which the final order will be considered (a return date).Once a final order is made, it is permanent and can only be changed by applying to the courts.The kinds of protection you can get in a protection order include conditions that:* Your abuser must not commit any act of domestic abuse.* Your abuser must pay you rent, mortgage payments or other emergency money.* The police must seize any firearms or dangerous weapons in your abuser's possession.* The police must go with you and help you to collect your personal property.DO I HAVE TO APPLY MYSELF?CAN I APPLY FOR SOMEONE ELSE?WHAT INFORMATION DO I NEED?If it does not appear you might suffer harm, then the police may instead give your abuser a notice to appear in court on a criminal charge of breaching the protection order.* Courts* The Domestic Violence Act

> Getting Counselling as a Victim of CrimeIn the past, a police station was not a place where victims, particularly of violent crimes, could feel comfortable giving their statements to police, nor could they get counselling there for the trauma they were experiencing.The Department of Community Safety has therefore been funding 'trauma rooms', also known as 'victim comfort rooms', 'victim support rooms' or 'safe rooms' in each police station in the Western Cape.The room is supposed to be more private than the charge office, and also more comfortably furnished.The Department of Community Safety has begun the process of training volunteers in batches.The NGOs, the National Institute for Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO) and the Trauma Centre, are both assisting with training volunteers and setting up the rooms.At the moment the facilities and the help you can get vary from trauma room to trauma room.Some of the counsellors or volunteers may also not be there all the time, but are on standby, and have to be telephoned to come and help when necessary.You can click here to see what help you can get in your police station.Once you have reported the crime committed against you in the charge office at the closest police station, you should ask to go to the police station's trauma room to give your full statement there, if you are feeling traumatised.Nomfundo Walaza (Director)Trauma Centre For Survivors Of Violence And TortureCowley House, 126 Chapel Street, Woodstock, Cape TownPO Box 13124, Woodstock, 7915Tel: 021 465 7373Fax:

Crime, Law & Justice > Youth at Risk > Life Skills Training for Young PeopleLife Skills Training for Young PeopleThe Chrysalis Academy offers a social crime prevention and upliftment programme targeting "youth at risk".Its aim is to empower young people to take control of their lives and give them the tools to become economically productive and be positive change agents within their communities.This metamorphosis will take them, via intense physical, mental and spiritual development away from a life which could turn to crime and gangsterism, to one with potential for personal growth, financial security and community service.It is a preventative initiative as opposed to a rehabilitation programme.This means that it is geared to developing young adults with assessed potential for growth, rather than solving or attempting to fix existing problems.The target population is young people between the ages of 17 and 22 years old who have attained a minimum educational level of Grade 10 (Standard 8), are presently unemployed and have no criminal record.The programme is currently supported and funded by the Provincial Government.The Academy is situated on the Porter Estate in Tokai.Started in June 2000, each programme accommodates between 100 and 120 students from the Western Cape, who have undergone a rigorous selection process.Participation is entirely voluntary, and free, to all who attend.The programme is divided into 5 phases:1. Opportunity2. Orientation3. Wilderness4. Skillsand5. CommunityThe Opportunity phase incorporates the marketing of the programme to community organisations and the prospective students.The remaining 4 phases make up the 12 - week programme.During each phase the students will be exposed to extensive physical activity and sport, together with different areas of intellectual and social development.They will acquire skills which can be applied in the job market.The Orientation phase lays the foundation and establishes a disciplined daily routine where neatness and personal hygiene are emphasised.This is coupled with goal setting, motivation, problem solving and communication.The students also cover basic health and nutrition, level one first aid, fire fighting and environmental awareness.They then spend two weeks in the Wilderness phase at Outward Bound, where personal limits are tested, learning much about their strengths and weaknesses, as well as teamwork and the power of nature.Abseiling, kayaking, rock climbing and long hikes are featured in this phase.On returning to Cape Town, the students are allowed visitors for the first time since the start of the course.By this time all are supremely fit, highly motivated and their self confidence is obvious.Most of the smokers will have given up the habit by this time.Under the expert guidance of instructors from Westlake Technical College, students are introduced to the Basic Engineering Skills Training (B.E.S.T) course over the four weeks of the Skills phase.* Car maintenance* welding* brick laying* metal* woodwork* electrical circuitry and other courses, are covered in hands-on classes.In 2002 security training, tailoring and catering were added to the curriculum.Sports coaching is introduced during this phase.The final Community phase is the preparation for life in the real world and focuses on business survival skills, an introduction to computers and career guidance.A wide variety of socially acceptable activities are also engaged in such as arts and crafts, singing, chess, and reading.Throughout the programme the students are required to do community work and volunteerism is actively promoted.Affiliation with a community organisation is encouraged while much emphasis is placed on positive community work like school sports coaching, neighbourhood watch patrolling and improving their quality of life at home through greening projects and other clean-up activities.The Graduate Affairs department monitors the progress of graduates for five years after the course and ensures that information regarding any volunteer or work opportunities are communicated as an ongoing service to both graduates and stakeholders.Where 20 or more graduates exist in a particular area, community clubs have been established to assist and support them.Graduates are in great demand with 67% employed by over 70 businesses throughout the Western Cape.Unemployed graduates are absorbed into projects such as Swimsafe and Bambanani and many others run by various Government departments and organisations.The Chrysalis Academy is aimed mainly at young people from disadvantaged communities in the Western Cape between the ages of 17 and 22.If you who want to join the Chrysalis Academy you should:* be unemployed* have a minimum of Grade 10 (Standard 8)* not have a criminal record* live in the Western Cape.However, you can still apply if you don't meet these conditions.For example, if you have committed crimes or don't have enough education, you can be allowed in if a government department or an NGO refers you to the Chrysalis Academy, after carefully looking at your application.Also, if you are from outside the Western Cape you can also come to the Academy, but you may have to pay a fee.To apply to go the Chrysalis Academy, you need to fill in an application form and email or fax it to the Chrysalis Academy on 021 712 1075.You can also visit or contact the Chrysalis Academy at:Chrysalis

charges.This extra money is used to give 'top up' services in the area covered by the CID.The extra services usually include extra security and cleansing.CIDs have also been called Commercial Improvement Districts (CIDs) or Residential Improvement Districts (RIDs) in the past.An example of an established City Improvement District is the Cape Town Central City Improvement District.This CID covers the areas bordered by these roads in central Cape Town: Buitengracht, Buitensingel, Orange, Grey's Pass, Queen Victoria, Wale, Spin, Plein, Roeland, Canterbury, Darling, Castle, Strand, Adderley, Heerengracht, Old Marine, Civic, Hertzog Boulevard, Oswald Pirow and Table Bay Boulevard.The Cape Town Partnership manages the Cape Town Central CID.The service contract between the Cape Town Central CID and the City of Cape Town says that the City of Cape Town must provide extra guaranteed services in the Cape Town CID area over and above normal services, in return for the CID levy.The CID levy is a dedicated levy: the money raised from the levy must go to the CID.This means that the levy must be used for services in terms of the business plan agreed to by property owners in the CID and cannot be redistributed for use outside the CID.Levies charged to property owners are sometimes paid by property owners, or sometimes passed on to tenants, in the same way that rates are.There are more Cape Town CIDs in various stages of being established.These include the Green Point CID, the Oranjekloof CID, the Higgovale CID, the Sea Point CID and the Camps Bay CID, which all fall under the City of Cape Town.The City of Cape Town drafted a by-law for CIDs in 2003, which is in the process of being passed.This by-law gives the procedure that must be followed for establishing a CID in the City of Cape Town.Any owner of property that pays rates in the City of Cape Town area can apply to the Cape Town Council for a CID to be approved.The person making the application must pay all costs involved in the application process.The management body of the CID eventually created can reimburse some of these costs to the applicant if the application is successful.The process involves advertising for a public meeting to be held, the holding of a public meeting to discuss the CID, submitting a written application which must include an improvement plan, payment of a fee to the Council, advertising the application and considering objections to the application, getting a City Council decision, and getting majority support from ratepayers.The written application must have the written approval of at least 25% in number of the owners of rateable properties in the area, and these owners must represent 25% of the rates-based value of the properties in the area.If the Council approves the application, the CID must within six months of approval of the application get the written agreement of property owners in the area that together own at least 50% of all properties in number and at least 50% of the rates base.Only once this majority agreement has been obtained, can the management body implement the City Improvement District Plan.The management body must be a non-profit company (established in terms of Section 21 of the Companies Act), which must be created before the implementation of the City Improvement District Plan.National Government is in the process of drafting a new law called the Local Government Property Rates Bill.This new law provides for 'special rating areas' (clause 19), and gives guidelines as to how metropolitan municipalities like Cape Town should deal with special rating areas.CIDs are special rating areas.Any by-law passed will have to comply with this new law.There is only one metropolitan municipality in the Western Cape at the moment, being the City of Cape Town.The Demarcation Board decides which areas are metropolitan municipalities.For enquiries about the draft Cape

Licence* How Long is the Licence Valid For?* How Many Firearms Can One Person Own?* What if I Have an Existing Licence?* What Are My Responsibilities if I Own or Want to Own a Gun?NEW FIREARMS LEGISLATION IN EFFECT FROM 1 JULY 2004On 1 July 2004, new firearms controls entered into effect.The legislation governing the licencing of firearms is the Firearms Control Act.This law requires people who apply for firearm licences to undergo a competency test.There is a period between 2004 and Dec 2006 during which existing firearms owners will be able to renew their licences.In terms of the Act, people who apply for firearm licences will have to undergo a competency test before being able to apply for a firearm licence.SAPS will issue competency certificates to successful applicants, who will then be entitled to own firearms.HOW TO APPLY FOR A LICENCEIn order to get a licence for a firearm, you must:* Get a competency certificate* Apply for a licenceThe competency certificate is a new aspect of firearms licencing in South Africa.To get the certificate, the applicant must:* Be 21 years old* Pass a thorough background check* Not have a criminal record for a variety of crimes* Know the law* Know how to use a firearm (you must have completed a basic training course at an accredited training institution).The certificate is valid for five years and must be valid at the time of applying for the licence.The police or a court can declare you unfit to carry a firearm.This declaration lasts for five years.To apply for the competency certificate you need to complete the application form (SAPS 517) and submit it to the Designated Firearms Officer (DFO) at your nearest police station.SAPS have prepared detailed instructions on how to complete the application form for a competency certificate.If you have a valid competency certificate, you can then apply for a firearms licence.To apply for the licence you need to:* Submit an application form (Form SAP 271) at the police station nearest to your home and pay a prescribed fee by affixing a revenue stamp to the application form.SAPS have prepared detailed instructions on completing the form.* Sign a form indicating that you are aware of the law applicable to firearm owners.* Make a declaration regarding any previous convictions you may have.* Have your fingerprints taken.Only very small or satellite police stations do not have a DFO.Even if a station does not have a DFO, there will be someone at the police station who will help you.The DFO will help you with completing the form and interview you.Some DFOs require applicants to make a prior appointment.When you have submitted the application, the DFO will issue you a confirmation of receipt certificate and then process your application.The DFO will also check for a criminal record or a record of domestic violence, and whether you already have a firearm licence.Having carried out all the checks, the DFO will forward the application form and supporting documentation to the Central Firearms Register (CFR) in Pretoria, along with a recommendation on whether or not a licence should be granted.The CFR then makes the final decision.The entire process usually takes about two months, if there are no problems with the application.Should a licence be refused, you may file an appeal.HOW LONG IS THE LICENCE VALID FOR?All firearms licences must be renewed every:* Two years for business purposes* Five years for self-defence* Ten years for hunting or sports shootingHOW MANY FIREARMS CAN ONE PERSON OWN?The law limits the number of guns for which you can get a licence, depending on your needs:* One gun for self-defence* Up to four firearms for occasional hunters or sportsshooters (but only one handgun)* No limit for dedicated hunters and sports shooters, but you must prove that you are a member of a hunting or sports organisation and must show a need for additional firearms* No limit for people who use firearms for business purposes (eg security companies, firearm instructors, game hunters) but there strict conditions apply.WHAT IF I HAVE AN EXISTING LICENCE?If you have a firearm that was licensed in terms of the old legislation and the licence was valid on 30 June 2004, this licence is still valid until it is renewed in terms of the new Firearms Control Act.There is a schedule setting out when you need to renew the licence by.The schedule is linked to your date of birth.Date of BirthYear for Licence Renewal31 December to 31 March1 April to 30 June1 July to 30 September1 October to 31 DecemberIf you submitted an application for a licence before 30 June 2004, this application will still be processed.WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF I OWN OR WANT TO OWN A GUN?You must get basic training from an accredited trainer.All accredited trainers are issued with compentency certificates from SAPS.You can only buy a firearm from a registered dealer.If your firearm is lost or stolen, or our documents are damaged, you need to report this to the police.You may only own 200 rounds of ammunition for each gun you own and can only have ammunition that is suitable for that particular gun. (This does not apply to dedicated hunters or sports people.)If you need further information you can contact the appointed Designated Firearms Officer at your nearest police station.Or you can call the firearms call centre during office hours at 012 353 6111 or e-mail firearms@saps.org.za.You can also visit the SAPS website for all legislation, instructions and forms relating to firearms licences.* Firearms Control Act, 60 of 2000 (Act) (File type: pdf; size: 169 KB)* Regulations Applicable to Firearms Legislation (Regulation) (File type: pdf; size: 75 KB)* Removal of a Firearm (Service)* Firearms Control Forms (Form)* Form: Application for Licence to Possess a Firearm (Form) (File type: pdf; size: 130 KB)Home > Your Government > The Government of South Africa > Facilities > Municipal CourtsHome > Directories > Services > Agricultural > Funding & Support > Applying for Financial Assistance from the Programme for Agricultural Infrastructure Development (PAID)Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Courts & Legal Services > Municipal CourtsMunicipal CourtsMunicipal Courts deal mainly with the prosecution of traffic offences, and offences in terms of municipal by-laws, such as those for:* zoning and building* water pollution* waste management* air pollution* fireworks* informal trading* parking.You can browse some of the City of Cape Town by-laws here.Municipal Courts also deal with matters referred from the South African Police Service (SAPS) that involve traffic offences.There are ten Municipal Courts within the City of Cape Town area.You should be able to pay a traffic fine from anywhere in the City of Cape Town at any of these Municipal Courts.Most Municipal Courts are housed within the Magistrates' Court in that area.The National Department of Justice provides the magistrates for the Municipal Court.The City of Cape Town provides the prosecutors, venues and administration. (The Director of Public Prosecutions has given city council officials authority to prosecute on municipal by-law matters.The Director has the power to delegate authority to any official, or to any employee, the power to prosecute.)If you would like to pay a traffic fine, go to the enquiries desk at your nearest Municipal Court.They will send you to the relevant person who deals with the area in which your traffic offence occurred.You can then pay the fine at the cash office.Please note that the enquiries office closes at 3.00pm and the cash office at 3.30pm.If you have been summonsed to appear in a Municipal Court, the relevant Court will be indicated on your summons, as well as the time and date that you should appear.Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Police > Becoming a Police ReservistBecoming a Police ReservistTo be a police reservist you must not have a criminal record, and you must at least have passed matric.Go to your nearest police station and ask to speak to the reservist coordinator.You will have to fill in a number of application forms, and have your fingerprints taken.The application forms will be processed and considered by a selection committee.You will also have to appear before the selection committee.If you comply with all the criteria and the selection committee decides to accept your application, you will then be trained in police work, including firearms training, over a period of six months.Once you have completed all the training successfully, you'll receive a certificate of appointment and a uniform.You'll also be issued with a firearm that you may use while on duty; it remains with the police when you are off duty.You will not be issued with a firearm if you fail the firearms training.Your shifts will be determined by the station commander according to the crime trends in the area and the times when you are available.Reservists are volunteers who wish to serve the community and do not get paid for their work on duty.However, they have the same powers and duties as any police officer while they are on duty.The content on this page was last updated on 26

RapeIf you have been raped or sexually assaulted, you can report this to the police.It is your choice whether to report, but if you do not report then your case will not be investigated or prosecuted.Police are not allowed to refuse to investigate your case if you report it.However, if there is too little evidence after an investigation by the police, a prosecutor may decide not to prosecute your case.There is no time limit for reporting a rape case, while other sexual offences have a 20-year time limit.However, if you do not report quite soon after the rape happened then physical evidence may be lost and any witnesses may be difficult to find, which will make successful prosecution more difficult.Also, when you report, the police will take you to hospital where you will be given medication to prevent HIV/Aids.It is important to take this medication as soon as possible after being raped.If you are a child, or reporting on behalf of a child, the case is dealt with in a different manner.* Calling the police* Making a Statement* The Medical Examination* What if the suspect gets bail?* The Trial* Support OrganisationsCALL THE POLICEYou can report rape by going to the closest police station.You can also report rape by telephoning the closest police station.If you report by phone, the police will send a police van to fetch you.However, because the police van may not be available immediately, you may have to wait a long time to be fetched.If you are badly hurt, you should call an ambulance directly or the emergency number instead.Usually, you are supposed to report rape at the police station closest to where the rape happened (which might be far away from where you live).However, if you have gone to another police station, the police are not allowed to send you away.They must do the first steps of the investigation, including opening a case docket and the medical examination, and give the case to the correct police station afterwards.At the police station, you can ask to speak to a woman police official.However, a woman may not always be available.You do not have to give all the details of what happened in the charge office when reporting the rape.After you have said that you want to report a rape, you should be taken to a private space such as an office, or to the trauma room, which is a more comfortable room that often also has trained volunteers to help you.Most police stations have trauma rooms that are supposed to be open all the time, even on weekends and at night.MAKING A STATEMENTYou need only give a brief statement of what happened and have the rape recorded in the occurrence book (a book in which all crimes are recorded) at the police station, before being taken to have a medical examination.You should try to give a detailed description of the rapist and where you last saw him immediately so that the police can try to arrest him as soon as possible.THE MEDICAL EXAMINATIONA state doctor (the District Surgeon) will do the medical examination, usually at a hospital.You can get a private doctor to do the examination, but they are often not trained in collecting forensic evidence and may not have the time to go to court.The doctor must also give you medication to prevent HIV/Aids.Because the aim of the medical examination is to collect forensic evidence, you should not wash before the medical examination, as this may wash away evidence.You should also bring the clothes you were wearing at the time of the rape so that they can also be examined for evidence.If the police arrest a suspect, they may need to hold an identity parade where you will have to point out the rapist if he is one of the people in the identity parade.If the police station has a two-way mirror, then this will be used for the identity parade.You do not need to touch the suspect and you should refuse to do so if anyone asks you to.When you give your statement, you should give as much detail as possible about what happened, especially on whether the rapist threatened you and whether he was violent.Make sure the police know if you think he knows where you live and if you are afraid he might intimidate you.This is important information that will help the court decide whether he should be granted bail or not, once he is arrested.WHAT IF THE SUSPECT GETS BAIL?If the rapist is granted bail, the police must inform you, including the conditions of his bail.One of the conditions of bail is always that he will not be allowed to talk to you or threaten you in any way.If he does talk to you or if he breaks any of the other conditions, you must contact the detective dealing with your case immediately and make a statement about this.THE TRIALUnfortunately, it may take a very long time for your case to go to court for trial, and if the police cannot find enough evidence, the prosecutor may decide not to prosecute.If you have any complaints about how the police have dealt with your case, you should lodge a complaint.You can get help from any of the organisations that help survivors of sexual violence with preparing for the trial and with any other problems you may be experiencing.On the day of trial, try to arrange with the prosecutor beforehand that you will arrive early and have a separate place to sit while waiting for the trial to start, as it is common for the rapist and his supporters to make comments about you within earshot and try to intimidate you in other ways.Some courts have separate witness waiting rooms that you can use instead of waiting in the corridor with the rapist and his supporters.If the court does not have a witness waiting room, ask the prosecutor to make another office available for you.Organisations that work with

African Police Service (SAPS) may remove a firearm under certain circumstances:* If someone is in possession of a firearm without a licence, the SAPS may remove the firearm and bring a criminal charge against the person.* If someone has a licence for a firearm but poses a danger, the SAPS can declare the person unfit to possess a firearm.* Someone convicted of certain offences is deemed to be unfit to possess a firearm, and may not keep a firearm.* Illegal possessors of firearms* Licensed firearm owners* Persons convicted of other offencesILLEGAL POSSESSORS OF FIREARMSAnyone who has a firearm without a licence is committing an offence.If you report that offence to the SAPS, they can then search for and seize the firearm without a warrant.Make a statement to the SAPS at a police station stating how you know that someone has a firearm without a licence.Ask the SAPS to open a docket and investigate the matter.The SAPS will seize the firearm and a criminal case will follow.LICENSED FIREARM OWNERSLICENSED FIREARM OWNERS</divIf you believe a licensed firearm owner is dangerous and unfit to possess a firearm, make a statement about that at a police station.Ask the Designated Firearms Officer (DFO) to hold a "Section 11 hearing" to declare the person unfit to possess a firearm.The SAPS can hold this hearing if the firearm owner:* Has said they would kill or injure themselves or any other person with their firearm.* Has a mental condition, tends to be violent, or has a dependence on alcohol or drugs.* Has failed to look after the firearm properly to ensure no-one else uses it.The SAPS will deliver a notice in writing to the person, telling them to appear for a hearing.The SAPS may issue a warrant for the search and seizure of the firearm at the same time.The hearing is usually run by a superintendent of the SAPS or someone of higher rank.The person can be represented by an attorney at the hearing, and may call witnesses and cross-examine them, including the person who made the statement against them.If the person is found to be unfit to possess a firearm, all their firearms and licences must be surrendered to the SAPS.A declaration of unfitness is usually for a period of not less than two years.The Western Cape SAPS processes more successful Section 11 hearings than any other province of South Africa.In terms of the Arms and Ammunition Act of 1969, people convicted of the following crimes are automatically deemed to be unfit to possess a firearm:* possessing a firearm without a licence* pointing a firearm at another person* failing to lock away a firearm properly* negligent loss of a firearm, including theft as a result of failure to lock it away properly* unlawful firing of a firearm endangering another person or their property, or negligent handling of a firearm* any offence in which a firearm was used (unless the person paid an admission of guilt fine).Anyone convicted of these offences must surrender their firearm to the SAPS.If you know someone that has a gun and is guilty of a firearms-related offence, make a statement at a police station about that.Ask the DFO to ensure the person surrenders the firearm.PERSONS CONVICTED OF OTHER OFFENCESCourts have the discretion to declare someone unfit to possess a firearm if they are convicted, particularly on offences involving violence.If you are a victim of an offence involving violence, it's worth asking the prosecutor in the matter to ask the court for a declaration of unfitness.The prosecutor should do this after the person has been convicted and while sentencing is being decided.People convicted of the following crimes may be declared unfit to possess a firearm: high treason; sedition; terrorism; subversion; sabotage; public violence; intimidation; murder; malicious injury to property; rape; assault; robbery; theft of game; breaking or entering any premises, whether under the common law or a statutory provision, with the intent to commit an offence; kidnapping; child stealing; culpable homicide; or any conspiracy, incitement or attempt to commit any offence already referred to above.* Getting a

Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Reporting Crime > Reporting a CrimeReporting a CrimeTo report a crime that has already happened, you should telephone or visit your nearest police station.To report rape or child abuse there are special considerations that apply.In an emergency you should call the emergency police telephone number 10111 or 112.Once you have reported the crime, you should receive a case number and you should be given the name of the detective who will be investigating your case.If you are traumatised you can get help for that and if you need witness protection that is also available.If you feel a firearm needs to be removed from a dangerous person you must ask for that.If you need a protection order for domestic violence you can also begin that process at the police station.* Reporting a Missing Person (Service)Home > Directories > Services > Crime, Law & Justice > Courts & Legal Services > Getting Witness ProtectionGetting Witness ProtectionYou can be afraid of a single person or of a group of people.Anyone who is a member of your household or family, or who is close to you in any way, can apply for protection for you if you are unable to do so.You can apply for a child without the child's guardian's (parent or other person responsible for the child) permission if:* The guardian is a suspect in the case that the child is a witness to, or* If the child has no guardian, or* If the guardian cannot be found, or* If it can be shown the guardian is refusing to give permission unreasonably.You are a witness if you are giving evidence (testifying in court or making an affidavit) right now, or if you may have to give evidence in the future, or if you have given evidence in the past.This evidence can be in a serious criminal case, an inquest, a commission or a tribunal, an investigation by the Independent Complaints Directorate or an asset forfeiture case.You or anyone else threatened will be removed from the dangerous situation as soon as possible.You will be placed into temporary witness protection, after which your application for permanent protection will be considered.If your application is approved then you will be placed in permanent witness protection.You must be a witness, or applying on behalf of someone who is a witness, to ask for witness protection.You must report your fears, the reason for your fears and that you want to apply for witness protection to any of the following people, who will help you to make an application:* The investigating officer (detective) who is investigating the case in which you are a witness.* The station commander or anyone who is in charge at any police station .* If you are in prison, the person in charge of the prison or a registered social worker at the prison.* The public prosecutor in the case in which you are giving evidence, or the Director of Public Prosecutions (formerly known as the Attorney-General) for that area.* Any member of the Witness Protection Unit.The person you have reported to will arrange for removal as soon as possible if you are in immediate danger.You will have to fill in an application form after being removed from the dangerous situation.The Director of the Witness Protection Unit will be told within 48 hours that you have been removed to temporary protection.You will be kept in temporary protection for no longer than two weeks.During this time a witness protection officer will investigate your application, which includes a risk assessment and an evaluation of you by a psychologist.The officer will report to the Director, who will then decide whether to extend the temporary protection, place you in permanent protection, or refuse the application.The Director might refuse the application if they think that other ways of protecting you are better than placing you in the permanent protection programme.If the Director decides permanent protection is best, you will have to sign a protection agreement.In this agreement you agree to abide by all the rules of the protection programme, which generally involve not revealing information about the programme, as well as any particular conditions that might have to apply for your case.You will not be placed in permanent protection unless you sign this agreement.The agreement is set up to ensure your own safety as well as the safety of the witness protection officers and everyone related to the programme.All witnesses who have kept to the rules of their protection agreement have remained safe.Permanent protection does not mean you will be in the protection programme for the rest of your life.Permanent protection lasts as long as the threat against you lasts, plus a phasing out period of six weeks, followed by a discharge.Discharge may involve a new identity being created for you and you may be relocated.Permanent protection, which continues until you are discharged, includes the following:* You and your extended family, where necessary, will be placed in a safe house which is furnished and self-catering (you do not have to pay for this accommodation).* You will be relocated away from the area where you usually live if that is considered necessary.* A clinical psychologist will do a trauma and psychological assessment and help you with any trauma you might be experiencing.* You will undergo an induction programme so that you will know what to expect.* If you are unemployed, you will get an allowance for your basic needs.* If you are employed, you will get a replacement salary.* If your children are with you, arrangements will be made so that they can go to school.* Some other costs will also be covered, such as your schooling, transport, clothing and medical costs.You can be removed from the protection programme if it is found that you have broken any of the rules, or it is found that you are abusing the programme in any way.The programme does not tolerate 'information peddlers', people who pretend to be witnesses so they can go on the programme.The Witness Protection Unit now also provides 'after-care' to help you to adjust after you leave permanent protection (that is, when you are discharged).During the phasing-out period, another risk assessment will be done.Discharge from permanent protection will probably involve changing your identity.You will be helped to re-integrate into society.You may also have to relocate permanently away from where you used to live.As an example of how this can be done, if you own an RDP house in one area, this can be swapped with an RDP house in another area.Everything to do with witness protection is done in terms of the Witness Protection Act 112 of 1998.There are nine regional offices of the Witness Protection Unit, one in each of the provinces.However, their exact location is not made public.If you have any queries that you want to direct to the Witness Protection Unit itself, you should contact the Head Office of the Witness Protection Unit, which is in Pretoria and forms part of the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the prosecuting authority in South Africa.Witness

Courts & Legal Services > Getting Legal AidGetting Legal AidYou will have to pass a 'means test', which means you have to show that you earn less than an amount fixed by the Legal Aid Board.This amount varies if you are single or married and also changes with time.You also have to show that you don't have any other 'liquid assets', such as money in a savings account, which could be used to pay for your legal fees.You can also only get legal aid for certain types of cases.You CANNOT get legal aid:* For a criminal case if you are going to plead guilty.* For traffic offences, including drunk driving cases.* For commercial crime charges such as fraud.* For drug dealing charges.* On your third or more criminal charge for the same kind of offence.* On a case where you have failed to pay a debt in instalments as ordered by the court.* On a case where your estate is going to be administered because you can't pay your debts.* If you are suing the Legal Aid Board itself for malpractice.* For a maintenance matter that can be decided by a maintenance officer.* Where you are applying to become insolvent (bankrupt) or have your estate administered.* Where you are suing for money (damages) for relationship-related claims such as defamation, breach of promise to marry, infringement of dignity or privacy, seduction, adultery, and alienation of affection (where you want to sue someone who has caused the person to whom you were engaged to break off the engagement).You can get legal aid for divorce cases, but NOT if:* There is a reasonable possibility that you might get together with your spouse again.* The director of the Board believes there hasn't been enough of an attempt by you and your spouse to come to an agreement.* You used legal aid before to sue for divorce but then decided not to go ahead with the divorce.* There are no children involved in the divorce.You can get legal aid for a labour matter:* If you are claiming unfair dismissal (you have been fired unfairly), as long as your claim is made within the time limits set by the Labour Relations Act.* To demand a merit report.However, legal aid will be refused if there are good reasons to believe you are not taking up a job on purpose or that you resigned from a job in order to be granted legal aid.You can also get legal aid for appeals on all these types of cases listed, whether criminal or civil (cases where you are suing or being sued).For appeals, the director of the Board must also believe that you have a reasonable chance of success.Go to a Legal Aid Board Branch Office or, if there is not one in your area, to the nearest magistrates' court to enquire about legal aid.All magistrates' courts have a legal aid officer who will help you with your legal aid enquiries.Attorneys do have a right to refuse a legal aid instruction, but they normally do not refuse.If they do refuse, a legal aid instruction can be made out to another attorney.Please note that the Legal Aid Board is not a free legal advice service.It provides financial support for legal matters to the very poor who cannot afford legal fees.However, you can get legal advice and help from law clinics attached to universities, and very often these clinics also take legal aid instructions from the Legal Aid Board.In Stellenbosch, the two organisations are in the same building.Legal Aid Board Offices (also called Justice Centres)Athlone Branch:2nd Floor, Melofin Centre, Old Klipfontein RoadTel: 021 697 5252Fax: 021 697 5316Cape Town Branch:5th Floor, Nedbank

MADE DEMOCRACY A REALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA.Cape Gateway is a government service aimed primarily at citizens of the Western Cape, providing information on local, provincial and national government.An initiative of the Provincial Government of the Western Cape (PGWC), in partnership with national and local governments, it gives easy access to government information and services.Up to now, to get information and services, citizens have had to know which government body provides them.With Cape Gateway, information is presented from a user's perspective.There are three ways to access the information Cape Gateway offers:* the website - www.capegateway.gov.za (you're surfing it right now)* the contact centre - 0860 142 142 (weekdays 8:00 - 16:00; cost of a local telephone call from anywhere in South Africa)* the walk-in centre - 142 Long Street, Cape Town (weekdays 8:00 - 16:00; speak with someone face-to-face)These three channels aim to make the Cape Gateway service accessible to the widest possible audience.This is also addressed by providing access to the information in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa (the official languages of the Western Cape).One of the aims of the South African Constitution is to establish an open democracy, characterised by transparency and accountability.Rights to access information are included as basic human rights.The Constitution places an obligation on organs of state to disseminate information held by the state as widely as possible: "Transparency must be fostered by providing the public with timely, accessible and accurate information."Section 195(g)Batho Pele (People First) is the South African government's initiative to improve the delivery of public services.Improving service delivery is one of the government's eight priorities as set out in the White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service (pdf, html)Cape Gateway is a concrete response to these principles and policies.THE FUTURECape Gateway will continue to update, translate and collect more government information pertinent to the Western Cape, and make it available in a manner that is easily accessible.Future versions will include online services and transactions with government.You can participate by making requests for information, or any other suggestions for this service to: questions@capegateway.gov.zaDEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCEThe Cape Gateway Development Project:* authors and collects content* creates tools for the Content Team to do their work* designs and builds this website.Cape Gateway Operations is responsible for:* the operation of the walk-in centre* the contact centre* the day-to-day operation of the website.These transversal teams (with members coming from different government spheres and departments) are co-ordinated by the Centre for e-Innovation.Content published on the Cape Gateway website adheres to the Cape Gateway Content Management Guidelines.Content is published on this

with problems experienced on the website?Terms and conditions of useThe purpose of the South African Services website is to provide a single source of information about services offered by the South African government.The objective is to reduce the disparity that exists between the empowered and the disempowered, the first and second economies.The website is a critical intervention aimed at ensuring that citizens will be able to interact with government.The intended users of the website are South African citizens in all parts of the country, current or prospective South African businesses or organisations, and citizens and organisations from other countries who need services from the South African government.A critical sector of users consists of the intermediaries, such as Multi-purpose Community Centres , Community Development Workers and the Batho Pele Gateway Call Centre, who will assist in facilitating use of the website by those unable to directly use the Internet.Information about government servicesThe website contains information on government services offered at national government level.Services information is categorised according to three service types:Services for people: services for South African citizens organised according to life eventsServices for organisations: services relevant to organisations and businessesServices for foreign nationals: information specifically for citizens from other countries who need relevant services from the South African government.Each of these categories is further structured in a manner that is in line with the life events sequence .The life events are further categorised according to life stages.Information for each service is arranged according to seven key areas, namely description, steps to follow, legal framework, service standard; cost, forms to complete, and contact details.Related informationThis section of the website, displayed in the right navigation bar, contains links to related websites for that life event.This version of the website makes provision for eleven languages, namely English, Afrikaans, Ndebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sepedi, Sesotho, Xitsonga, Tshivenda , Siswati and Setswana.Service information is originally written in English, whereafter it is translated into the other languages.Services information in the other languages is posted after it is translated.Other website featuresUse the contact us page to comment or enquire about the Government Services website.The www.gov.za link provides access to the South African

destination is to be after the adoption, are regulated by section 18 and can only take place if the children's court is satisfied that this will serve the child's best interests.Children are also placed in foster care, a children's home, a school of industry or place of safety by the Magistrate of a children's court, if they have been declared by the Children's Courts as children in need of care and protection.However, the child or children can be placed back into the care of a parent, care-giver or guardian where they will be supervised by a social worker.In this case, the Department

Form 13: Consent by child to adoptionConsent to the adoption must be obtained from:The mother of an illegitimate childThe child himself must also consent to the adoption where he is over 10 years of age, and the court must be satisfied that the child understands the nature and import of such consent.The foster parent where the child is in foster care and the foster parent has not himself made application for the adoption.The foster parent's consent is not necessary if he refuses or fails to indicate, in writing, whether he gives his consent within one month of being asked to do so by an assistant of the children's court.No consent is required under the following circumstances:in the case of any child whose parents are dead and for whom no guardian has been appointed; orfrom any parent-who is as a result of mental illness incompetent to give any consent;who has assaulted or ill-treated the child or allowed him to be assaulted or ill-treated; orwho has caused or conduced to the seduction, abduction or prostitution of the child or the commission by the child of immoral acts; orwhose child is by virtue of the provisions of section 16 in the custody of a foster parent or is a pupil in a children's home or a school of industries; orwho is withholding his consent unreasonably.Child Care Act, 1983The process is usually very lengthy and depends on the complexity of the

maintenanceMaintenance is the obligation to provide another person, for example a minor, with housing, food, clothing, education and medical care, or with the means that are necessary for providing the person with these essentials.This legal duty to maintain is called 'the duty to maintain' or 'the duty to support'.Who must provide maintenance?The duty to maintain is based on blood relationship, adoption, or the fact that the parties are married to each other.A child must be supported or maintained byhis or her parents, whether married, living together, separated or divorced, including parents who have adopted the child; and/orhis or her grandparents, whether or not the child's parents were married to each other.However, this varies from one case to another.The duty to support a family member is not limited to supporting a child.Any family member, irrespective of his or her age, can ask any family member to support or maintain him or her, provided that the following two conditions are met:The family member who claims support is unable to maintain himself or herself.The family member from whom maintenance is claimed is able to afford the maintenance that is claimed.What expenses may be claimed?You may claim reasonable support that is necessary for providing the child or other person who has a right to maintenance with a proper living and upbringing.This includes providing necessities such as food, clothing and housing, as well as paying for a proper education.The court may also order the father to contribute to the payment of laying-in expenses and maintenance from the date of the child's birth up to the date on which the maintenance order is granted.The court may also grant an order for the payment of medical expenses, or may order that the child be registered on the medical scheme of one of the parties as a dependant.To enable the court to grant a fair maintenance order, both parties must provide the court with proof of their expenses.Your view of the other parent's behaviour has no effect on your children's right to maintenance.You still have to pay maintenance, even if the other parentremarriesis involved in another relationshipdoes not allow you to see the children orif either party later has more children.Your duty to pay maintenance and your right of access to your children are two entirely separate matters and one has no relation to the other.However, the amount of maintenance to be paid may be amended by the court if either of the parties should bring such an application.Apply for maintenance at the magistrate's court in the district where you live.If you are in doubt, your local court will tell you at which court to apply for maintenance.Go to the relevant court and complete and submit Form A: Application for a maintenance order.In addition to the completed form, submit proof of your monthly income and expenses, such as receipts for food purchases, electricity and/or rent bill payments.The court will set a date on which you and the respondent must go to the court.A maintenance officer and an investigator will investigate your claim and look into your circumstances.The court will serve a summons on the respondent to appear in court on a specific date to discuss the matter.The respondent then has a choice between agreeing to pay the maintenance as claimed, or contesting the matter in court.If the respondent agrees to pay the maintenance as claimed, a magistrate will review the relevant documentation.He or she will then make an order, and may decide to do so without requiring the parties to appear in court.If the person who is allegedly liable to pay maintenance does not consent to the issuance of an order, he or she must appear in court, where evidence from both parties and their witnesses will be heard.If the court finds the person liable for paying maintenance, it will make an order for the amount of maintenance to be paid.The court will also determine when and how maintenance payments must be made.The court can order maintenance money to be paid in one of the following ways:At the local magistrate's office or any other government office designated for this purposeInto the bank or building society account designated by the person concernedDirectly to the person who is entitled to the moneyBy means of an order that directs the employer of the person who is liable for paying maintenance to deduct the maintenance payment directly from the employee's salary, in accordance with the new Maintenance Act, 1998.Maintenance Act, 1998 and related regulationsYou will be treated equally, humanely and with dignity.Complaints will be treated as quickly and as efficiently as possible.There is no prescribed time frame for this service.The entire process, from submitting your application to receiving your first maintenance payment, may take several weeks, depending on the cooperation of both parties.Witnesses who attend the proceedings, including the person who claims maintenance, are entitled to prescribed subsistence and travelling allowances.However, the court will decide at its own discretion whether such an allowance will be paid to the person against whom a maintenance order may be made.The person who is claiming maintenance must apply to the maintenance officer for the payment of witness fees.Form A: Application for Maintenance OrderForm B: Substitution or Discharge of existing Maintenance OrderForm C1: Subpoena in terms of Section of the Maintenance Act, 1998Form C2: Subpoena in terms of Section of the Maintenance Act, 1998Form D: Notification to admit Statements by WitnessesForm E: Maintenance Order in terms of section 16 of the Maintenance Act, 1998Form J: Notice in terms of Section 19 of the Maintenance Act, 1998Form P: Application for Suspension, Amendment or Rescission of an Order for the attachment of Debts in

African diplomatic or consular mission, or by a judge, magistrate, justice of the peace or public officer of the country concerned.Although the consent should contain the names of the proposed adoptive parents, the children's court may admit consent by the child's parents or guardian which does not contain the names or any other particulars of the proposed adoptive parents if it is satisfied that the best interests of the child will be served thereby.Withdrawing ConsentConsent must be withdrawn in writing.Should consent be withdrawn in a district other than the district in which consent was given or in which the application for adoption is to be heard, the commissioner shall immediately onotify the relevant court and social worker in which court the application for adoption will be heardnotify the commissioner who attested the consent in which court the application for adoption will be heard.The commissioner shall immediately identify the court in which the

consentthat the person concerned may be present when the application for adoption is considered unless the court, at its discretion, grants him or her permission to be present, because it is of the

customary law before this date, your marriage is recognised under this new law.When a husband already has more than one wife, all of those marriages are recognised under this new law.This Act also recognises customary marriages entered into after this date and states the rules that the people getting married under customary law must follow in order for their marriage to be recognised.A customary marriage is recognised if people getting married under customary law have complied with the following requirements:Both parties to the marriage must be above the age of eighteen years.Both parties must consent to being married under customary law.Lobola is not a necessary requirement for the validity of the customary marriage.Note that these marriages have always been recognized under customary law.When should I register my marriage?If you were married under customary law before the 15th November 2000, your marriage has to be registered with the Department of Home Affairs.If you were married after the law was passed, you should register your marriage within three months after the marriage.Customary Marriages and Community of PropertyAll customary marriages entered into after the coming into operation of the Act are in community of property.This means that the husband and wife have an equal share in the assets, money and property and also means that they share all the debts.If the parties would like their marriage to be out of community of property they will have to enter into an ante-nuptial contract prior to getting married.If they want to change after they are already married they will have to apply to the High Court.Under the Customary Marriages Act the wife has an equal right and status with the husband to decide what happens to the property.A customary wife now has the capacity to enter into a contract without the assistance of the husband.What if my husband wants to marry another wife?The husband must enter into a written agreement / contract which will state what should happen to the property and then the husband must apply to the court to approve the written contract.The court has to make sure that all the property interests of all wives are protected.What if we want to enter into a civil marriage after marriage under customary law?If your husband has no other wives, you can get married under civil law as well as customary law.However, neither of you will be able to enter into customary marriages with anyone else while you are married to each other under civil law.Either husband or wife can register the marriage at their nearest Department of Home Affairs.It is advisable that both spouses go together to register the marriage in order to make the registration go quicker.However, if the other spouse refuses you can register on your own and bring the necessary proof.Bring your identity document and complete Form A: Application for registration/enquiry into existence of customary marriage which requires you to state the following information:ID numbers, names and dates of birth of both the husband and the wifename of the parents of both the husband and wife and the name of the traditional leaderthe details of the lobola/magadi agreement, andtwo people who witnessed the marriagea letter from the traditional leader or an affidavit.The form must be confirmed and signed before a:registering officer, ordesignated person, who has been designated as such by the Director-General to perform functions in terms of these regulations.The application must be lodged with a registering officer or designated person who must then give you an acknowledgment of receipt of the application in a form of Form B: Acknowledgement of receipt of application for registration of customary marriage.The registration officer or designated person will forward the application to the nearest regional or district office of the Department for inclusion in the population register.The certificate of registration or Form C: Customary marriage certificate will be issued to you.Keep the certificate in a safe place because it important.An abridged certificate is issued immediately.An unabridged certificate takes six to eight weeks.The registering officer will inform you if he or she refuses to register a customary marriage as contemplated, stating the reasons for the refusal.The following fees are payable to the Department of Home Affairs:duplicate customary marriage certificate: R11search and reproduction of customary marriage register or of any supporting documentation in relation to the register (Provided that if needed for official purposes by a Government institution it is free of charge: R53furnishing of an extract from the customary marriage register: R53a fee of R11 is

HIV/Aids > 100 Day Deposits: A Healthy Home for AllHealth was improved in the first 100 days, by* Increasing the number of patients on anti-retroviral treatment* Improving services at problem Community Health CentresANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENTThe largest treatment site is at Tygerberg Hospital, where 464 patients are receiving treatment.The Western Cape ARV programme aims to establish 36 accredited ARV treatment sites by March 2005 and to provide daily ARV treatment to 6,000 patients (estimated to be half of those in need of treatment) by March 2005.Patients have to meet certain criteria - both medical and psychosocial - before they are given ARV treatment.Medically, the criteria are:* World Health Organisation (WHO) stage 4 disease (except for tuberculosis) OR* WHO stage 1, 2 and 3 and tuberculosis patients with CD4 count WHO stage 1, 2 and 3 and tuberculosis patients with CD4 count < 200 cells / mm³Psychosocially, the criteria are:* Demonstrated reliability, that is, attended three or more scheduled visits to an HIV clinic.* No active alcohol or substance abuse.* No untreated active depression.* Disclosure - it is highly recommended that patients either have disclosed their status to at least one friend or family member or have joined a support group.* Insight - patients need to have accepted their HIV positive status, and have insight into the consequences of HIV infection and the role of ARV treatment.* Ability to attend - patients must be able to attend the anti-retroviral centre on a regular basis (transport can be arranged for patients living far from the treatment site).Each patient is treated in line with the standard Provincial Government of the Western Cape Anti-retroviral Treatment Protocol.The protocol includes a first line of Stavudine (d4T), Lamivudine (3TC), Efavirenz (EFZ) or Nevirapine (NVP) and a second line of Didanosine (ddI), Zidovudine (AZT), Lopinavir / Ritonivar (LPV/r) ARV treatment regimen.The Department will evaluate the different models of community support and formalise community support in the next financial year.There are also three contracted organisations offering ARV therapy training to public health care workers in the Western Cape.* Foundation for Professional Development (FPD)* Medicines Information Centre (MIC), University of Cape Town* web-based training (Steve Andrews and Associates)The ARV Treatment Programme forms part of the National Comprehensive HIV and AIDS plan for which the Western Cape has been allocated R23.081 million for 2004/2005.The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has an allocation of R24.9 million, which will be made available for the period August 2004 to July 2005 for the ARV programme at five ARV sites in the Cape Metropole.IMPROVEMENTS AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRESThe communities of Elsies River, Delft, Hanover Park, Retreat, Bonteheuwel/Langa, Gugulethu, Mitchells Plain, Kraaifontein and Khayelitsha are benefiting from the delivery of an improved health service at their community health centres, as promised by the Premier.Innovations, including an appointment system, a fast lane for medicine collection and a club system for chronic stable patients, have reduced the long waiting times usually experienced at these centres.The club system for chronic stable patients involves the staff at the clinics making four- or six- monthly appointments for those patients who are on the club system.Patients are however advised that if they feel unwell they should not wait for their club appointment, but visit the nearest Community Health Centre (CHC) immediately.The Department of Health has committed itself to the regular supply of medication.Patients will no longer be sent home with an IOU slip to return the next day to collect their medication.Facility Managers have also been appointed at most clinics to ensure that that all the changes implemented will run smoothly.The Delft Community Health Centre (now known as the CHC of Excellence) takes great pride in a shelter built especially for community members to make their visit to the CHC more pleasant and comfortable.Home > Directories > Projects > Health > RehabilitationREHABILITATIONHome > Directories > Projects > Property Development & Management > Community ProjectsCOMMUNITY PROJECTSThe

MarketingHome > Tenders > How to TenderHOW TO COMPLETE A TENDER OR BIDEach tender or bid advert indicates where you can collect the documents you will need to fill in to submit your tender, and where they should be submitted.The advert also indicates a closing date.This is a very firm deadline - no late tenders can be accepted.Each tender has a number of associated forms, which must accompany the tender you submit.The specific forms you require for your tender should be listed in the tender documentation.You should consider very carefully how you fill in these forms.Get advice if you are unsure of anything.TENDER OR BID FORMS1. National and Provincial Tender Forms or Bid Documents2. Western Cape Provincial Construction Tender Forms3. Local Government Tender Forms1. NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL TENDER FORMS OR BID DOCUMENTSEach tender or bid has a number of associated forms, which must accompany the tender or bid you submit.These used to be known as 'tender forms' and are now called 'bid documents'.These bid documents have the prefix SBD and WCBD for national and provincial bid documents respectively.The forms usually required for national and provincial tenders (except Provincial construction tenders) are the following:In this document you agree to be bound by the tender or bid terms and conditions.Your taxes must be in order to be a successful with your tender or bid.This document has an 'Application for tax clearance certificate' form attached to it.You have to complete this form and hand it in at your nearest South Engican Revenue Services (SARS) office, to get a tax clearance certificate.You must then attach the original tax clearance certificate that you get from SARS, to the tender or bid documents.This certificate serves as proof that you are not in arrears with your tax payments.Which of these documents you complete depends on the subject of the tender.In this form, you motivate your price, by describing the product you will supply or the experience of the person who will perform the service.This is the document in which you declare whether or not you have a relationship (friend, family, business) with anyone who works for government.This is so that those people are not involved in awarding the tender in any way, to avoid corruption.Any contract having an imported content equivalent to or exceeding US$ 10 million has an industrial participation (IP) obligation, which must be addressed in the tender.You must fill in the SBD 6.1 form for provincial tenders even if you are not claiming any of the preference points.If you are claiming preference points, you need to fill in those of 12 documents SBD /WCBD 6.1-6.12 which relate to kinds of points you are claiming (national and provincial) as explained above.This is the contract that binds the parties should the tender be successful.There is a different form for purchases (7.1, services 7.2 or sales 7.3)There may be other forms to fill in for a specific tender or bid.These should be included with the tender or bid documents that you receive.However, a typical tender or bid package will probably have the following documents:* SBD 1 - WCBD 1* SBD 2 - WCBD 2 (Tax Certificate)* SBD 3.3 - WCBD 3.3 (Pricing schedule: Professional services)* SBD 4 - WCBD 4 (Declaration of interest)* SBD 6.1 - WCBD 6.1 (Preferential procurement points)* SBD 6.10 - WCBD 6.10 (Preferential points- local area)* SBD 6.3 - WCBD 6.3 ( Preferential points - SMME)* SBD 6.4 - WCBD 6.4 (Preferential points - local content)* SBD 6.9 - WCBD 6.9 (Preferential points - WC Province)* SBD 7.1 - WCBD 7.1 (Contract purchase)* SBD 7.2 - WCBD 7.2 (Contract services)Annexure A - GCC (General Conditions of Contract) draws special attention to certain general conditions applicable to government bids, contracts and orders; and ensures that clients are familiar with the rights and obligations of all parties involved in doing business with government.2. WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL CONSTRUCTION TENDER FORMSFor provincial construction-related tenders the usual forms are a little different; new construction "bid" forms are also in the process of being developed in 2004:* Tender declaration* General conditions for construction tenders DPW6* Additional particulars DPW.7E* Declaration of interest DPW.57E* Financial particulars* Application for tax clearance certificate WCBD2.* Preference certificate WCBD6.1.Again, there may be additional forms to complete, which will be included with the tender documents.3. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TENDER OR BID FORMSAt local level, each council may have its own forms, which you should enquire about directly.HOW TENDERS OR BIDS ARE AWARDEDThe document SBD / WCBD 6.1 explains how tenders or bids are decided.WCBD says:* The bidder obtaining the highest number of points will be awarded the contract.* Preference points shall be calculated after prices have been brought to a comparative basis.* Points scored will be rounded off to 2 decimal places.For example, if you have not indicated a price, your tender will be disqualified.Smaller mistakes or omissions may or may not disqualify you from the tender process; this is a question of interpretation of the tender rules.For example, if the rules say "may disqualify" rather than "must disqualify" for a specific mistake, it is up to the official doing the check to decide whether the mistake is important enough to this tender to disqualify you.The next phase looks at compliance of the product or services with the specifications, and price.Those which do not comply with the specifications are removed from the list, while all the tenders which comply with the specifications are listed in order of price.Those that fall in the lowest price group are then considered in a lowest price tender list.It is in this phase that the preference points come into play.All the preference points claimed by those on the list of lowest price tenders are first verified.Then the formula is applied to determine who of those on the lowest price list with verifiable points come out with the best result on points, and therefore who should be awarded the contract.In other words, preference points only come into play after the most expensive tenders have first been excluded.This is to ensure that the most expensive options do not win solely on points, and also to speed up the process, as only those on the lowest price list have their preference points verified.The Tender Bulletin shows who has won previous tenders, listing the price and other factors taken into account in awarding the tender.The content on this page was last updated on 6 September 2005Home > Publications > Public

tips …The BathroomThe presence of water and the contents of your bathroom cabinet pose numerous risks to all members of your household.* Never leave the hot tap running unattended.* Children should never be left unsupervised in the bath.* Store razors and personal hygiene products out of reach.Lock away medicines.* Don't allow any electrical appliances in the bathroom.The Living AreaThe area in which the family spends most of its time holds many potential hazards, particularly for young children.* Use safety gates on stairways.* Keep low, unbarred windows closed and restrict access to balconies.* Safety glass should be used for large glass panes such as doors.* Secure large furniture that could be tipped over and soften all sharp corners.* Tidy away loose hanging blind cords and curtain tie-backs.The KitchenThe kitchen is a particularly hazardous area due to the presence of hot electrical appliances, toxic substances and sharp objects.* Always turn the stove off at the main switch.* Try to use the back plates of the stove and keep pot handles pointing inwards.* Keep electrical cords short and out of reach.* Household cleaners, polishes and insecticides should all be locked away.* Keep knives and other sharp objects away from curious fingers.The BedroomThe bedroom may seem a safe place but there are a number of possible dangers.* Don't allow children to play on bedroom furniture unattended.Safe StorageIt is vitally important that the safety precautions you take inside the home are also applied outside.* Keep any potential hazard out of the reach of children.* Buy products that have resealable child safe closures.* Keep products in their original boxes so that they can easily be identified.* Store products such as turpentine, paint, fertilisers, gas cylinders and pool chemicals away from the general living area.* Always read the storage instructions on the packs and make sure you separate incompatible products.* Pool chlorine should be stored away from other products to prevent contamination.* Make sure that the storage area is cool, dry and well ventilated.* Do not reuse or refill empty containers.DIY SafetyIts certainly not only children who need to be protected.Taking short cuts and ignoring basic safety rules are often responsible for adult injuries around the home.* Always use the tool designed for the task and ensure that it is put away once the job is finished.* Sweep the work area when finished to prevent slips and falls.* Wear the correct safety clothing, such as goggles, face masks, protective gloves or safety boots.* Treat electricity with the care it deserves.Always switch off the power at the fuse box before carrying out repairs.* A ladder should always stand away from the wall at a distance of a quarter of the ladder's height and should never lean against glass or guttering.* Always make sure a power tool is earthed and replace worn flex.Water SafetyWith the arrival of summer your pool becomes the centre of your family's activities.Safety and hygiene are paramount to this area of your home.* Never, ever leave children unsupervised around swimming pools, garden ponds, buckets of water or water features.* Restrict access to swimming pools by the use of a pool fence or a pool safety net.* Teach children to swim from as early as 12 months.Contact “Learn to Swim” on 0861 100 456.* Don't allow children to push each other into the pool, run around the pool or hold each other under the water.* Ensure that your pool water is sparkling blue and free from harmful bacteria by using a trusted sanitiser like HTH Classic.* Contact HTH Pool Assist customer care line for further information 08600 222 40.Brought to you by HTH, in association with Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Southern Africa.CONTENTS: A Safer Home for the Whole FamilyHome > Publications > Public Information > I > A Safer Home for the Whole

Tell my Daughter of my HIV Status?Question: My friend was diagnosed with HIV 8yrs ago and is starting to get sick now.She's a single parent and is worried about who will take care of her 12 yr old daughter when she dies.She has asked me to take care of her daughter, and I will do so.The problem is that she does not know how to tell her daughter she is HIV positive.Is there anything I can do to help her?Answer: The important thing for your friend to know is that there is plenty of time to think about and plan what needs to be done.One of the hardest things HIV positive parents have to do is to tell their children they have the HIV virus.Often they may be too afraid to talk to their children.But this silence can be bad for everyone.Children worry when they see that something is wrong and may blame themselves for their parent's sickness or worries.They need to make the most of their time together.It is not an easy thing for parents to tell their children that they are HIV positive.Children may experience the same feelings that the parents felt when they first found out that they were HIV positive.For example, they may have felt scared, angry or sad.It should be remembered that these feelings are normal.She needs to be given all the correct information about HIV and AIDS. (c) Your friend needs to be sensitive to her daughter's feelings and encourage her to talk about how she feels and especially her fears about HIV and AIDS.It would also be important for your friend to ask another family member/s (whom she had already told previously) to be present after she discloses her HIV status to her daughter, to give her daughter a sense of who she is.Your being there to offer support at this time would be good, as this would help to establish a bond between you and her daughter.Allowing the young girl to share her feelings about her mother's HIV status with you would help her to feel supported.This may make it easier for her to speak to you and the other family members about her mother after she has died.She would need a lot of support now and especially at the time of her mother's death.Support for her daughter would also give your friend peace of mind.It may be useful for your friend and her daughter to establish a family tradition, something that they would enjoy doing on a regular basis.This could take place once a week perhaps.Another way to create a record of important memories could be to for them to make a memory box.Your friend could also write a letter to her daughter telling her how much she loves her and adding this to the memory box to be opened after her death.The daughter would probably find much comfort in having something tangible to remind her of her mother and the love they shared for each other.Both your friend and her daughter need a great deal of support at this time, they are fortunate that you are prepared to be there as a support base for them during this difficult period in their lives.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can I Insist That Someone Has an HIV Test before Offering Them a Job?Can I Insist That Someone Has an HIV Test before Offering Them a Job?Question: I am going to start work next month and have arranged for a domestic worker to do the housework and look after my children aged 2 and 4.I want her to have a blood test before she starts work because I am worried that she might have HIV and my children could get infected.How do I go about making sure she gets tested?Answer: Even if a person tests HIV negative before they start work, it is possible that they might become infected sometime in the future.In South Africa it is illegal to insist that someone have an HIV test before offering them a job.It is also illegal to dismiss anyone just because they are HIV positive.Even if a person who is employed decides to have an HIV test, they are not legally bound to inform their employer of the result.Should they do so, the employer is obliged to keep this information confidential.Anyone who decides to be tested must receive counselling both before and after the test is done.The person must also sign an informed consent form before blood can be taken for the test.In practical terms this means that, before the test is done, the person will receive education about HIV/AIDS, discuss the risk of testing positive and explore how they think they might cope with either a positive or negative result.The counsellor will determine why the person needs to be tested and inform him/her of their legal rights.Should the person test HIV positive, the counsellor will explore how they can prevent transmission or the virus to others.Human rights abuses have happened when employees were taken for blood tests, by their employers and without informed consent having been obtained.This constitutes an assault.Further, any health care worker who informs an employer of the employee's HIV status, without that person's consent, would be guilty of the serious offence of breaching confidentiality.Many people are concerned about becoming infected with HIV themselves, or about possible risks to their children.However, it is important to remember that HIV is not spread through casual contact.If this were the case almost all of us would be positive by now as we are constantly in contact with infected people.HIV is spread in three ways:* unprotected sex with an infected person* an HIV positive mother might infect her child during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding* exposure to blood infected with HIV.South Africa has one of the safest blood transfusion services in the world.Further, we seldom come into contact with other people's blood.The best way of preventing the spread of this disease is to arm yourself with knowledge and act accordingly.Some domestic workers who have tested HIV positive have been in the fortunate position of being able to confide in their employers and receive support.These employers recognise that people with HIV are also breadwinners and that it is the quality of their work, rather than their HIV status that is important.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Do I Come To Terms with an AIDS Death?How Do I Come To Terms with an AIDS Death?I feel so badly about it all.Why did she not tell me?What can I do?Answer: Your sadness at the death of your best friend is evident.One of the hardest things in life is to lose a dear friend, especially when there is unfinished business between you.HIV Infection has created a situation of distrust, sometimes even in the closest relationships.One of the reasons for this has been the terrible stigma associated with this illness.It is this stigma that has caused people with HIV and AIDS not to share the knowledge of their status with others, even those nearest and dearest.Receiving an HIV positive result inevitably causes a crisis for the person being told such news.Regardless of how good the counselling is that one receives, we should never underestimate the severity of the shock a person feels upon being told that the HIV test result is positive.The Counsellor herself or himself is not unaffected by the result s/he has to give.The Counsellors one meets at the Community Health Centres have received very intensive and specific counselling training which enables them to do the work that they do.Many of them have been counselling for a long time and are very experienced.They are able to provide the necessary compassionate support and accurate information in order to obtain informed consent from their clients prior to the test being done, and to contain the person's emotions once the result is known.It is of the utmost importance that people should never agree to an HIV test without first receiving the necessary Pre and Post Test Counselling from a trained counsellor.It is by way of the above explanation that I hope to reassure you that while your friend may have chosen not to confide her HIV positive status to you, she would have received the best possible support during counselling and testing.While I do not wish to minimise the intensity of your pain and bewilderment at the fact that your friend died of AIDS related complications without divulging her HIV status to you, I would like to explain what happens to a person when s/he receives an HIV positive result.A positive diagnosis generates deep emotions within the person receiving the result.The crisis generated from this experience could last for many weeks while the person concerned comes to terms with the news and works through the feelings and possible consequences of what being HIV positive means in terms of one's self, one's loved ones (family and friends) and others.When one is given a positive result one goes into shock because it can be the most devastating experience ever.Often the shock is so great that afterwards, all the person remembers is that s/he is HIV positive.Another deep emotion that comes to the fore is fear.Fear of what might happen to one, fear of the future, fear of rejection by family, friends, fear of causing hurt to one's loved ones by imparting the news to them.Speaking from many years of experience as a Counsellor, I have yet to meet a client who at some stage does not think about the effect that breaking the news of his/her HIV positive status will have on loved ones and what the consequences might be.Anger, disappointment and sometimes guilt often play major roles in the kind of decisions people make around informing loved ones.These feelings are often directed at self.Again it is important for the person to discuss these feelings in a safe and supportive environment.The people living with HIV are vulnerable, both physically and emotionally.They sometimes choose to share their vulnerability with a trained counsellor, rather than with close family or friends because to do so would be too overwhelming.It is hard to be strong for loved ones when one is feeling fragile.So people may choose to share their concerns and issues with a counsellor, where they are assured of a safe place; the space to ventilate feelings without reservation; where negative and positive feelings will be contained with respect, a non-judgmental attitude and unconditional compassion.One of the greatest fears people have is that they will lose the necessary support base provided by family and friends.The threat of this support being jeopard-ised, often drives people to keep silent about their HIV status.I understand that you have questions that might never be answered.May I suggest you give yourself permission to feel sad, angry, hurt.It will not help to suppress your feelings.At some point you may deem it appropriate to do something tangible, like visit her grave, or do something that you both enjoyed doing together that holds good memories.You will find, with time that: "Grief never diminishes, it only erupts less often.".If necessary talk to a Counsellor.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Do I Need To Consider before Disclosing my HIV Positive Status To Close Friends and Family?What Do I Need To Consider before Disclosing my HIV Positive Status To Close Friends and Family?Question: What would somebody who is thinking about disclosing his/her HIV positive status to close friends and family need to consider?Answer: Making the decision to inform close friends and family about your HIV status can be very difficult for somebody who is HIV positive.There are many things to consider before doing so, as well as different emotions that you may need to work through.The decision to disclose can be at times scary, exhausting and liberating, and sometimes these emotions can be experienced all at once.Although research has shown that support from family and friends is of tremendous benefit to somebody who is HIV positive, the process of disclosure itself can be very stressful.Somebody who is thinking about informing loved ones that he/she is HIV positive may have various questions: Who will I disclose to?How will people react?When is the best time to disclose?You are the best person to answer these questions for yourself, but the following pointers may help.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Why Do You Always Have To Use Condoms while Using Antiretroviral Drugs?Why Do You Always Have To Use Condoms while Using Antiretroviral Drugs?Question: My sister has just started using Antiretroviral drugs and I am concerned because I think I will have to start on them soon myself.She told me that her Counsellor said that everybody who takes these drugs always have to use condoms.Why?Answer: What your sister told you is true.If you do not always use a condom correctly, you stand the chance of developing drug resistant strains of HIV.This means that the drugs will not work anymore against the virus.The viral load will increase and the CD4 cells (white cells) which is our immune system, will start to drop.This situation will lead to a drug resistant strain and the virus will manage to produce more of itself.If this happened, the drugs would be ineffective.The resistant strain would then become stronger and multiply in the body.Resistance to one drug (because of not using condoms) could also prevent other classes of drugs from working.If you do not commit yourself to use condoms consistently and correctly, you could infect those people, with whom you have unprotected penetrative sex, with this drug resistant strain of the virus.That means that those people whom you may have infected, will not be able to take those drugs at the time that they are ready to do so, even though they have not taken ARVs before, because they started out with drug resistant strains.When someone is ready to start ARV therapy, it is necessary for that person to go to the ARV clinic to see the doctor, who after assessment will decide whether the person's health warrants Antiretroviral therapy.The doctor will then refer the person to the Counsellor.The Counsellor will spend time with that person in private and explain everything concerning the ARV drugs, such as, adherence, diet, living a positive lifestyle etc. The Counsellor will also answer all questions that the client may have concerning ARV therapy.It will also be necessary, thereafter, for the person to attend groups sessions as advised by the Counsellor.This does not mean that you will be required to discuss your personal issues in the presence of other people, but it enables you to learn about many issues around ARVs in a safe environment.Following the group sessions, there will also be other individual (face to face) counselling opportunities with the Counsellor, where personal issues and difficulties regarding ARVs may be discussed in private.In between these various sessions, a client is free to contact the Counsellor should problems arise, whether those problems have to do with such issues as condom use or anything else related to ARVs.Whether you are ready to be started on ARV drugs, or not, it is necessary for you to be committed to the consistent use of condoms.Your decision to do so will not only benefit society but equally importantly, it will protect you from getting resistant strains of the virus now and in the future.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Advice and Counselling on HIV and AIDS are Available for Small And Medium Sized Businesses?What Advice and Counselling on HIV and AIDS are Available for Small And Medium Sized Businesses?Question: I run a smallish business with only eighteen employees.I keep hearing about the effect of HIV/AIDS on business but I have no idea what I should be doing about it.In any case all my staff appear to be in good health.What advice can you give me?Answer: If you have eighteen employees, statistics suggest that there may be three or four infected with the HI virus.If infected employees are in an early stage of the illness they are unlikely to be showing any signs of infection as yet.However, if they are ignorant of their status and are therefore not acting appropriately, you may find in a year or two, that several of your key workers become ill at more or less the same time.For this and other important reasons it is very desirable that all your staff are provided with HIV information and are given the opportunity to be voluntarily counselled and tested to establish whether they are HIV positive.It is against the law for any company to test employees without voluntary informed consent (1) practice pre-employment testing or(2) to test existing employees without their informed consent (voluntary agreement to be tested after appropriate pre-test counselling).Having said that, you do need informed advice as to how to go about encouraging your staff to access voluntary counselling and testing.To begin with it must be recognized that staff have the right to full confidentiality about their status.In other words, even if they test positive, they are not under any obligation to disclose this to you.Often the best way to begin is to ask a qualified person to meet with you so that you can together agree on a HIV Workplace Policy which includes an education strategy suited to the particular needs of your business.The Workplace policy needs to be formulated by a task group which is fully representative in terms of the management, workers, shop stewards and union representatives.The next step might be for you to access experts who could implement your HIV/AIDS information education for your workforce outlining the main issues involved in HIV counselling and testing.The purpose of this is to inform and to correct misinformation whilst encouraging individuals to scrutinize their own attitudes and behaviour in order to make an informed decision as to whether or not they should take an HIV test.You need to be quite clear as to what your policy is with regard to HIV positive staff who are at all stages of the infection and the implications for other staff members and the company.The aims of an HIV/AIDS programme should include minimising the risk of infection as well as keeping already infected staff in a state of good health.Legally, employees may not have their services terminated just because they are HIV positive.As long as they are fit enough to carry out their duties they are entitled to remain in employment.Only if they are in an advanced stage of illness which is affecting them severely may it be justified to board them on grounds of incapacity and at that stage they would be entitled to the normal agreed benefits.Also staff may not refuse to work together with staff members who have disclosed their HIV positive status.Space allows us to deal with only some of the issues involved.For future help we suggest that you contact one of the organizations which offer advice and counselling for small and medium sized businesses.Information is available from ATICC.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Should I Go Alone or Should I Take My Sexual Partner with Me for an HIV Test?Should I Go Alone or Should I Take My Sexual Partner with Me for an HIV Test?Question: I am planning to have an HIV test.Should I go alone or should I take my sexual partner with me.If my partner accompanies me, will I have to reveal details of my sexual history in his presence.Are there circumstances in which it might be advisable to go alone?Answer: If your sexual partner agrees to accompany you and also agrees to be tested, this is usually the best scenario.One of the major goals of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is the prevention of HIV infection through behaviour change.Worldwide research has shown that when both partners are tested at the same time, the likelihood of maintaining an HIV negative status is greatly increased.One of the reasons for this is that by testing together you are demonstrating to each other your commitment to each other's well-being.Essentially you are bringing into the open the issue of trust and of being able to rely on each other not to jeopardize the health of the relationship.This does not mean however, that the partners are counselled together.On the contrary it is important that people be counselled separately before taking the test to enable a comprehensive assessment to be made of the unique risk factors applicable to each individual.This discussion is kept totally confidential .Results are also given individually to enable people who are found to be HIV positive to decide how best to handle this knowledge.At ATICC people are given the opportunity, should they so wish, to discuss their results mutually in the presence of their counsellor(s).This enables partners to explore future prevention strategies and other important issues such as trust.Sometimes only one partner tests positive.Such relationships are referred to as HIV- discordant.In such cases additional tests might be necessary to ascertain whether the partner testing negative is in the period during which the infection cannot yet be detected (ie. the "window period").On-going couple counselling is helpful during this time of uncertainty.Clearly when both partners test positive, on-going couple counselling is also beneficial in assisting the them to come to terms with their situation.There are a number of possible situations however, in which it might be advisable to come for VCT by yourself.These usually arise from relationships in which there is a measure of mistrust, poor communication and/or potential for abuse or violence.Of course there is also the situation where a relationship has just ended, but it should be remembered that it is necessary to wait for three months after the active sexual relationship has ended before presenting for a test.Another one of the advantages of both partners presenting simultaneously is that if they have had a monogamous relationship with each other for a minimum of three months the "window period" problem falls away if they both test negative.ATICC provides VCT as well as Couple Counselling by Psychologists experienced in the field of HIV/AIDS.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Will the Government's ARV Programme Work and Where Can I Get These Drugs?How Will the Government's ARV Programme Work and Where Can I Get These Drugs?Question: I have heard that government will be providing HIV positive people with antiretrovirals (ARV's) in the near future.I would like to know about how the ARV programme will work so that I can also get these drugs.Answer: You are right in saying that ARV's will be publicly available, however not all HIV positive people will need to be on ARV treatment.ARV therapy helps people living with HIV to live a longer and healthier life by lowering the amount of virus in the body (viral load) thereby enabling the immune system to get strong again.In South Africa about 5 million people have already been infected with the HI virus (1 in every 9 people) but only about 500 000 people need to take ARV's because the rest are still healthy.The only time HIV positive people will need to go onto ARV's is if they have a CD4 count below 200 (CD4 count is the test that shows how strong the immune system is) or an AIDS defining illness (e.g. extreme weight loss, meningitis, pneumonia, dementia, extrapulmony TB, cancers, fungal and parasitic infections).Therefore you would need to have met one of these two criteria before you would qualify for ARV therapy.The Western Cape planned to have 19 sites for the ARV roll out by April 2004 and a further 14 sites starting later in the year, which gives a total of 33 sites where one could become part of the ARV programme.The ARV programme will work as follows:Clients will be referred to the programme when their CD4 counts are below 200 or if they are diagnosed with an AIDS defining illness.Further criteria to be met include:The client must be committed to taking ARV triple therapy (combination of 3 drugs taken) for life.Disclosing to someone who will be a treatment "buddy' or assistant for the client to ensure adherence.This is important, as having to take many drugs at the same time of day, every day of for the rest of your life is not easy to accomplish without help.The client needs to be adherent to ensure that they have enough of the drug in their body to make sure they do not become drug resistant.Making sure that the client does not abuse substances, especially alcohol.The reason for this is to ensure that the person does not suffer from liver toxicity.In addition to which it will be very difficult to be compliant to treatment when under the influence of a substance.The client is also encouraged to follow a healthy lifestyle and is made aware of the dangers of drug interactions.ensuring that the person will be able to attend 3 information sessions and 2 individual counselling sessions.This process will take about 6 to 8 weeks to complete.The purpose of this will be to educate the client on various things including, information on what ARVs are, how they work, the side effects, the importance of adherence and drug resistance.The counsellors would also need to do a social and psychological assessment of the client in order for the medical team to decide if the client will qualify for ARV treatment.If the client does qualify then ongoing counselling and clinic visits will be needed.If the client does not yet qualify then the cousellor and the client will work together on the problem so that the client will be able to qualify.The client has to agree to take responsibility for their own health and treatment.This means taking ownership around pill taking, attending all sessions and ensuring that they comply with the conditions of the programme.In conclusion, HIV positive people will be able to receive free ARV therapy when their immune system is weak and needs to be strengthened (CD4 below 200) and when they have been able to show that they are ready for a life-long commitment to the therapy.Therefore you will need to go to your nearest clinic to be assessed as to whether you qualify for the programme.Question: Hooray!!!Answer: I'm glad to hear you are excited about the ARV's being made freely available.It is difficult for me to say you will qualify to be on ARV's.The best thing for you to do is to go to your nearest clinic or doctor and request that they refer you to an HIV clinic.At the clinic they are going to take bloods from you to test your CD4 count, which helps the doctors to determine how strong your immune system is or how high your viral load is.Remember, to qualify to be on ARV's you have to have a CD4 count of less than 200 or an AIDS defining illness.Our immune system is like our body's army.It's job is to keep us healthy by fighting any germs or diseases that attack us.The immune system is made up of special cells called CD4 cells.When a person has a strong immune system they have lots of CD4 cells.If we want to know how strong a person's immune system is, we do a CD4 count.To go back to how HIV attacks the immune system: When a person is infected with HIV, it takes over the CD4 cells.The virus stops the CD4 cells from fighting off diseases and forces them to make more viruses instead.After many years the person has a lot of virus in their blood and very few CD4 cells.When the immune system is low opportunistic infections may set in such as TB, which will lower the immune system even more, but as you know TB can be treated even if a person is HIV positive.A reminder, there is no cure for HIV.Antiretroviral drugs are medication that could help you to live a longer and healthier life, by slowing down the effects of the virus on your body.Act now so that you benefit from the available ARV program.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt How Do I Talk To My Children about HIV and AIDS?How Do I Talk To My Children about HIV and AIDS?Question: I have two children under the age of 10 years and they often ask questions about very complex issues.Recently, their questions about HIV and AIDS have become challenging to answer and I feel like I am not always sure of what to say or how I should approach the topic.I am aware however that they need to have some information.What do I do?Answer: Talking to children about difficult things could often leave parents wondering whether they have handled the questions adequately and appropriately.HIV and AIDS are such complex issues to talk about because they present a challenge to all of us.Also when we start talking about HIV and AIDS we realize that we might also have to talk about relating issues such as sex and sexuality.Your sense is absolutely spot-on that children need to have information regarding HIV and AIDS.Just as we would teach our children the rules of crossing the street in order to be safe and have a way of dealing with a potentially dangerous situation so we need to teach our children about other potentially risky situations.We are trying to raise children in an environment where violence is common, HIV infection is growing, drugs are widely spread and easily available, and high-risk sexual activity is the norm.This all means that if we are to address and talk about any of these issues, we need to firstly be encouraging open and effective communication.This would consist of both answering questions as well as listening carefully even when the topic(s) of discussion is not easy to deal with.Why is it important for parents to communicate with their children about HIV and AIDS?* Children need to be able to protect themselves* They should be equipped to take control over their bodies* To be able to cope with their feelings regarding some of the issues that the topic might raise* They also need to be prepared for challenges that might face them as teenagers or later as young adultsWhen children ask you questions it is because they trust that you are able to give them some information.Sometimes they will also ask so as to confirm or verify other sources of information that might not necessarily be accurate!Either way, it provides a good opportunity to start communicating about difficult things.Here are some tips to help you get started:* Don't Panic!Your children will probably ask some things that you are not prepared for and that could make you feel awkward.Panic, which could result in no response or a dismissal of the question, will not help.Good information can help them stay safe and make wise decisions* Encourage Talk - Be open to talking with your children about all sorts of things.Chat, share, laugh, communicate!* Start Young - The earlier you begin, the easier it is.By the time your children are teenagers they will be prepared, and less likely to make unwise choices.* Be Sensitive - Respect the stage and age that your children are at.Don't give more information than they want or need. (E.g. a 6-year-old and a 9-year-old will have different questions and concerns).If you are not sure ask for advice.Don't carry on talking when they have stopped listening.* Start Conversations - Create an environment of trust and communication.Find ways to gently start talking about difficult things NOW!* Talk Often - A once-in-a-lifetime sex talk will not give your children all the information they need.Repeat yourself.Make sure you have been understood.Children need to hear things over and over again to learn.* Be Honest - If you do not know an answer, say so.But try and say it in a way that does not stop communication.Perhaps you could suggest that the child talks to a relative or health worker.Better still, offer to go together!Try and learn with your children.* Make sure that YOU are equipped!You cannot always predict when a difficult topic is going to be raised.You do however need to be clued up on the facts regarding HIV/AIDS and you need to feel comfortable talking about difficult things.Adapted from: Loud and Clear -tips on talking to your children about difficult things!There are many sources that you could access to assist you.Some

I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Is Counselling Necessary before Having an Aids Test?Is Counselling Necessary before Having an Aids Test?Question: I want to have an AIDS test but I'm told I have to be counselled before I can be tested.Is this necessary?Answer: The law doesn't allow HIV testing to take place unless you are fully informed beforehand.The counselling is to provide you with adequate information so that you can decide whether you are ready for the test and its possible consequences.This enables you to give what is known as "informed consent."Pre-test counselling is also necessary to make sure that the timing of the test is right in order to make certain you receive a reliable result.If a test is conducted too soon after risk behaviour has taken place, the test may not give an accurate result.For example, if you had had unprotected sex within the previous thirteen weeks and were infected, with HIV on one of those occasions, testing now would be too soon to be sure of the test indicating that you have been infected.This is known as "being in the Window Period."The object of the test is to find out whether "antibodies" to HIV are present in the blood.If the body has produced cells (known as antibodies) to fight the virus then this shows that the virus has entered the body.However, it takes up to thirteen weeks from the infection date for these antibodies to be detectable and so it is necessary to wait for this period to elapse in order to make sure that the test result is reliable.In order for you to determine when you have been at risk, you first of all need to know what are the various ways in which you could become infected and what are the relevant degrees of risk.For example, some people think that 'dry' kissing is a risk, whereas it is not.By explaining what is and what is not risk behaviour we enable you to judge when you were last at risk and what is your overall degree of risk.In some cases it turns out that testing is probably not necessary.In other cases testing should be delayed, e.g. if you are in the Window Period.We also make use of the counselling session to provide information about effective preventative measures.The tests themselves are very reliable.However, it is essential that they are conducted at the right time, so a great deal depends on whether the information you provide about the timing and nature of your risk behaviour is accurate.Holding back information can only undermine the reliability of the test.If you are not in the Window Period and you test "Negative", the result is reliable and you are NOT infected with HIV.If, however, your test shows that you have been infected with HIV, a second, confirmatory test will be conducted to eliminate any possible error, even though our experience to date is that the second test invariably confirms the first test.Testing positive for the HIV does not necessarily mean that you have AIDS but it does mean that you can infect others.Obviously, many issues will be raised by receiving a Positive result.At ATICC we are able to offer up to six post-test sessions to support those who test positive and their partners.These sessions are provided by registered psychologists with considerable experience in this field.There is no charge and all counselling is conducted in the strictest confidence.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can My Children Contract HIV through Casual Means?Can My Children Contract HIV through Casual Means?Question: My husband recently tested HIV positive.We have been seeing a counsellor but I am still nervous about some of the things I was told.We were told that you can't get infected with HIV by sharing cups and spoons and towels, but I have three children aged 12, 10 and 7 and my nervousness stems from the fact that I worry that we might get it through casual means anyway.Answer: To be able to prevent HIV infection it is important that one understands the modes of transmission of the virus in order to prevent getting infected.Your counsellor was quite correct in saying that you cannot contract HIV from casual contact such as hugging, sharing food, sharing eating utensils, shaking hands, using the same toilet as someone with HIV, or by any other contact where blood is not transferred from the open wound of an infected person to the open wound of another person.Insects such as mosquitoes also do not spread HIV from person to person.There are four ways in which one can become infected with HIV.1. Unprotected Sexual Intercourse.Most people become infected through having unprotected sex (not using a condom).2. Mother to Child TransmissionWomen who are infected with HIV can pass the virus to their unborn babies during pregnancy, during labour and delivery, or through breast feeding.3. Receiving Infected Blood into One's Bloodstream.One could become infected if HIV infected blood comes into direct contact with that person's blood.This could happen through an open sore, sharing razor blades or needles that were used by someone already infected with HIV, from receiving infected blood during a blood transfusion.However, in South Africa all donated blood is tested for HIV before it is used in blood transfusions to ensure that the blood supply is as safe as possible.How can HIV be prevented?Parents should discuss sexuality with their children from an early age.People, especially young people, should be encouraged not to have sex until they are ready and then they need to agree with their partners to be faithful to each other in a stable relationship.Condoms should always be used during sexual contact outside of a stable, monogamous relationship.When using skin piercing instruments such as razor blades, needles or syringes, these should be new or otherwise properly sterilised.These instruments should not be shared with other people casually.Recreational drug use lowers the immune system and makes the body more susceptible to infections.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Are the Chances of my Child Contracting HIV/AIDS at Play School?What Are the Chances of my Child Contracting HIV/AIDS at Play School?Question: My child, age five years, has recently started attending a local play school.I have heard so much about HIV and AIDS, the latest being that more and more children are being infected.What are the chances of my child contracting HIV/AIDS at play school?Answer: Often HIV/AIDS is associated with and thought of as an adult concern and issue.Over the past decade, children have however received attention with regard to HIV/AIDS, not only however as those seen as affected but also as those who at risk of infection.To allay your fears, it is necessary to state that the highest risk of transmission of HIV in children is through vertical infection.Other sources of HIV infection in children are through child sexual abuse and caring for those infected (this is usually the case in older children).Increased research in the area of HIV/AIDS and children show that children who have been infected vertically often live to puberty and that these children have become more visible in certain settings.What you could possibly have come across regarding the increase in the number of infected children is what is referred to as long-term progressors.These are children who have been vertically infected, and have lived with the virus for many years before becoming ill and succumbing to the disease.These are children infected with HIV who remain relatively healthy and who manage to live through childhood.They therefore are able to do most things that "normal" children do, for example, going to school, having friends, playing games/sport, etc.There are also those referred to as short-term progressors.These are HIV positive children who also through vertical transmission have become infected, but because of severely compromised immune systems, become ill soon after birth.Within the first year they have usually experienced many illnesses and often only live until approximately age 5.During these few years, because of compromised health and functioning, they often require much more attention, and are often not as able to develop with the same freedom as other children of similar age.Often it is unlikely that "slow-progressors" would be going to play school.This said, it is important to state that while children engage in rough-and -tumble games sometimes, the likelihood of being infected at play school is very minimal.HIV is transmitted via bodily fluids, mainly blood.HIV can be passed on through:* Unprotected sexual intercourse* Intravenous drug use, using infected needles* Vertical transmission (as discussed previously)The above seem to be activities to which adults are exposed and or experience.The main factor however is exposure to blood, as this bodily fluid is the most "concentrated" with HIV.Children, while curious, might be concerned about their friend or someone who has hurt themselves and are bleeding, but are not that curious to handle blood.The sight of blood is enough for children naturally to be cautious.However, like we teach our children other important things, like their address, telephone numbers, how to cross the street, so as to be safe, we should also teach our children how to protect themselves in terms of HIV.Of course, this like all complex things we teach our children needs to be age-specific.It would therefore at "play school" age be useful to teach children what to do when there is exposure to blood.What is useful and in many schools this is what is being taught, is the following:* Do not touch the blood* Call a teacher or another adult immediately* Try to remain calm and not to crowd the injured personIt is ironic however that it is the infected child, rather than the uninfected child who is more at risk of becoming ill from shared contact.Playschools are often places where there are numerous bugs afloat.The infected child's compromised immunity places him/her in a vulnerable position to become very ill from picking up a bug that the uninfected child's immune system would be able to fight with relative ease.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can I Breastfeed my Baby if I'm HIV Positive?Can I Breastfeed my Baby if I'm HIV Positive?Question: I am pregnant and HIV positive.Is is okay for me to breastfeed my baby?I have been counselled at the MOU and heard about the MTCT program, but I'm still confused.Answer: It is understandable that you feel worried about breastfeeding your baby as you are HIV positive.It is important that you focus on what is best for your baby and to ensure that the chances of your baby being infected are limited.Sharing the fact of your HIV status with others is your choice entirely.As you were informed by the Counsellor at the MOU concerning the Mother to Child Transmission Programme, it is important that you consider all the feeding options and choose what is best suited to your baby, according to your circumstances.I don't know how much you remember from your first counselling session, but you need to choose to either exclusively breastfeed or to formula feed your baby.Exclusive breastfeeding means only breastmilk and nothing else but breastmilk (except perhaps for prescribed medicine from the clinic).No water, formula, juices, gripe water or even a dummy.All these things together with breastmilk constitutes MIXED FEEDING and this can be harmful to the babyOnce you have changed from breastfeeding to formula feeding, you should NEVER put the baby back onto the breast.This would be mixed feeding and could cause the baby to become HIV positive.The important thing about breast milk is the first milk the mother produces, called Colostrum.This lines the baby's stomach and gut, and this protects the baby from infections.Breast milk also contains all the nutrients the baby needs.It is always at the right temperature, is easily available (the more you breastfeed the more milk you produce), and it also saves time.You need to remember the basic hygiene principles of cleaning your nipples before you breastfeed to prevent infections.You have to make sure that baby latches correctly onto the nipple so that you can avoid having cracked nipples, which apart from being painful, could expose the baby to HIV infection.If you develop a cracked nipple stop feeding from that breast.Rather use the other breast and seek medical treatment immediately.For all advice, please contact your MOU or baby clinic immediately.As far as the baby is concerned, should the baby have an infection (oral thrush, gastro-enteritis etc), you need to take baby to the clinic immediately since the baby is at risk of becoming infected with HIV.From six months of age the baby can be started on certain solid foods as advised by the clinic.This brings me to the second feeding option, Formula Feeding.If you choose to formula feed your baby, then he/she needs to be exclusively formula fed for 6 months.You will need to connect with your MOU so that it can be arranged for you to leave the MOU after delivery with sufficient formula to last until your first visit to the baby clinic.At the baby clinic you will be supplied regularly with formula for six month.The most important thing to remember about formula is to prepare it exactly as instructed according to the weight and age of your baby.Any deviation could cause your baby to become ill.If you formula-feed your baby, the recommended way to do this is by cup feeding.At the clinic you will be shown how this is done.Thoroughly cleaning the cup and spoon you use is absolutely necessary in order to prevent infections to the baby.You will need to decide which option is best for you.The risk of HIV transmission will be lessened if you exclusively breastfeed your baby for not longer than four months.Formula feeding means the baby will not be at risk of getting infected with HIV, but could be at risk for other infections like gastro enteritis, pneumonia, etc.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Is it Possible To Become Infected with HIV through Oral Sex?Is it Possible To Become Infected with HIV through Oral Sex?Question: Is it possible to become infected with HIV through Oral Sex?Answer: Yes, it is possible to become infected with HIV through Oral Sex.In terms of risk, as far as it is known, there has been no research conducted to establish exactly what the rate of transmission is, through oral sex.Some opinions are that oral sex is Low to Medium Risk, while other opinions have rated it as Medium to High Risk.It should be remembered that it is by being exposed to the high risk body fluids of a person infected with HIV and by getting these body fluids into one's bloodstream, that one could become infected with HIV also.The mucus membrane starts at the mouth and lines all our internal organs.Infection can occur when there is injury to the mucus membrane.If the mucus membrane lining is intact i.e., undamaged, HIV cannot be transmitted.This lining is very delicate and can be easily injured.A practical example of how fragile this mucus membrane is: If one were to take a mouthful of hot coffee, the mucus membrane in the mouth would be scalded, become tender and inflamed.This injury could be a place of entry for HIV into the bloodstream, if the person were to engage in unprotected oral sex with an HIV infected partner.It is a known fact that at least 68% of people in any given population has oral disease of one kind or another.Oral disease, such as decayed teeth, mouth ulcers, gingivitis etc causes injury to the mucus membrane in the mouth.Therefore, anyone who has damage to the lining within their mouths could be at risk of contracting HIV infection, were they to be exposed to the high risk body fluids of an infected person during oral sex.For the purpose of oral sex, the high risk fluids are: Blood, Semen and Vaginal fluids.BLOOD: Due to the fact that some of the injuries to one's genitals are often unseen with the naked eye (tiny cuts or hidden sores) one cannot always tell whether the genitals of one's sexual partner is healthy.Therefore one could be taking small amounts of blood into one's mouth without realising it.If one's partner has a sexually transmitted infection on the genitals where there is either a discharge or a sore, one would be exposed to blood, pus etc, which could contain HIV.Other Sexually Transmitted Infections could also be transmitted to the mouth in this way e.g. Blisters (Herpes) or Syphillis or Warts.Fever blisters on the mouth could also be transmitted to the partner's genitals during unprotected oral sex.SEMEN: Since HIV is found in the semen of an HIV infected man, if he were to ejaculate into his partner's mouth, the HIV contained in the ejaculatory semen could infect the partner.From our counselling we have concluded that the number of people who practise oral sex is increasing.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can One Prevent Infection with HIV through Oral Sex?Can One Prevent Infection with HIV through Oral Sex?Question: Can one prevent infection with HIV through oral sex?Answer: Yes.If one were to practise oral sex, it would be important to ensure that:1. a condom is used for every episode of oral sex;2. at no time during oral sex on a man should ejaculation take place into the partner's mouth.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Is Antiretroviral Therapy?What Is Antiretroviral Therapy?Question: What is antiretroviral therapy?How does it work?Answer: Currently there is no cure for AIDS.However, there are drugs that can slow down the progress of HIV and thus slow down the damage to your immune system.These drugs are called antiretrovirals (ARV's).ARV's slow down the reproduction rate of HIV.Once the virus is reproducing at a slower rate, it is less able to harm your immune system.If your immune system is functioning properly, your body is less likely to become sick.Your immune system is your body's defense system against infection.Since ARV's slow down the damage to your immune system, if they are used properly, they allow you to live a longer, healthier life.The goals for ARV treatment are:1. to ensure maximum and lasting control of the amount HIV in your body;2. to restore and protect the immune functioning of the body by allowing the CD4 cells to replenish their numbers;3. to reduce HIV-related illnesses and deaths and4. in the long run to improve the quality of life for people living with AIDS.In order to understand how ARV's work we need to know about the lifecycle of the HI Virus.HIV infects cells of the immune system and turns the cells into virus factories: one virus can create millions more of itself, using our own cells for this purpose.The cells that HIV targets are called CD4 cells, which form an important part of the immune system.Once HIV enters these cells it goes through several steps before new HI viruses are produced.Each type of ARV works at a different step of the HIV lifecycle.You medical doctor or health care worker can explain to you in more detail how this works.In order for ARV treatment to be effective for a long time there is a need to take more than one ARV at a time.This is known as combination therapy and refers to the use of a combination of ARV drugs in treating HIV infection.For ARV's to be effective, they need to be taken strictly according to your medical doctor's instructions.ARV's can cause side effects such as diarrhoea, tiredness and headaches etc., even if they are taken correctly.This does not mean that the drugs are not working.If you happen to experience some of these side effects, you will need to discuss it with your doctor who will help to manage the side-effects.Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your treatment.You will not start ARV treatment immediately once you have been diagnosed HIV positive.ARV treatment will start once your CD4 count is below 200 and/or once you have an AIDS defining illness.In addition you will need to receive special counselling to prepare you for the ARV treatment before you start taking the drugs.ARV's will not get the HI virus out of your body.However, the benefits of taking ARV's include the fact that the functioning of your immune system will be restored and protected; the production of the virus will be able to be controlled; your health will improve and ultimately your life will be prolonged.ARV treatment is a complex process and it is advised that you discuss all your options with your doctor and counsellor who will be able to help you and support you during your treatment.Unlike most medications ARV's need to be taken strictly as prescribed, under medical supervision, for the rest of your life.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Why Do Black Women in South Africa Seem To Be More Vulnerable To HIV Infection Than Anyone Else?Why Do Black Women in South Africa Seem To Be More Vulnerable To HIV Infection Than Anyone Else?Question: Why do black women in South Africa seem to be more vulnerable to HIV infection than anyone else?Answer: Statistics show that black people have a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.Sub - Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence in the world.People most infected and at risk are those within the economically active population.It would also seem that black women between the ages of 15-49 years who are of child bearing age, are at the highest risk of infection.This poses the question as to why it is that black people are the most affected and as the statistics show, the most infected of all population groups?The history of unequal distribution of wealth in South Africa, during the times of apartheid which deprived black people of basic human rights i.e.. education, housing, jobs and access to health, may be associated with the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.The socio-economic status of black people makes them vulnerable to infections like TB, sexually transmitted infections (STI's), and HIV/AIDS.Especially vulnerable are those who live in informal settlements as they are most likely to be poor and unemployed.They live in conditions characterised by poor infrastructure, i.e.. with no sanitation, no clean running water, or electricity in place.Overcrowding and in some areas, no ventilation promotes disease.Within the black communities the status of women is low, which makes them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, as they often feel the loss of power to negotiate safer sex (the use of condoms) with their partners, due to a strong cultural belief that a man is the initiator around sexual matters.Furthermore, their financial dependency on their partners makes them vulnerable.Women living in rural areas and those working on the farms are even more vulnerable to sexually transmissible infections including HIV/AIDS, as access to health care facilities is difficult because services are minimal.In some situations such resources are non-existent.Added to these circumstances, women are deprived of finances.In other situations the fear of stigma may result in women not disclosing the fact that they are HIV positive.In addition, biological factors increase a woman's vulnerability due to undetected STI's and the fact that sexual fluid remains within her body for two or three days and can enter the blood stream if there are any lesions due to STI's or forceful intercourse.Movement of people seeking a better life, from one area to another, (migrant labour) makes them vulnerable to HIV as they are away from their families for long periods of time.In the case of men who, through their working situations, stay away from their wives/ families for prolonged periods of time, they may start other relationships where they often fail to practice safer sex.This further exposes both men and women to HIV/AIDS.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt Can One Get Infected with HIV From Social Contact?Can One Get Infected with HIV From Social Contact?Question: Can one get infected with HIV from hugging a person with HIV/AIDS, sharing eating utensils, sharing bath towels, using public toilets, a dog bite, a mosquito bite or working with a person with HIV/AIDS?Answer: No.Any social contact with an HIV infected person holds no risk of infection with HIV/AIDS for uninfected persons.Although HIV has been identified in body fluids eg: saliva and urine, no scientific evidence exists to show that these fluids cause transmission of HIV.There is no known risk of transmission from sweat, tears, respiratory droplets, swimming pool water, communal bath water, food or drinking water.Data has been collected from over 16 000 people with HIV/AIDS over 4 years with family members and health care workers who cared for them.To date, none have been infected with HIV from this daily social contact.It usually requires unprotected, penetrative sexual contact or broken skin for this to happen.Intact skin remains the best defense against the virus.Casual contact:HIV is not spread by casual contactHIV cannot live in the air, water or foodHIV is weak - it only lives in body fluidsHIV only spreads if the body fluid of a person with HIV gets into the blood stream of another personThis is why shaking hands with people with HIV does not spread the virus.If this was not true many more people would have HIV.Doctors, nurses, teachers, classmates, co-workers, friends and family all touch people with HIV and do not get the virus unless they have unprotected sex or share needles with them.People with HIV can cook food for others without any risk of passing the infection.The virus is not spread by doorknobs, typewriters, telephones or anything else that can be touched by someone with HIV or eating food prepared by someone with HIV.No one has ever been infected by sharing cigarettes, being sneezed on or spat on by someone with HIV.Measles and chicken pox is spread through the air but HIV is not air or vector borne (carried by insects such as mosquitoes or fleas).Colds or flu can be serious for someone with HIV/AIDS.Never allow anyone with chicken pox or measles to enter the room where one living with HIV/AIDS is being nursed when ill .HIV and Alcohol and Drug AbuseAlcohol or drug abuse influences one's decision making ability and makes it more likely that a person will not think clearly and will be more likely to do things that put them at risk of getting HIV, such as sharing needles or practicing unprotected sex.Home > Publications > Public Information > I > Frequently Asked Questions about HIV and AIDS &gt What Evidence Is there that Good Nutrition Consistently Improves The Immune Response?What Evidence Is there that Good Nutrition Consistently Improves The Immune Response?Question: I wish to enquire about the diet "prescribed or recommended" by the health minister which has made media headlines recently.I am confused by the conflicting reports about the effects and the lasting benefits of this diet on people living with HIV and AIDS that have been circulated.We have been told through the media that this should be our "informed choice" of treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS, as opposed to antiretrovirals.What evidence is there that any of these foods consistently improve the immune response?Were human studies carried out?How effective is a diet of blended or grated lemon, mixed with extra virgin olive oil and water, crushed garlic and ginger, spinach, beetroot and vitamin supplements?Answer: Where human studies have been carried out, the results around dietary programmes as medicinal alternatives are still contradictory and inconclusive.¹ The scientific community advocates good nutrition and ARVs.What does the literature say about these foods?Fresh garlic has excellent anti-fungal, antiviral and anti-bacterial properties; it also purportedly balances blood pressure and lowers cholesterol.Although some literature states that garlic is safe if taken in large quantities.²Scientific sources advise that garlic powder can damage the gastric mucosa and that garlic supplements, taken for over 2 months, may lengthen bleeding time (interfere with clotting) and interact with ARVs.³Like garlic, onions also help to fight infection.In one study however, onions and olive oil also failed to show any improvement to the immune system of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHAs), and in fact seemed hasten the onset to AIDS.The literature states that large amounts of ingested onions may cause chronic diarrhoea and intestinal distension.³ Onions as well as the African Potato previously advocated for, appear to have been omitted from the diet listed in your question.The African Potato (Hypoxis) had mixed success.Initial studies undertaken showed promising results with PLWHAs not progressing to AIDS.In a study on the safety and efficacy of Hypoxis, the majority of patients developed serious bone marrow suppression and the study had to be stopped after 8 weeks. ³Drinking lemon juice (2Tsp) and olive oil (1Tsp) mixed with water, once a day, reportedly increases appetite and energy levels and reduces swollen lymph glands. ²Most sources recommend a good multivitamin especially if you cannot eat enough food for your body's needs, due to nausea or diarrhoea.A balanced diet - fruit and vegetables (including beetroot, spinach and ginger), nuts and seeds, grains, seafoods, meat, poultry and dairy products - is still the best source of vitamins and minerals, however.Please ensure that meat and fish are thoroughly cooked before being eaten by PLWHAs.Most foods have beneficial properties, but immune-boosting foodstuffs, vitamins and supplements, if taken in large quantities, may have an adverse effect even in a completely healthy person.The immune system of a person with HIV is running amok, and the effects may be even more unexpected.Some nutrients boost the immune system as well as enhance the replication of HIV in the body.Supplements can also interfere with ARVs and it is absolutely imperative to inform your health care team of any medication, herbal medicines, homeopathic remedies, or other substances you are taking.While the CD4 cell count is only an indication of the body's immune system, the report of the CD4 cell counts improving in 2 subjects on the above diet may have given a false impression.The CD4 cell count may fluctuate by up to 80 points on either side of the count due to influences like the time of day, the previous meal, an infection or a mood shift.In both of the subjects the new CD4 cell count had improved by less than 80 points.It is perhaps best to exercise caution, and try to find the most balanced way, and one that suits your needs, to deal with this disease.It is important to ensure that all food prepared for PLWHAs is hygienically handled to prevent infections.¹ Nutrition Information Centre, University of Stellenbosch (NICUS), 2003², Positive Health by Neil M.

Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the ChildMaintenance is in the Best Interests of the ChildEvery child has the right to basic necessities such as:1. food2. shelter3. clothing4. medical care5. schoolingChildren should get these basic needs from their parents or relatives.Parents or relatives maintain children directly, when the child lives with them.Parents or relatives maintain children indirectly, when the child lives with someone else, by paying maintenance, or money to support the child and provide his or her basic needs.CONTENTS: You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the ChildHome > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Who Has a Duty to Maintain?Who Has a Duty to Maintain?The law requires a child to be supported or maintained by:1. his or her parents, whether married, living together, separated or divorced, including parents who have adopted the child; and2. his or her grandparents, if the child's parents were married to each other.3. This legal duty is called "the duty to maintain" or "the duty to support".Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What Is the Maintenance System?What Is the Maintenance System?Where parents separate, many parents voluntary pay maintenance to the parent living with the child.Other parents fail to honour their legal duty to maintain their child.The maintenance system is the system of courts which ensures that parents honour their duty to maintain their children.A maintenance court can order a parent who does not live with his or her child to pay maintenance for the support of his or her child.The maintenance system therefore ensures that parents not living with their children make a fair financial contribution towards the support of their children.Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Must I Still Pay Maintenance if ... ?Must I Still Pay Maintenance if ... ?Must I still pay maintenance if the other parent:* remarries?* is involved in another relationship?* does not let me see the children?Your children's right to their basic needs has nothing to do with your view of the other parent's behaviour.Your children still need maintenance, and you must still pay maintenance, even if the other parent remarries or gets involved in another relationship.Again, your children are still entitled to maintenance even if you cannot see them.Your duty to maintain them is totally separate from their right to see you.Your duty to pay does not depend on whether or not you can see them.Home > Publications > Public Information > J > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt How Is the Amount of Maintenance Calculated?How Is the Amount of Maintenance Calculated?The maintenance court or the maintenance officer at court will help in working out how much money should be paid as maintenance.Usually, the court first works out how much the children need for their maintenance (ie., to provide them with food, shelter, clothes, and so on).The court will then see that each parent makes a fair contribution to those needs, usually by requiring them to contribute in proportion to their respective incomes.Home > Publications > Public

individual earns taxable income that is not subject to SITE or PAYE deductions , he or she has to pay provisional tax on this income.Provisional tax payments are made on a six-monthly basis.Provisional tax is intended to help taxpayers meet their tax liabilities on an on-going basis as opposed to paying a big amount once a year on assessment.The provisional tax paid will be offset against the final tax liability that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assessment.A person who becomes liable for the payment of provisional tax must, within 30 days of becoming liable, apply in writing for registration at the local branch office of the South African Revenue Service .Failure to do so will result in interest and penalties being levied on late payments and additional tax for the late submission of returns.The due date for the payment of provisional tax for the first period is within six months from the start of the year of assessment.The first provisional tax payment must represent half of the tax liability for the full tax year.Calculate provisional tax as follows for the first period:half of the total tax for the full yearless the employees tax deducted for this periodless any allowable foreign tax credits for this period .Make payments on the prescribed IRP6 return's payment advice, on or before the due dates for payment.SARS will send registered provisional taxpayers the appropriate forms.The following methods to effect payments to SARS are available:provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidayswhere payments are made by mail, via the bank or ATM, sufficient time for mailing or processing must be taken into accountwhere payments are done electronically, provision must be made for your bank's cut-off times and for a clearance period that could take between two and five days.Banking details:Clients paying over the counter at any ABSA, FNB, or Nedbank branch will no longer need to supply a bank account number and bank code when making payments.This applies equally to all ABSA, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank internet banking clients.All that will be required is:the client's 19-digit payment reference number; andthe beneficiary ID / account number which is linked to a specific type of tax to make payments.These details are reflected on the payment advice of the IRP 6 return.Payments that do not comply with both the above-mentioned payment reference number and the beneficiary ID will not be accepted.If the last day for payment falls on a public holiday or weekend, the payment must be made on the last working day prior to the public holiday or weekend.For more details refer to the SARS website www.sars.gov.zaIf the first provisional tax payment is based on an estimated taxable income that is less than the basic amount, a request and motivation should be included.The IRP 6 return for the first period now includes a space where you must motivate such a request.If SARS is not satisfied, a revised estimate may be requested.To avoid penalties and interest, make sure that IRP 6 returns are submitted to the relevant SARS branch office well before the due date for payment.This will ensure that your request is received and processed in time.The payment advice portion of the IRP 6 return is now on a separate page.Your return can therefore be submitted separately from your payment.Consult the IRP 12 Guidelines if you require assistance in the completion of your IRP 6 return.Income Tax Act, 1962 – Fourth ScheduleWhen you submit your returns SARS aims to:process and assess 80% of correctly completed and signed income tax returns within 90 working days from date of receipt during peak periods and within 34 working days of receipt in off-peak periodsprocess VAT and PAYE returns within 20 working days of receiptprocess 90% of all electronically submitted export and import returns within 4 hours of receipt and within 24 hours of receipt of manual submissions.Note: If a representative is dealing with your tax affairs, ensure that SARS is informed of the fact.This is to protect you and to ensure that SARS does not compromise your privacy and confidentiality.Return for the first provisional tax payment IndividualReturn for the first provisional tax payment TrustReturn for the first provisional tax payment Company or close corporationSARS will send the forms to registered provisional taxpayers.The payment advice is in each case attached to the IRP 6 return.Return for the second provisional tax paymentA person who becomes liable for the payment of provisional tax must, within 30 days of becoming liable, apply in writing for registration at the local branch office of the South African Receiver of Revenue .The due date for payment of the second provisional tax period is not later than the last day of the year of assessment or approved financial year-end date.Note:Where a February financial year-end creates financial hardship and approval has been obtained from SARS to submit financial statements to a date other than the end of February, such persons may also request approval to submit provisional tax returns in line with the approved financial year-end.All other income however remains in the year of assessment ending 28/29 February.Calculate provisional tax as follows as follows for the second period:the total estimated tax for the full yearless the employees tax paid for the full yearless the any allowable foreign tax credits for the full yearless the amount paid for the first period.the beneficiary ID / account number which is linked to a specific type of tax to make paymentsthese details are reflected on the payment advice of the IRP 6 returnpayments that do not comply with both the above-mentioned payment reference number and the beneficiary ID will not be accepted.IRP 6 returns for second period must be submitted even if, according to your calculation, no provisional tax is payable.The second provisional tax payment should be based on an estimated taxable income which is equal to the basic amount or an amount based on your actual taxable income for that year.This will ensure that your request is received and processed in time and you will not have to pay penalties and interest.The payment advice portion of the IRP6 return is now on a separate page.You can therefore submit your return separately from your payment.Consult the IRP 12 Guidelines if you require assistance in the completion of your IRP6 return.Income Tax Act, 1962 — Fourth ScheduleIf a representative is dealing with your tax affairs, it is vital that you ensure that SARS is informed thereof.Return for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: IndividualReturn for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: TrustReturn for the second provisional tax payment, IRP6: Company or close corporationThe payment advice is attached to the IRP 6 return.﻿People's Housing Process DescriptionThe process allows beneficiaries to establish a housing support organisation that will provide them with organisational, technical and administrative assistance.The assistance includes training and guidance to the beneficiaries to build their own homes.This option is available on a project basis to beneficiaries, via consolidation, institutional and project-linked subsidies.In addition, it is available in rural areas where people only have functional tenure rights to the land that they occupy.How does the People's Housing Process work?The process allows you to use a subsidy to build your own house.Since technical assistance and support in this process are critical, everyone participating in the process needs to have a support organisation.This organisation provides the technical support to ensure that the house is built properly.People who build their own houses themselves or who organise the building of their houses can build bigger houses for less money.The People's Housing Process allows you to:save on labour costs by doing some of the building work yourself or by getting assistance from your family, neighbours, friends and others to help youavoid having to pay a profit element to developers, andoptimise your decisions.To qualify for this process, you must:Be a lawful resident in South AfricaHave a gross monthly household income of less than R3 500Not have received a subsidy from the Government to buy a house previously.Be a first-time property owner.Note that you have to enter into a contract with a support organisation which is a legal entity.The support organisation will provide you with technical and administrative assistance.contact the Provincial Department of Housingsupply identity documents of yourself, spouse and childrensupply a copy of your salary advice or proof of earnings.The applications are processed by the Provincial Departments of Housing.The time frame to deliver this service varies from one case to the next.There is no application form.How to become a Police reservistAny person

learner is of compulsory school-going age, the Head of Education has to make arrangements to place him or her in another public school.* Alternatives to Corporal Punishment (Public Information) (File

ImmunisationQuestions and Answers about Measles & Polio ImmunisationThis publication provides information for parents around measles and polio vaccinations.Stop Polio!Stop Measles!Immunise!MEASLESWhat is Measles?Measles is the most dangerous of all childhood diseases.The first sign is a high fever followed by a blotchy red rash all over the body.It is also accompanied by cough, a runny nose and red eyes.Measles can cause dangerous complications, such as infection of the lungs, blindness and death.What causes measles?Measles is caused by a very small germ called the measles virus.It cannot by seen with the naked eye.It is spread when a child with measles coughs or sneezes.Children who suffered from measles cannot get it a second time.Most children who have been immunised against measles at the right age will not get measles.Why is measles a dangerous disease?Young children, who survive measles are weakened by the disease and may later die from malnutrition or other illnesses.Measles is also an important cause of mental retardation and blindness.A quarter of all deaths from measles occur before the age of one year.Measles in older children usually occur as outbreaks, when large groups of children get measles at the same time.The risk of a measles outbreak is higher when groups of children gather together for example in crèches day care centres and at schools.Is it important to immunise children during the measles campaign?Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the EXTRA measles injection during the campaign.Children who miss the immunisation campaign might not be fully protected against the measles virus.I heard that the parents or guardians of children must sign a consent form before a child can receive the extra measles immunisation.Is it true?If a child is to be immunised at a school or crèche where the parent is not present when the immunisation is given, a consent form will be given to parents or guardians of children in crèches, day care centres and at schools in advance.It provides and opportunity to inform parents or guardians about the extra measles injection.In this case, if you agree to this immunisation, please complete and sign the form and send it back to the school or crèche.Your child will then receive the immunisation if consent forms are signed and returned on time!If you bring the child to an immunisation centre during the campaign, it is not necessary for you to fill in a consent form.POLIOWhat is Polio?Polio is a crippling disease.It is caused by a very small germ called the polio virus.Polio can lead to permanent lameness, deformity and even death.Due to routine immunisations in childhood, polio has not been seen in South Africa since 1989.However, there have been outbreaks of polio in neighbouring countries.How will I recognize polio in a child?Polio can be suspected when there is sudden weakness of the leg or arm or both or other parts of the body.This weakness should not have been present at birth.If the person was injured just before the weakness of the person has a history of being mentally retarded, then polio is not likely to be the cause of the weakness.Please report any sudden weakness/paralysis in a child under 15 years (not caused by injury), to the nearest clinic, hospital or doctor for investigation.It could be polio!Why do we have special campaigns to immunise against polio?To give TWO extra polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.This prevents the polio virus from circulating among children.South Africa is taking part in an effort to eradicate polio worldwide.It means that the virus will be wiped out completely from the face of the earth,.Once the polio virus does not exist any more, children will no longer need to receive polio immunisation.Is it important to immunise children during the first and second round of the polio campaign?Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the first AND the second round of the polio campaign - even if the child is up to date with the routine immunisations.To protect children against the polio virus, polio drops need to be given TWICE.Children who miss the second round will not be fully protected against the polio virus.Nationwide, starting dates for the campaigns in 2004 will be 26 July (measles and polio); and 30 August (polio only).The duration of the campaigns will differ from province to province.Why do we have Measles and Polio Immunisation campaigns?To give extra measles and polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.This prevents the measles and polio virus from circulating among children.Why is the extra measles and polio immunisation for certain age groups only?The children aged under 5 years are the group of children who most often become ill with measles and polio and spread the virus.Is the extra measles and polio immunisation only for children who missed their routine immunisations?No!All children aged between 0 months to under 5 years must receive the EXTRA campaign immunisations.Where must I go to make sure that my child does not miss the extra immunisations?Talk to your clinic nurse, community leaders and employers about the campaign.Look out for immunisation posters and radio announcements that will indicate the way to the nearest immunisation post.Special efforts will be made to bring immunisation posts as close to your home as possible during the campaign.You can also go to your nearest clinic.Immunisation teams will visit day care centres, crèches and schools during the campaign.Must I bring my child's immunisation card?Yes, please bring it along.It is always important to take the child's and your own immunisation card with you when you go to a clinic or doctor.Cards may be checked during one of the rounds to see if a child needs routine immunisations.But even if your child has lost his/her card or has never had a card, please still bring your child to be immunised.What will I find at the immunisation post?You will be asked if the child is in the age group.While holding your child, 2 drops will be given to the child and it will be given again if your child spits it out.The extra measles injection will be given to children from 9 months to under 5 years of age, on the same day with the polio drops.Can a sick child get immunisations?Yes, all children can be given the immunisations even if they have fever, cough, diarrhoea, malnutrition or any other illness.If you would like to help eliminate measles and eradicate polio out of South Africa, here is how you can assist or become involved.* Contact your nearest clinic and speak to them.A clinic nurse will be in charge at the immunisation post during the campaign.Tasks will be delegated to VOLUNTEERS.* Tell everybody about the campaign and to bring all the children.The measles and polio immunisation campaigns are opportunities to contribute to the well being of your children and their future!* Mass Polio and Measles Immunisation Campaign for all Children under 5

Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is Credit?What Is Credit?Credit refers to an arrangement where you buy goods and pay for them after you have taken possession of them.Often you pay off the item in instalments over a period of time.Examples of credit include:* accounts at shops (for example, an account at a clothing store)* accounts at professional service providers (for example, an account at the doctor)* lease agreements or instalment sale agreements (for example, where you agree to pay for an item over a period of time, like at a furniture store – these used to be called hire-purchase agreements).You can also get credit from a bank or a micro-lender.In this case, you are given a cash loan.You are required to pay back the loan over an agreed period of time.You are also required to pay interest on the loan.It is important to note that, when you buy on credit, you are likely to pay more than if you paid for the goods in cash.To make sure that you know how much you will actually pay if you buy on credit find out:* the cash price and the extra costs* what the total amount will be* how much the deposit is* what the monthly payments will be* how long you can take to pay off the amount.CONTENTS: Credit and LoansHome > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Agreement?What Is a Credit Agreement?When you buy something on credit, you will have to sign a credit agreement.This is a legal contract and must include the following information:* The names and addresses of the buyer and seller.* A description of the goods.* The cash price and the other charges (finance charges, insurance and so on) that make up the total price the buyer must pay.The rate of interest applicable must also be included.* The deposit that must be paid (a deposit must be paid).* The amount of each instalment, including the last instalment, and the day of the week or month by which it must be paid.* A note informing the buyer that the seller continues to own the goods until the full price has been paid.You must be given a copy of the credit agreement.You should keep this document in a safe place.Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What is Micro-Finance?What is Micro-Finance?Micro finance is a broad term used to describe money lending on a small scale.Registered LendersMicro-lenders are encouraged to register with the Micro Finance Regulatory Council (MFRC).The MFRC is an independent, non-profit organisation that has been empowered by government to regulate the micro-lending industry and protect the interests of consumers.All lenders registered with the MFRC should have a registration certificate displayed at their business.Micro-lenders registered with the MFRC operate under different rules to lenders who are not registered.Most importantly, they qualify for the exemption in terms of the Usury Act which means they may charge you any interest rate.For services, advice and information, visit the MFRC website.Information includes details on:* rights* unfair practices* registered lenders* complaints.You can also contact them atToll-share: 0860 100 406info@mfrc.co.za or complaints@mfrc.co.zaUnregistered LendersMicro-lenders who are not registered with the MFRC, are regulated by the Usury Act.This Act prevents lenders from charging excessive interest rates.These rates vary from time to time and the rate applicable depends on the date the loan agreement was entered into.Currently, these lenders cannot charge interest of more than 23% per year on a loan of less than R10,000, and cannot charge interest of more than 20% per year on a loan of more than R10,000 .Unregistered lenders are controlled by the Department of Trade and Industry and can lend you an amount of up to R50,000.Your agreement will set out how long you have to pay back the loan.You can only cancel a contract with an unregistered lender if you and the lender agreed to this before you signed the contract.If you want to complain about an unregistered lender, you can contact the National Inspectorate of Consumer Affairs at 011 355 8008.Tips* You have three days in which to cancel a micro-loan agreement with a registered micro-lender, if you change your mind.* Get a written contract setting out all costs and charges.* Lenders must use legal mechanisms for collecting loans.The lender is not allowed to:* ask to keep your bank card* ask for your bank card number (PIN number)* ask you to leave your ID book with him* ask you to leave a grant payment card* ask you to sign blank documents or documents with blank spaces* use violent means to collect the money owed.* No lender should charge an up-front fee with the application, in other words, a fee when you sign the agreement.* Do not sign a ‘Consent to judgement’ when you take a loan.* You have a right to ask for a statement at any time showing how much you have paid and how much you still owe.* You must also receive your copy of the contract within 14 days of signing it.Grants and Micro-LendingYou cannot use a social grant (for example a pension or child care grant) as surety for a loan.Lenders are not allowed to hold onto your grants payment card, as security for a loan.If you are a recipient of a social grant, you will be required to sign a declaration saying that you will keep your grants payment card (also called an Allpay Card) safe and will not give it to a micro lender.Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Profile?What Is a Credit Profile?Your credit profile contains your personal details, where and how many times you've applied for credit, as well as information on your paying habits.Whenever you apply for credit, the creditor will check your profile and decide whether to give you credit based on the information they receive from the credit bureau.If you have a bad credit history, it impacts on your credit profile for years to come.Different credit problems are kept on record for different lengths of time:* liquidations & sequestrations - ten years* court judgments against you - five years* negative records (eg unpaid accounts) - three years* collection records and administration orders - until the debt is settled.When you apply for credit, the creditor will check your credit rating with the credit bureau, and if you have a bad credit history, they will refuse to give you credit.This is referred to as "black listing".You can get your credit profiles from the major credit bureaus for a fee (the fees depend on the information you are requesting).The credit bureau will be able to answer your questions about your credit rating, and whether there is anything you can do to improve your rating.There are two major credit bureaux in South Africa:ITCTel: 021 401 4200www.transunionitc.co.zaExperianTel: 011 463-3930 / 6070www.experian.co.zaIf you do not get the information you require, or are not satisfied, you can contact:The Credit Bureau AssociationPO Box 57039, Arcadia, 0007Tel: 0861 66 28 37Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?If you buy on credit, the creditor usually remains the owner of the things you have bought until you have finished paying all the instalments.This means that if you can't pay your monthly instalments, the creditor can repossess the items in question.Unless the creditor has a court order, they can only repossess the item if they have your permission (this is called "voluntary surrender").If the creditor wants to force you to return the items, then they will need a court order.Before they can get this order, the creditor must send a registered letter to you warning you that the payments are overdue and that the outstanding amount must be paid within 30 days.If you have previously fallen behind in your payments and received a letter of demand, and you fall behind again, the creditor will send a letter of demand giving you 14 days to pay the outstanding instalments.If you still do not pay, then the seller can get a court order to repossess the goods.If you are presented with a court summons, you will have to enter a written plea at the court, or file an opposing affidavit, explaining why you have not paid the amount (for example, the creditor may be claiming more from you than you actually owe).Matters are usually settled without a trial, but if the matter is not settled and you want to go to court to defend yourself, you need to file a Notice of Intention to Defend.If the matter goes to trial and you do not defend yourself or if the court thinks that you are not justified, the court can issue an order allowing the creditor to reclaim the goods.The Sheriff of the court is responsible for repossessing the goods.This official will show you the court order and can then take the goods away.If the sheriff has a court order, then you (or anyone else staying in the house at the time) must allow them into the house to take the goods away.Sometimes, the creditor will not want the goods back and will issue a summons against you to get the money back.In this case, the creditor will have to explain why they can't reclaim the goods.Will the instalments you have already paid be refunded if the goods are repossessed?The value of the goods is likely to have diminished since you first bought them because they are no longer brand new.Depending on the value of the repossessed goods, you may get a refund (if the value of the goods plus the amount you have already paid is more than what you originally owed, then you will be paid the difference).But if the goods are worth less then the amount that you still owe, then you will still owe the creditor money.If someone (like a debt recovery agent) has been sent to claim a debt from you and has behaved inappropriately, you can lodge a complaint with the Council for Debt Collectors (all debt collectors must be registered with the council).The Council for Debt Collectors’ contact details:PO Box/Posbus 836, Silverton, Pretoria, 0127West Wing - Ground Floor, Rentmeester Park, 74 Watermeyer Street , Val de Grace, PretoriaFax:

Tourism > Publications > Public Information > L &gt Laws and Policies Affecting Small BusinessHome > Publications > Public Information > M &gt Employ People with DisabilitiesEmploy People with DisabilitiesAUTHOR: Chief Directorate of Communications for the Directorate of Equal OpportunitiesThis publication provides information about employment of people with disabilities to employers and employees."It's time to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity"* Aim of the Code* Definition of "People with Disabilities"* Reasonable Accommodate the Needs of People with Disabilities* Recruitment and Selection of People with Disabilities* Medical and Psychological Testing* Training and Career Advancement* Retaining People with Disabilities* Compensation for with Disabilities* Confidentiality* Benefits for Staff Members* Employment Equity Planning* Education and Awareness* InformationMany barriers such as widespread ignorance, fear and stereotypes have caused people with disabilities to be unfairly discriminated against in society and in employment.For these reasons they are a designated group in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.The Minister of Labour has therefore approved a Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.AIM OF THE CODEThe Code is a guide for employers and workers to encourage equal opportunities and fair treatment of people with disabilities as required by the Act.The Code is intended to educate and inform employers and workers to understand their rights and obligations to promote certainty and to reduce disputes so that people with disabilities can effectively enjoy and exercise their rights at work.The Code is intended to help create awareness of the contributions people with disabilities can make and to encourage employers to fully use the skills of such people.DEFINITION OF "PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES"In terms of the Act the focus is on the effect of a disability on the person in relation to the working environment, and not on the diagnosis or the impairment.People are considered as "People with Disabilities" who satisfy all the criteria in the definition:* having a physical or mental impairment* which is long term or recurring, and* which substantially limits their prospects of entry into or advancement in employment.REASONABLY ACCOMODATE THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIESEmployers should adopt the most cost-effective mean that is consistent with effectively removing the barriers to perform the job, and to enjoy equal access to the benefits and opportunities of employment.Reasonable accommodation applies to applicants and staff members with disabilities who are suitably qualified for the job and may be required:* during the recruitment and selection process* in the working environment* in the way work is usually done, evaluated and rewarded* in the benefits and privileges of employment.RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIESEmployers should make job advertisements accessible to people with disabilities by identifying the inherent requirements of the post, clearly describing the skills and capabilities required and setting reasonable criteria for selection.MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTINGTests should comply with the requirements of the Act and must be relevant and appropriate to the work for which the person is being tested.Employers should ensure that tests do not unfairly exclude conditions and should not be biased on how or when they are applied, assessed or interpreted.Testing to determine the health status of a person should only be carried out after the employer has established that the person is in fact competent to perform the essential job functions or duties and after a job offer has been made.TRAINING AND CAREER ADVANCEMENTPeople with disabilities should be consulted on their career advancement and possible needs and so facilities and materials for training should be accessible to them.Evaluation of work performance should clearly identify and fairly measure and reward performance of the essential functions of the job.RETAINING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIESWorkers who become disabled during employment should, where reasonably possible, be re-integrated into the work force.IF reasonable, employers should explore the possibility of offering alternative work, reduced work or flexible work placement, so that workers are not compelled or encouraged to terminate their employment.COMPENSATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIESWhen workers become disabled because of work related illnesses or accidents, the employer should assist that worker to receive the relevant assistance in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injures and Diseases Act from the Compensation Fund and to receive the appropriate benefits in terms of the Unemployment Insurance Act.CONFIDENTIALITYEmployers must protect the confidentiality of information that has been disclosed by a worker or job applicant with a disability.They must take care to keep records of private information relating to the disability confidential and separate from general personal records.Employers may not disclose any information relating to a person's disability without the written consent of the person concerned, unless required to do so by law.BENEFITS FOR STAFF MEMBERSEmployers who provide or arrange for occupational insurance or other benefit plans for workers must ensure that the benefits do not unfairly discriminate, either directly or indirectly against people with disabilities.EMPLOYMENT EQUITY PLANNINGIf people with disabilities are under-represented in all occupational levels and categories in the workplace, the employer should seek guidance from organisations that represent people with disabilities or relevant experts, for example in vocational rehabilitation and occupational therapy to bring those vacancies to the attention of possible work seekers with disabilities.EDUCATION AND AWARENESSEmployers, employer organisations and trade unions should include the Code in orientation, education and training programmes of workers.For more information consult the Employment Equity Act, 1998 and the Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities on the website of the Department of Labour at www.labour.gov.za or contact the CCMA helpline at 0861 161616 or the nearest office of the Department of Labour.Home > Publications > Public Information > M &gt HIV/Aids:

Information > P > Places of Slave Rememberance in the Western Cape &gt Cape Town and SurroundsCape Town and SurroundsThe city was once bursting with slaves - they were artisans, builders, coopers, bakers, cleaners, fruit and fish vendors, water carriers, grave-diggers, potters, wood collectors, gardeners and wetnurses.An estimated 63 000 slaves were imported between the mid-17th century and the early 19th century from Indonesia, India, Ceylon, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Angola and Mozambique.Find out more about these places of interest:The ParadeThe Slave LodgeSlave Tree PlaqueJustitie

is where slaves were first housed.The Slave Lodge (49 Adderley Street) In 1679 a windowless, brick structure was built to house the slaves of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC).The building's dilapidated and filthy state was reported throughout the 18th century.Besides serving as a labour force for the Company, slaves also worked in the adjacent gardens, as well as in the hospital opposite the lodge.Tel: 021 460 8242The Slave Tree PlaqueThe Slave Tree plaque (Spin Street) This commemorative plaque on the centre island marks the site where the Slave Tree - the place where slaves were auctioned - once stood.Justitie plaats and Whipping Post The south-western corner of Darling and Buitenkant Streets was once a place of torture and execution.There was a post to which slaves and convicted persons were tied while receiving corporal punishment.The Company's Garden One of the many gardens worked by Company slaves is at the top of Adderley Street.The others were at Rustenburg, Groote Schuur, Newlands, Fish Hoek and Simon's Town.By 1782 almost two thirds of the inhabitants of the outposts (of which the gardens formed a part) were slaves.There is a symbolic slave bell (not from this period) in the Company's Garden.Bells like this were used on farms to call slaves to work.The Company GardensGreen Market SquareSlave Pricing AuctionGreenmarket Square and the Old Town House Fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables grown in the gardens of Table Valley, as well as produce brought in by farmers from the outlying districts, were sold here by slaves earning their "coolie money" (derogatory term used for slave earnings).The slaves used a tavern next to the Old Town House for drinking and gambling.There was also a fountain on the square from which slaves fetched water.Year25 - 33,316621001674167730 concessionary price169750 - 133171260 - 90176860 - 3331783100 - 730Important notices and proclamations were read from the

Street) The official residence of the Premier of the Western Cape has an outbuilding dating back to the 18th century that was used as a slave lodge.Other residences in upper Table Valley also had lodges to house the slaves who worked their commercial gardens, although none of these lodges have survived.Leeuwenhof's slave lodge now houses an exhibition on the history of the estate, which is open to the public by appointment.Tel: 021 483 4705Platteklip stream on Table Mountain This is where household slaves came to do the laundry.Old Slave Church, SA Mission Museum (40 Long Street) The South African Missionary Society, an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, was founded in 1799 by Reverend Vos of Tulbagh to spread Christianity to slaves.This architecturally unique church was built in 1804.Today it is a museum depicting the history of South African Christian mission work.Other mission and post-emancipation sites with slave connections are St Stephen's Church in Riebeeck Square, the church in Chapel Street and the Berlin Mission in Searle Street, District Six.Many ex-slave baptisms and marriages also took place in the Lutheran Church in Strand Street.On 1 December 1838, the day of the emancipation, a service of thanksgiving took place at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Somerset Road).Until the ex-slave component of the congregation moved to St Stephen's Church (then the Old Theatre) they were accommodated at St Andrew's.Tel: 021 423 6755St Stephen's Church (Riebeeck Square) This building dates from 1801.It was originally a theatre open to all races but in 1829 slaves and free blacks were no longer allowed to attend.Ironically, this theatre was later used as a mission church for freed slaves.This caused a public outcry and the windows of the church were shattered by stone-throwing ex-theatre patrons.Because of this, the church was named after the martyr St Stephen, who was stoned to death.It is unusual in the Dutch Reformed Church to name a parish after a martyr.St Andrew's ChurchOld Slave ChurchAuwal Mosque (39 Dorp Street) The Muslim faith was brought to South Africa by slaves imported from the East.This mosque's history dates back to 1794.The property was owned by a freed slave, Salie Coridon of Ceylon.His daughter married Achmat of Bengal, who later inherited the property and subsequently made it available to the Muslim community to be used as a mosque.It is the oldest mosque in the country.Palm Tree Mosque (Long Street) It was built in the 1780s as a house with a prayer room upstairs and the Imam's residence downstairs.The Muslim congregation of the Palm Tree Mosque has an oral tradition which says that the house was given as a mosque to the Imam by his son-in-law, Jan Boekies.Unmarked graves (Somerset Road, Green Point) Slaves and paupers were buried in an unmarked burial ground at the lower end of Signal Hill (where the Green Point Traffic Department is today), as well as in the Coburn Street area.Bo-Kaap and Tana Baru cemetery The Bo-Kaap is inhabited mainly by descendants of slaves who were brought here by the VOC in the early days of the settlement.This area is characterised by narrow, cobblestone streets and mosques.Many of the flat-roofed houses date back to the 18th century.The Bo-Kaap Museum (71 Wale Street) is furnished as a 19th century Muslim home.Many slaves were Muslim and were buried above the Bo-Kaap.The burial ground has a magnificent view of the city.Tel: 021 481 39393Hurling Swinging Pump (Prins Street) There was no piped water in Cape Town and slaves

1692 he built a U-shaped house on the property.Constantia wines were well-known in the 18th century and competed with Madeira wine in Europe.Lady Ann Barnard watched wine being made here in 1798 by slaves "who were dancing in the wine press and beating the drum" and the slaves danced on them softly, the wine running out from a hole at the bottom of the barrel, this was done to slow music...".At Groot Constantia a few of the slaves were musicians.Today the house and outbuildings function as a museum containing furniture and porcelain from the VOC period.Slaves were housed in a building next to the Jonkershuis (a separate building near the main house).Anna de Koning, the daughter of a freed slave, inherited Groot Constantia from her husband, Oloff Bergh.She owned 27 slaves.Tel: 021 795 5140Old Residency, Simon's Town Museum (Court Road) The museum has close connections with a few of the local families in the area who have done genealogical research on their slave ancestors, many of whom were Muslims.Some families have kitaabs or diaries going back to slave times.In the basement of the former Residency there are cells where criminals and slaves were imprisoned.There is also a Muslim Heritage Museum in King George Way.Tel: 021 786 3046 or 021 786 2303Anna de KoningVergelegen (Lourensford Road, Somerset West) This is a working wine estate with an old house, outbuildings and a slave lodge.In about 1700 Willem Adriaan van der Stel erected an outbuilding that resembled a 17th century European hallehuis - a large three-aisled barn-like structure with a thatched roof reaching almost to the ground.The slave lodge housed up to 200 slaves at a time.The slaves at Vergelegen worked as cabinet-makers, tailors, cooks, masons and labourers.The lodge was excavated for the Anglo-American De Beers Chairman's Educational Trust in 1989.The remains of a slave woman were discovered under the floor of the site.She was re-buried on the farm in a marked grave, which can be visited.There is an interpretive centre on the farm where artefacts recovered during archaeological excavation are displayed.Tel: 021 847 1334Home > Publications > Public Information > P >

maintained public buildings and roads in the colony, who did the back-breaking work in the vineyards and orchards of Boland farms, who helped to build the imposing homesteads and who made furniture, vats, wagons, clothes and other forms of cultural material that we still see around us today.Slave sales were held on farms and auctions took place in Stellenbosch.Slaves were punished and executed in Stellenbosch in public, as well as in the Old Goal.Arson, one of the most frequent transgressions, was punishable by hanging.Places of slave remembrance in the WinelandsRhenish Mission

Zendelings Genoodschap in 1838.The society was concerned with the spiritual and educational needs of slaves.The first missionary and teacher was Meeuwes Janse Bakker and meetings were held at his house.Reverend Erasmus Smit took over in 1822.A church was built on a donated plot of ground and dedicated in 1824.After 1829 the Rhenish missionary Luckhoff worked among slaves on neighbouring farms and started evening schools for them.The congregation joined the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa in 1948 but kept the name of the Rhenish Dutch Reformed Mission Congregation.Row of slave houses in Herte Street The Rhenish Mission Church provided a row of houses for freed slaves in Herte Street.A painting of the family can still be seen hanging in Bletterman House.The long building on the corner of Plein and Ryneveld streets was originally the slave quarters of Bletterman House.From 1825 to 1833 it served as a school for slave children under Reverend Erasmus Smit and was equipped with 50 benches.Since boys and girls were taught separately, a wooden partition was installed between them.At first the school had 73 pupils, but by 1824 numbers had risen to 124 pupils.When the school closed, the children were accommodated at the Rhenish Mission Church.Slaves were also once housed in the western half of the cottage of Grosvenor House (today it is Collins Cottage).Tel: 021 887 2937Kromme Rivier (Paul Kruger Street) This estate was granted as a farm to Jan Jansz van Eeden in 1683.Many structures were erected on this farm during its history, including a 1730's building where slaves are presumed to have been housed.It was changed considerably over time and today it is a double-storeyed flat.The property belongs to the Roman Catholic Church and is known as St Nicholas Roman Catholic Priory.Bletterman HouseRev. Erasmus SmitElsenburg (on the R304) In 1752 Martin Melck became the owner of the farm.He was also one of the biggest slave owners at the Cape, having 200 slaves at his command.In his time the farmhouse, slave quarters, outbuildings and a school for slave children were erected.On smaller farms there were no special living quarters for slaves; they slept in kitchens, attics and barns, or out of doors in summer.A story exists about Moses of Bengal, a slave from Elsenburg who was sold to the owner of Loevenstein in Parow.He was mistreated by his new owner and ran back to Elsenburg where he set the slave lodge alight.His punishment was that he was burned alive.The old house, outbuildings and slave bell have survived and form part of the Elsenburg College of Agriculture campus.It is open to the public.Tel: 021 808 5008Melck and his wife's estate as listed in 1776FarmsSlaves203Horses170Cattle1321Sheep4167Pigs106Elsenburg Slave BellLanzerac (Jonkershoek Road) Lanzerac, originally known as Schoongezigt, was granted partly to free blacks Manuel and Anthony of Angola, and Louis of Bengal, in 1692.Interestingly, they also owned slaves.Other free blacks settled in what is today known as Jonkershoek.Thus, Oude Nektar (originally Jan Lui) was owned by the free slaves Manquard and Jan of Ceylon in 1692.Jan of Ceylon also owned other properties in Jonkershoek.Free blacks were people of slave descent or former slaves who had, for a variety of reasons, been freed by their owners.Tel: 021 887 1132Spier Wine Estate (R310 Baden Powell Drive) The historic Spier estate is a well-established part of the wine route.The property was granted to Arnoud Jansz in 1692 although he had lived there since 1683.Many structures were built on the property, including a slave house.The former slave quarters now houses a restaurant.There is a slave bell which was used to signal the start and end of the working day.Tel 021 809 1100Pniel (R310) The evangelisation of slaves and "heathens" in the Groot Drakenstein valley was started by a number of local Christian farmers.They provided land for religious activities in the area known as "Papieren Molen".After the emancipation of slaves, the land was extended to accommodate more residents.This mission station was founded in 1843 to look after the spiritual welfare of freed slaves.The churchyard had a church, a parsonage and a school.In Pniel there is an area know as Masbiekvlei or Mozambiquevlei where freed slaves originally from Mozambique lived with their descendents.A Freedom Monument was erected in Pniel in 1992.Tel: Municipality 021 808 8501/2 - Linda NicholsGoede Hoop (R310) A modern slave bell, dated 1934, marks the centenary of the abolition of slavery.Boschendal (R310) The farm Boschendal, with its imposing buildings forming a formal werf, is a landmark of the wine route.During the period of slavery, a long building divided into individual rooms, adjacent to the stables and kraals, was constructed to house slaves.It is still there today.Tel: 021 870 4200FRANSCHHOEKEstate inventories of this area show that slaves were often the farmers' greatest assets.They were dependent on slaves for labour.In 1806 the thriving wine industry in the Franschhoek Valley created a group of prosperous farmers.Wine and brandy were exported to European countries, and access to British markets after the Second British Occupation of the Cape in 1806, contributed to the economic upswing.Farms were modernised and farmhouses were redecorated.The well-known Cape Dutch gable became a symbol of the new prosperity.Slaves not only worked in the vineyards and orchards, but also as builders, carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers and painters and were responsible for making doors, window frames, shutters, nails, as well as thatching.Anna Speas and Elisabeth Anna KrielPAARLGebhart had the slave Joris flogged (139 lashes) for not working to his satisfaction.Joris was found dead the next day.After a protracted court case Gebhart was found guilty and sentenced to death.He was hanged on 15 November 1822.His gravestone is in the museum, a building which was once the Gebhart family's home.His father was the minister at the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church).An example of slave chains and entries into a transfer register can also be viewed in the museum.Tel: 021 872 2651Paarl Museum GravestoneHet Gesticht (Main Road) Mission work started early in the 19th century in Paarl.Het Gesticht was erected in 1813 by the Friends of the Mission Movement with the aim of providing religious training to slaves and coloured people.Before this, slaves and coloured people attended church services in the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church in Main Street) but it soon became too small to serve the community.The Paarlse Sending Genootskap took over the building as well as the training programme in 1819.Nuwe Plantasie (Plantasie Street, behind Grand Roche Hotel) Hermanus Bosman was the sieketrooster from 1707 to 1748 in the Drakenstein congregation.He applied to the Council of Policy for land in 1715 which, on receiving, he called De Nieuwe Plantage.Here he built a church for his slaves in 1737.Kleinbosch (R303, Dal Josafat) In the cemetery on this farm slaves called Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and Clara, are buried.They were freed slaves who settled with the Du Toit family.Klaas worked on the farm and his wife Clara worked as a respected midwife from 1830 to 1850.Kleinbosch belonged to DF du Toit, farmer and owner of Kleinbosch, and the father of the Reverend SJ du Toit, the well-known theologian and leader of the first Afrikaanse Taalbeweging.Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and ClaraWELLINGTONWagenmakersvallei Mission Church (Bovlei) Mission work among the slaves and coloured people in Wagenmakersvallei started in 1796 under JJ van Zulk who counted at least "300 heathens" consisting of Khoekhoen and slaves.He erected a structure (Gesticht) for this purpose which has not survived.In 1802 Daniel le Roux was appointed as "oefenmeester".The church was enlarged in 1868 to its current size.Two holy communion cups that were used by the congregation are housed in the Wellington Museum"Queen Rebecca"The 8th Countess of StamfordHouse of Martha Solomons (51 Bain Street) She was the daughter of a slave woman known as "Queen Rebecca" who owned a tavern in Cape Town after emancipation.Martha, who lived in Wellington, met and married Englishman Harry Grey, the black sheep of an aristocratic family.After the death of his cousin he inherited a title, and so his wife Martha, a slave descendent, became the 8th Countess of Stamford.Not open to the public.An interesting story is that of the Weigt slaves of Wagenmakersvallei.Their owners, Benjamin Weigt and Anna Lategan, were childless.Home > Publications > Public Information > P > Places of Slave Rememberance in the Western Cape &gt OverbergOverbergThe name means "over the mountains" - the Hottentots-Holland mountains.The area was explored by VOC traders and explorers and soon land was given out to farmers who settled there.With an abundance of land available on the frontier no free person wanted to work for someone else.The rapid expansion of the colony meant that slaves were also brought into the new areas.Older male slaves were dispersed among frontier regions on loan farms (the areas of extensive farming) where they worked as herdsmen.Slave auctions were held at Caledon and Swellendam.From the days of the Khoekhoen herders, this area had been a stock farming region.Many of the mission stations founded in this area exist today, for example Genadendal, Elim, Herbertsdale, Slangrivier, Suurbraak, Middleton and Teslaarsdal.Places of slave remembrance in the OverbergHangklipHot springs at Caledon Casino, Hotel and SpaTeslaarsdalMiddletonNapierSwellendamThe

to Cape Town, or tried to reach a group of escapees who survived for many years at Cape Hangklip.In 1709 a slave, Jacob Smith, organised a large-scale desertion from the Stellenbosch district.Forty-five slaves escaped and got as far as Swellendam where they were recaptured or returned voluntarily to their owners.A placaat of 1714 proclaimed that any slave who had been at large for three days or more and who resisted capture could be shot on sight by a colonist.In 1715 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Stellenbosch sought permission to cut the Achilles tendon of runaways.Hot springs at Caledon Casino, Hotel and Spa (N2) The Khoekhoen called the hot springs "dispore kamma" meaning "warm water".In 1708 land around the springs was granted to Ferdinand Appel on condition that he provided bathing facilities for people.Slaves worked here and rested, using their own facilties.Tel: 028 214 5100Elim bellHangklip caveHot springs at CaledonTeslaarsdal (R326) Johannes

slaves and weapons.The slaves, who were told to clean the weapons, seized the opportunity to take over the ship.Without navigation skills the slaves had to make use of the crew.The crew fooled them by sailing in the direction of Madagascar by day and to the Cape by night until they dropped anchor in Struisbaai.A few of the slaves went ashore where they were captured by local farmers.The remaining slaves became suspicious and in the resulting skirmish with the crew, the captain ordered the anchor cables to be cut.Three sealed bottles containing messages were thrown overboard.The ship ran aground soon afterwards, and the rest of the slaves were captured.One of the messages that were thrown overboard is housed in the Cape Archives Repository.Slave Monument,

celebratory feast for the bricklayers and plasterers who worked on the building.The bricklayers and assistants were all slaves.After emancipation in 1834 they continued their work as "apprentices".It is recorded that all manual labour was carried out by slaves and that European artisans contributed to the building through cabinet-making only.The slave bricklayers were Alec, Mirjam, Carto, Adonis and Lasson and the other slaves working on the building were Manjean, Moost, Lange Willem, Jan Rondganger, Willem Bruintjies, Ernest Witbooi, Tune Koopman, Willem Cornelis, Jacob Platjie, Frans Abraham, Aijerdien, Vaaltijn April, Jan Modecam, Willem Hunters, Kobes Wildeman, Fontijn, Jasson, Andries Carolus and Kiewiet.The church was consecrated in 1842.It is open on weekdays

uprising took place on the farm Houdenbek in the Koue Bokkeveld, Ceres district, in 1825.The uprising was led by Galant of the Cape, a slave of WN van der Merwe, and Khoekhoen labourers who killed four people, destroyed crops and then fled.They were caught, found guilty of high treason, murder and armed robbery, and were sentenced and executed in 1826.TULBAGHAlso known as Land van Waveren, or Roodezand.As in many other towns, slaves played an important role in the history of Tulbagh.Slaves built the second parsonage for the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Land van Waveren in 1765.The farmers Jan Theron, Pieter Theron, Isaac van der Merwe and Schalk van der Merwe were compensated for sheep, flour, wine, peas and beans supplied to the slaves working on the building.Jacobus Theron's slaves worked as reed and stone cutters, and the slaves of Jacobus du Toit supplied firewood for use in brick-making.Slaves also built a wine cellar (1783) and a mill (1790) for the minister.The minister had many problems with the locals using the mill, and so the church council decided that people who wanted to grind their corn had to supply a slave to do the work, and pay eight stuiwers to the church.Reverend Michiel Christiaan Vos gave his inaugural sermon to the Roodezand congregation on 4 May 1794, and caused great concern when he announced his intention to extend his evangelical work to workers and slaves.The congregation's reaction was that "they could already not do much with their slaves and what would happen if they receive an education".26 Church Street and Oefeningshuis The house was built in 1796 and in 1809 sold to the missionary Cornelis Kramer.The need arose in the Roodezand Sendinggenootskap to appoint a full-time teacher for the work among the slaves and Khoekhoen.With the emancipation of the slaves the number of learners rose dramatically, and this influenced the work of the Mission Society.Gustav Adolph Zahn was the first Rhenish missionary in Tulbagh to assist Vos in his teaching duties.They also raised funds for a mission church, which was inaugurated on 2 April 1845.It can be seen in Van der Stel Street but is not open to the public.Rev. VosGustav Adolph ZahnMachtelt Smit40 Church Street This house belonged to Machtelt Smit, the granddaughter of a German mercenary and a freed slave woman.The Roodezand Mission Society was

haven for freed slaves where they could build a house and have vegetable gardens.A small school building was erected for the smaller children.This settlement was called Steinthal and was taken over by the Rhenish Mission Society.Because of the high standard of education offered here, white children also attended classes.The table below gives a breakdown of the pupils in 1855.Today it is part of the Steinthal Children's Home.The school building is a heritage site and serves as a useful library and resources centre.It is presumed that the cemetery has slave graves.Tel: 023

KarooLittle KarooThis area is the fertile valley enclosed by the Swartberg, Langeberg and the Outeniqua mountains.The area was explored by European settlers from the late 17th century, who encountered Khoisan people living here.The semi-arid area was turned into a productive farming district.This area boasts the most spectacular rock formations and passes.Well-known mission stations situated here are Zoar, Amalienstein and Dysselsdorp.Click here for a map of the Little Karoo.ZOAR AND AMALIENSTEINZoar and Amalienstein (Not far from the Hoeko turnoff, about 21 km from Ladismith) The Zoar settlement was established in 1817 by Petrus Johannes Joubert, a missionary of the South African Missionary Society.He named the mission station after the biblical name "Zoar".When Joubert left in 1833 the South African Missionary Society found it difficult to replace him, and called in the help of the Berlin Mission Society which bought the adjacent land and set up its own station and named it "Amalienstein", after its benefactress, Frau Amalie von Stein.Here a church (1853), school and houses were erected.Zoar was run by Reinhold Gregorowski of the Berlin Mission Society from 1837.In 1838 Zoar had a church and huts forming a village which was inhabited by 300 to 400 Khoekhoen people.The inhabitants were taught farming methods and religious instruction and received an education.After emancipation, slaves settled at the mission stations.Tel: 028 561 1000Zoar ChurchHouse in ZoarHome > Publications > Public Information > P > Places of Slave Rememberance in the Western Cape &gt West CoastIn October 1808, 326 slaves from over 30 farms in this region rebelled and marched on Cape Town to demand their freedom.They were led by Louis of Mauritius, Abraham of the Cape and an Irishman James Hooper, who promised them their freedom.They concentrated on the slaves of Pieter Louw of the Swartland and spread the uprising towards Koeberg and Tygervalley.In total 34 farms were plundered, the farmers bound and taken prisoner.When the slaves began to march to Cape Town, the Govenor, the Earl of Caledon, dispatched soldiers to the troubled area and all 326 slaves were taken prisoner.Five of the ringleaders were hanged publicly and their corpses were displayed in order to deter anyone of like mind.Large numbers of slaves worked in the labour-intensive wheat farms and mixed farming areas found in the Swartland and West Coast.Many mission stations in this area also testify to the missionary work done among the Khoekhoen and the slaves.The well-known ones are Wupperthal and Mamre, but there is also Papendorp, Troe-Troe Mission station in Van Rhynsdorp and Ebenhaezer.Places of slave remembrance in the West CoastMamreGoedverwachtWupperthalClick here

Society at a former military outpost on the farm Louwplaas as well as the farms De Groene Kloof and Cruywagenskraal.The missionaries Kohrhammer and Schmidt set out to work among the local Khoekhoen

Burgerskloof from the owner, Hendrik Schalk Burger, upon emancipation in 1838.He left the farm to his slave Maniesa and her five children on condition that they take care of him until his death.His own children later contested the will, but the court upheld it and the farm remained Maniesa's property up to the death of her last child Hester in 1888.Her grave can be seen in the

their own studies have limited options, such as private loans from banks, part-time employment, assistance from family members and, for the lucky few, bursaries.For those who are academically deserving and financially needy, there is another option: NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme) offers a unique opportunity to access a loan, part of which can be converted to a bursary.The scheme also runs a number of loan or bursary schemes on behalf of other organisations and bodies, such as the Department of Labour.Get more information about these options from the Financial Aid Bureau at the university or technikon where you intend studying or where you have registered.What is NSFAS?The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is a loan and bursary scheme operating in terms of Act 56 of 1999 and funded by the National Department of Education.Where does TEFSA fit it?TEFSA, established in 1991, managed and administered the National Student Financial Aid Scheme since its inception in 1996.Act 56 of 1999 converted TEFSA into a statutory body called NSFAS in July 2000.CONTENTS: Student Guide to Funding - NSFASHome > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt How, What, When, Where ...How, What, When, Where ...What does NSFAS Offer?* The means to obtain a tertiary education.* Loans at low interest rates.* Loans without guarantees.* A reasonable repayment plan.What is a Loan?* A loan is money you borrow to cover tertiary studies.* This Loan has to be repaid.What is a Bursary?* A bursary is that portion of the award that does not need to be repaid.* The size of the bursary is dependent on your academic success.Who Qualifies for a NSFAS Loan?To qualify for a loan you must be:* registered at a South African university or technikon* an undergraduate, studying for a first tertiary educational qualification, or* studying for a second tertiary qualification, if this is necessary to practise in your chosen profession (eg LLB or HDE)* able to demonstrate potential for academic success* financially needy.How Much Money do you Get?The maximum award in 2004 was R25,000 and the minimum was R2,000.What is the Role of the University an Technikon's Financial Aid Bureaux?* Offer advice about loans.* Assist with loan applications.* Explain how you access the money and how you have to repay the money.* Evaluate your ability to succeed in your chosen course.* Conduct a means test that will determine whether you are really among the financially needy.Where do you Apply for a Loan?From Financial Aid Bureaux at the university or technikon where you are/or plan on studying.How is the Bursary Component of your Loan Calculated?Up to 40% of the award may be converted into a bursary, dependent on your end of year results.* If you pass all the courses for which you have registered, you qualify for a 40% bursary.* If you pass three quarters of the courses, you qualify for a 30% bursary.* If you pass half of the courses, you qualify for a 20% bursary.* If you pass one quarter of the courses, you qualify for a 10% bursary.* If you pass none of the courses, you qualify for no bursary at all.What Happens if You Have Money Left Over in Your Account?* You can't receive more money from NSFAS than you require.* If there is money left over in your fee account at the end of the year (for example, if you received a bursary or a merit award after the NSFAS award was granted), the Financial Aid Bureau has to return the money to NSFAS.This will count as your first loan repayment.* Money left over in your account is never paid out to you.Furthermore, it is in your interest to ensure that the money is returned to NSFAS to avoid paying interest on it.What about Interest?Interest on NSFAS awards will be calculated at 7% for 2004 as of 1 April 2004.What Is Interest and Why does NSFAS Charge It?Interest is the cost of borrowing money.Money, like any other commodity, has a price attached to it.If you deposit money into a bank account, you earn interest - in other words, the bank pays you because it can make use of your money while it is deposited with them.When you take back your money, you stop earning interest.If you borrow money from the bank, you have to pay the bank for the use of their money.In previous years commercial banks have charged as much as 23% interest on student loans.If you had received one of these loans you would be required to pay back the loan within a specific period whether you are employed or not.By comparison, NSFAS's interest rate is equal to the rate of inflation (typically in the late 1990s 9%) plus 2%.This 2% helps sustain the loan scheme.It contributes towards the administration costs and the shortfall resulting from death and long-term non-repayment due to unemployment.What is Inflation?* Each year money loses value and can buy less.* The decline in the value of money from one year to the next is called inflation.* An example of how inflation affects your studies is the increase in fees each year.* In order for NSFAS to be able to assist students in future, NSFAS has to try to make sure that the value of its money is retained.That is why its interest rate is tied to the inflation rate.* NSFAS's interest rate is low because it is subsidised by donations from government, private sector companies and overseas donors.Home > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt Paying Back the LoanPaying Back the LoanWhen Do You Start to Pay Back?Once you are employed and your annual salary is R26,300 or more.How Much Do You Pay Back?* The repayments are worked out at a rate that will not place a great burden on you.* Therefore, repayments are based on the salary that you earn.* And repayments only start once your salary is R26,300 or more per year (ie R2,192 per month).At this level your repayment is 3% of your annual salary.The rate at which you repay your loan is reflected in the Ready Reckoner Table.How Do You Pay Back?* NSFAS sends quarterly statements to all students and will later send a letter information you of your settlement terms once you become eligible to pay back your loan.This happens once you start earning over R26 300 a year.* You are then expected to make the necessary arrangements.These can include a debit order on your bank account, direct deposits into the NSFAS account, postal orders, cheques or employer deductions.* While NSFAS will inform you how much you need to pay, it is your responsibility to ensure that you keep in touch withHome > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt 10 Things You Need to Know about NSFAS10 Things You Need to Know about NSFAS1. NSFAS was established by the South African Government in 1996.2. It was set up to ensure that students, who have potential but cannot afford to fund their own studies, will have access to funding for tertiary education.3. It is funded by the government, international donors and the private sector.4. TEFSA, which was established in 1991, managed and administered the scheme until 2000 when TEFSA became NSFAS.5. All of the financial assistance received by a successful applicant takes the form of a loan.6. Up to 40% of loans can be converted into bursaries, depending on students' pass rates.7. Loan repayments are recycled to help future generations of students.8. The NSFAS Act of 1999 allows NSFAS to have employers deduct loan repayments from monthly salaries of those who have received assistance from the Scheme.9. Loan repayments are based on individuals' earnings.10. The interest charged on loans is subsidised and therefore considerably less than the commercial rate which is charged by banks.Home > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding

OverviewThere are a number of forms of financial relief available to different people in different circumstances, including:* The Unemployment Insurance Fund* The Occupational Injuries and Diseases Compensation Fund* The Road Accidents FundWho can claim from which fund?GrantsThere are a number of grants for poor people provided by the South African Social Security Agency.All grants are for poor people only (a "means test" applies).Unemployment InsuranceIf you have been employed, you can get unemployment insurance benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) run by the National Department of Labour.CompensationIf you are temporarily or permanently disabled because of an accident at work, you can get compensation from the Compensation Fund at the National Department of Labour.If you are injured in a motor vehicle accident, you can get compensation from the Road Accident Fund for your medical expenses, disablement, and loss of income.Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Social Security GrantsSocial Security GrantsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has three types of grant for looking after children:* Child Support Grant* Care Dependency Grant* Foster Child Grant.You can get a child support grant for each child under 14, if you are the child's primary care-giver.You can get a care dependency grant for each child under 18 who needs full-time care because of a physical or mental disability, if you are the child's parent or guardian.Both of these grants depend on how poor you are.You can get a foster child grant if you have been legally appointed a foster parent by a court.Whether you get this grant depends on how poor the child is, NOT on how poor you are.However, you CAN get a foster child grant and a care dependency grant, if you qualify for both.For adults, SASSA has the following kinds of grants:* Old age grant* Disability grant* War veteran's grant.The old age grant is for women over 60 and men over 65.The disability grant is for adults over 18 who are not able to work because of their disability.If you were disabled because of an accident at work, you may be able to get compensation from the Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund .If you were disabled because of a motor vehicle accident, you may be able to get compensation from the Road Accident Fund.The war veterans grant is for adults over 60 or anyone who is unable to work because of a disability, and who served in the 1st or 2nd World War or the Korean War.The provincial Department of Social Development can also provide temporary help in crisis situations with a financial award called "social relief of distress".This is for people who cannot provide for their families' basic needs because of a crisis of a temporary nature.Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) BenefitsUnemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) BenefitsIf you have been employed before, then you can collect Unemployment Insurance from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) if you have been unemployed for more than 14 days.If you have never had a job you cannot claim from the UIF.Everyone who works for more than 24 hours per month is supposed to be registered with the UIF and to make a contribution of 1% of their earnings (along with contributions from their employer) to the UIF.If you have been contributing, you can claim benefits if you become unemployed (if you are fired or retrenched, but not if you quit).You must claim your UIF benefit within 6 months of becoming unemployed.How much you can claim and for how long you can claim depend on how long you were working and how much you were earning.You can get one day's benefit for every 6 days you worked, up to a maximum of 238 days (which you reach after working for 4 years).You cannot claim any benefit for any amount of time that you worked and at the same time received a Social Services grant for yourself.If you earned more than R8099 per month before, you will get a flat benefit of R101,18 per day.For example, if you earned R1000 per month before, you will get R17,34 per day.UIF can also be claimed by the partner or dependants of a worker who has died.You can also get a UIF benefit if you can't work because of ill-health (for up to 6 months, but takes into account any sick leave).You can get a maternity benefit when you have a child, or an adoption benefit if you adopt a child younger than two years and have to take off work to look after the child.Only one parent can get maternity or adoption benefits.You must apply for the maternity benefit at least eight weeks before the birth of the child.You must apply for the adoption benefit within 6 months of the adoption order.You can apply for UIF benefits at any Labour CentreHome > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)The accident must be identified by its date, time and place and must have happened as a direct result of your employment.For temporary total disablement, you can get compensation equal to 75% of your monthly earnings, up to a maximum of R2 868,00 per week.For permanent disablement, where the degree of disablement is 30% or less, you can get a lump sum (one payment) which is usually equal to 15 times your monthly earnings.However, the minimum lump sum is 15 times R1359,00 = R20 385,00 (if you earn less than R1359 you will get R20 385).The maximum lump sum 15 times R6 963,00 = R104 445,00 (if you earn more than R6963,00 you will get R104 445,00).If the degree of permanent disablement is 31% or more, you will not get a lump sum, you will get a monthly pension instead.The pension for total permanent disablement (degree of disablement 100%) is equal to 75% of your monthly earnings.If the degree of disablement is less than 100%, the pension is proportionately less.If the employee's earnings are R1 359,00 per month or less, the pension is calculated on R1 359,00.The minimum pension in respect of 100% permanent disablement is therefore R1 019,25 per month.Where an employee dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to* a lump sum equal to two times the monthly pension to which the employee would have been entitled to if 100% disabled* a pension equivalent to 40% of the pension to which the employee would have been entitled, if 100% disabled.Where the employee dies, each child under 18 years of age is entitled to a monthly pension equal to 20% of the pension which would have been payable to the employee for 100% disablement, up to a maximum of three children.The maximum pension payable to the spouse and children together is therefore R9 321,00 per month.All reasonable medical and transport costs arising from the accident are also paid for by the Compensation Fund.You can apply for compensation from the Compensation Fund at any of these labour centres.How does this compensation affect a Social Security grant?Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)The Road Accident Fund (RAF) was set up to pay compensation in respect of people injured or killed in road accidents through the negligent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.The system was changed so that instead of compulsory insurance, there is now a fund, which gets its money from a levy on the sale of fuel.People can make a claim for compensation against the RAF if they are injured in a motor vehicle accident as a result of negligent driving.You must make your application to the RAF within 2 years of the date of the accident in which you sustained your injuries.You can make the claim yourself by completing Form 1 and submitting all the necessary documents; or you can get an attorney to help with your claim.The exact amount ("quantum") paid out for a claim against the RAF depends on your medical expenses, your loss of income (past and future), your disablement, and your pain and suffering.Road Accident Fund: Cape Town Contact Details:Physical Address7th FloorNo.1 Thibault SquareLong StreetCAPE TOWNPostal AddressPrivate Bag X28Tel : 021 408 3300Fax : 021 419 7417 / 8740How will compensation from the RAF affect a Social Security grant?If, taking into account any compensation you get from the Road Accident Fund, your income is still below the means test set by SASSA, you may qualify for one of the Social Security grants.In other words, if your income (including the compensation from the RAF) is less than R1410 per month, you may qualify also for the disability grant.Home > Publications > Public Information > T &gt Testicular CancerHome > Publications > Public Information > U &gt Patients Rights CharterHome > Publications > Public Information >

clothing, medical care and schooling.So, you must pay money as maintenance to help the parent living with the children to provide the children with these basic needs.If you do not pay maintenance, your children:1. may not have enough food;2. may not be able to see a doctor if they are sick;3. if school fees cannot be paid, may not be able to go to school.Maintenance ensures that your children keep, as much as possible, the same standard of living as before the parents separated.Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best

contribute his or her share towards their upbringing.However, the maintenance system is there if the parents cannot decide themselves how maintenance should be paid, or how much.The parent living with the children can go to a maintenance court in order to obtain maintenance from the other parent.The maintenance court can order the parent living away from the children to pay maintenance to the other parent, for the benefit of the children.The maintenance court will tell the parent how much is to be paid, when it is to be paid, and where it should be paid.Home > Publications > Public

if the parent living with the children has other children.f the parent, living away from the children, is concerned about the welfare of the children, he or she is still required to pay maintenance, though he or she could make a complaint to the welfare authorities or apply to a court to have the children come and live with him or her.If the parent living away from the children has other children himself or herself, he or she is still obliged to pay maintenance.He or she must still pay maintenance if her or she now lives with a new partner and that partner's children.However, there might be a change in how much maintenance a parent must pay if he or she has further children of his or her own.Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in

29 February, six months thereafter.The third payment is a voluntary payment that any provisional taxpayer may make.Taxpayers with a taxable income of more than R50 000 or companies with a taxable income of R20 000 or more, may make a third voluntary payment to avoid interest being levied on any underpayment of tax on assessment.The purpose of this payment is to enable taxpayers to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year, and the total tax liability for the year of assessment.The third period represents the total tax payable for the full year, less:the employees tax paid for the full yearany allowable foreign tax credits for the full yearthe amounts paid for the first and second provisional tax periods.It is up to each provisional taxpayer to identify when a top-up third payment is necessary.Obtain the new payment advice from SARS or download it from this site, complete it and submit it together with payment.Because the payment advice is generic and does not carry detail relating to a specific taxpayer, it is of the utmost importance that provisional taxpayers enter the correct account details on this advice.If the correct details are not entered, the payment cannot be credited to the correct taxpayer.The account details are made up as follows:The tax reference number of the taxpayerP0003 – indicating the payment period2005 – indicating the year of assessment.A typical payment reference number will thus be 1234567123P00032005.Provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidays.Where payments are made by mail, via the bank or ATM, sufficient time for mailing or processing must be taken into account.Where payments are done electronically, provision must be made for your bank's cut-off times and for a clearance period that could take between two and five days.the client's 19-digit payment reference numberThe third period payment should be based on actual taxable income, as the purpose of this payment is to enable you to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year and the full tax liability for that tax year.Return for the third provisional tax paymentReturn of general informationThe return of general information allows employers to supply the South

countries, persons who have been arrested outside their own country must have access to their consular representative.South Africans in this situation must immediately request the authorities to allow them to contact the South African Representative in that country.Alternatively, somebody can contact the South African Representative in that country or the Chief Directorate: Consular Services of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Pretoria on your behalf.Consular Officers seek to ensure that South African citizens arrested abroad are treated humanely while incarcerated.Issues such as torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment will be reported and taken up with the local authorities.The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners is used as a guide.Establish contact with the detainee as soon as possible after verifying South African citizenship. .Provide general information about the legal system of the country of arrest.Information may include details on legal aid and prosecution, a list of lawyers remand, bail and appeal procedures so that he/she understands his/her rights and the processes involved.Undertake prison visits.The frequency of prison visits depends on current policy, the location, culture and laws of the arresting State, the prevailing security situation in the country and/or the prison and subject to the Mission's operational circumstances.Ensure that medical problems are brought to the attention of the prison authorities.However, the operational priorities of the Embassy/High Commission/ Consulate take precedence.Local circumstances in the country also play a role.What Consular Officers cannot do for South Africans detained/arrested abroad:obtain or give legal adviceorganise a release from prison or bailtravel to dangerous areas or prisons for a prison visitinvestigate a crimeobtain better treatment in prison than that provided for local nationals, unless the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are not appliedinstruct next-of-kin or friends to transfer moneypay legal, medical or any other billsobtain accommodation, work, visas or residence permitsundertake work done by travel agents, airlines, banks or car rental companiesformally assist dual nationals in the country of their second nationalityin the unfortunate event of death, pay for the preparation, transport, burial or cremation of the mortal remains of a South African citizen.If a dual national is arrested/detained in another country, of which he/she is not a national, and he/she did not travel on a South African passport but on the passport of his/her second nationality, the dual national must contact the consular representative of the country on which passport he/she travelled.Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular RelationsNote: No Prisoner Transfer Agreements exist between South Africa and any other country.The service standard is determined on an individual case basis and depends on circumstances in the country of arrest.The Department of Foreign Affairs determines the cost where applicable, based on the services provided.The South African representative will provide the detainee with the relevant application forms.Home > Your Government > Provincial Government of the Western Cape > Department of Health > Services > Arts & Culture >

terms of the Plant Improvement Act, 1976, are officially sampled and tested to determine their quality.Official samples are tested in an attempt to ensure that only seed lots that comply with provisions of the Plant Improvement Act, 1976, and that are correctly and truthfully labelled, are offered for sale.Auditors in regional offices of the Department of Agriculture draw samples at random from trade control and imported seed from persons, i.e. organisations, institutes, companies, co-operatives and farmers, that sell seed.All available seed lots, that is both commercial and certified seed, are taken into consideration.Seed lots to be sampled are chosen as follows:a random choice of seed lotssuspect seed lotsproblematic crop types.Samples are tested for compliance with the provisions of the Plant Improvement Act such as purity and germination or viability.Auditors are notified of results.When results show that the seed is not in compliance with the Act, it may be withdrawn from sale or re-labeled.As this seed testing service is rendered in terms of national legislation, no service fee is charged.However, if the person from whom the sample is taken requests the test result in the form of a Seed Analysis Report, a treasury approved seed testing tariff must be paid.An invoice will be issued.Banking details are:Bank : Standard BankBranch name : ArcadiaBranch code : 01-08-45Account number : 011244887Account name : NDA: Seed Testing ServicesRemember to include the invoice number in order that it may be reconciled with the issued invoice.The Official Seed Testing Station uses a priority system for testing.As the various crop types have different test conditions, the duration of a test can vary from a few days to a few weeks.Make enquiries at the facility itself .Umphandle > Ushicilelo > IiNkcukacha Zoluntu: VIINKCUKACHA ZOLUNTU: VValue-Added Tax Refund Procedure (ifumaneka ngesiNgesi kuphela)(Uhlobo loxwebhu:

provided at no charge by the Government to poor households.The services include water, electricity, sanitation and waste removal.These services are provided by municipalities and include a minimum amount of electricity, water and sanitation that is sufficient to cater for the basic needs of a poor household.However, policies regulating the provision of basic sanitation and refuse removal are yet to be finalised by the relevant sector departments of Water Affairs and Forestry and Environmental Affairs and Tourism .Free basic waterFree basic water consists of at least a basic amount of 6 kl of water per month per household.This amount may differ among municipalities and you should contact your municipality directly to find out exactly what the free basic water service is that they provide.Free basic electricityThe amount of free basic electricity is 50kWh per household per month for a grid-energy system .This amount of electricity will be enough to provide basic lighting, basic water heating using a kettle, basic ironing and access to a small black and white TV and radio.Users who have pre-paid electricity meters will be able see when the free electricity is used up and will be required to buy more electricity at their own expense.Users with conventional or credit meters will not be able to see easily when they have used up their units.Consumers who do not have access to grid energy electrification could be provided with non-grid energy by their municipalities.You should contact your municipality to find out the type of alternative sources of energy provided.To have electricity and water connected in your home or business premises, contact the municipality of the area in which you have a new home or business.In certain areas, the national supplier, Eskom, supplies electricity directly.Free basic sanitationThe government has not yet implemented the free sanitation programme.The Department of Water Affairs is developing a framework for the provision of free basic sanitation.When the strategy is finalised, the local authorities that provide sanitation services will implement it.Free basic refuse removalThe government has not yet implemented the free waste removal programme.The Department of Environmental Affairs ant Tourism is developing a framework for the provision of free basic waste removal services.When the strategy is finalised, the local authorities that provide waste removal services will implement it.Paying for municipal servicesThere are two payment options for municipal services:Pre-paid accountsPrepaid account means that you buy units at your own expense and may only use the number of units bought.Once you have used up all the units, and you still need more you need to buy more.Billed accountsBilled accounts allow you to use any amount of electricity or water.Your municipality will send you a monthly statement showing the amount of electricity or water consumed and the amount of money that you must pay.Contact your local municipal offices.proof of residential or business property occupancyThe Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Section 152 .The

three spheres: Local, Provincial and National.Each sphere's responsibilities are outlined in the Constitution.Provincial government can make and administer provincial laws in its areas of jurisdiction (e.g. liquor licences, provincial planning, cultural matters, recreation, roads and traffic).It shares certain areas with national government, such as health, education and social services.Local governments' role includes local service delivery, promoting a safe and healthy environment, and promoting development.Governments have a political and an administrative arm.The political arm creates the laws and policies.Citizens elect representatives to the national parliament, the provincial parliament and the local councils.The Administrative arm is the part of government that implements laws and provides services.It consists of all the Departments (e.g. Health, Agriculture).The governments that are relevant to the Western Cape are:* The Government of

No firearms or ammunition can be brought onto the school premises . Body cavity searches and strip-searches may not be carried out on learners . This brings with it a terrorising fear factor which traumatises educators , learners and parents . The local SAPS representative will help with this process . What is the degree of trauma ? Inform the community of what it means to be a firearm free zone . The principal , in the absence of a police officer , upon reasonable suspicion , can conduct a search of any learner in possession of illegal drugs and dangerous objects . Annexure A  Any person doing so can be charged in court with having committed a crime and can be given a heavy prison sentence . Activities outside the school have a disruptive influence on what happens inside the school in a variety of ways . Who witnessed the death , injury or trauma ? One of the countrys greatest challenges is the high incidence of crime and violence which is exacerbated by high unemployment , poverty and social deprivation together with the ready availability of drugs and alcohol which has lead to widespread substance abuse . Will it be necessary for the SAPS and will they be available to escort learners home ? Gun free zones  This can negatively impact on innocent residents in certain areas . How many learners will be unsupervised at home in the violent areas ? Procedure for conducting searches and seizures Inform your Safe Schools coordinator in the EMDC or Safe Schools Call Centre . Official letters should be sent to parents to inform them about the procedures for searches and seizures . Maintain the school as a FFZ  Do you have a mechanism in place to inform parents of early closure ? Dangerous object free zones  The school-based safety officer will fulfil this mandate . School Governing Bodies and Safety Committees should be informed . This has no standing in terms of the Firearms Control Act , and can only be enforced by using common law and laws around trespassing . Murder , gang violence , suicide , shooting ? Safety Committee must implement the policy . Are the SAPS patrolling adequately ? What happened ? The Safety Committee must implement the FFZ at the school . Where did the shooting take place ? No firearms or ammunition can be stored on the school premises . Random searches and seizures are prohibited . In accordance with Government Notice 22754 , all schools are declared dangerous object free zones . Schools may use the following procedures in creating a firearm free or gun free zone . Checklist for closure of school due to Gang Violence : Gangs appear to deliberately choose the arrival and departure times of educators and learners to begin their shoot-outs . Educators are often absent because they need time off for trauma counselling and debriefing . In order for the school to be a firearm free zone the following must be adhered to : The school community should agree to making the school a firearm free zone . In line with the functions outlined in the South African Schools Act , the areas of responsibilities are the following : The school principal needs to appoint a Safety Officer in writing . Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 15 The SSC should consist of SGB members and representatives of religious and sport bodies , management , local business , local SAPS , local government , parents and community organisations . Step 1 : Establish a Safety Committee  Signs must be placed at the entrances of the school to say that it is a FFZ . In accordance with the South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 : Regulations for Safety Measures at Public Schools , Paragraph 4 , a police official or , in his absence , the principal or delegate may , without warrant - search any public school premises if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that a dangerous object or illegal drugs may be present in the public school premises in contravention of the regulations ; search any person present on the public school premises ; What other tragedies have impacted on this particular school recently ? Firearm free zones In April 2001 , the Firearms Control Act was signed into law . It is clear that increasing endemic gangsterism is systematically destroying the fabric of large segments of Western Cape society . In the absence of a police officer , the principal or delegated educator may conduct a search . This impacts negatively on education in general and on what happens in the school in particular . Perceived allegiance to a particular gang is usually determined by where one lives . A School Safety Committee consisting of a wide range of service providers is the most important element in developing a positive attitude towards critical analysis . Where did the death , injury or trauma occur ? Should it be decided to close the school and dismiss the learners , when would be an appropriate safe time ? A gun free zone is created by a voluntary declaration of a premise as a gun free area by the community or owners of a building . If it is felt necessary to close the school , the school principal and the schools Safety Committee must look at the checklist and make a recommendation to the EMDC director or delegated authority who may grant permission for closure of school . Educate newcomers about the FFZ . Request a police officer to do the search . According to the law , the Minister for Safety and Security can declare any place to be a FFZ . What constitutes a Safety Committee ? South Africa has many challenges . Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 19 Searches and seizures should be included in the schools Code of Conduct and Safety Plan . seize any dangerous object or illegal drugs present on public school premises or on the person in contravention of these regulations . It can be a school , hospital , workplace or any other area . Section 17 of the OHSA prescribes that for every 20 - 50 employees there should be one safety representative on the school premises . The only difference is the penalties attached to it . Is the shooting likely to continue throughout the day ? Daily reports appear in the written and electronic media about high levels of violence , physical and sexual abuse and gang activities . Explore alternatives to violence . During a search , human dignity shall be observed and persons of their own gender shall search learners in private . Procedure for the closure of school due to Gang Violence  A school should preferably not be closed , but an attempt should rather be made to try to normalise and stabilise the school setting as soon as possible . This seriously impacts on teaching and learning . Procedures Procedures for declaring gun free zones are the same as for declaring firearm free zones . Were the SAPS informed ? Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 17 . Adopt the policy  This new law makes provision for firearm free zones . Develop a policy  search any public school premises if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that a dangerous object or illegal drugs may be present in the public school premises in contravention of the regulations ; search any person present on the public school premises ; ﻿A right to benefits in terms of the Act shall lapse if the accident in question is not brought to the attention of the commissioner or of the employer or mutual association concerned , as the case may be , within 12 months after the date of such accident . A claim for compensation in terms of the Act shall be lodged by or on behalf of the claimant in the prescribed manner with the commissioner or the employer or the mutual association concerned , as the case may be , within 12 months after the date of the accident or , in the case of death , within 12 months after the date of death . Direct the schools Safety Committee to take charge of situation Be visible , available and supportive  National Crime Prevention Strategy National Educational Policy Act Occupational Health and Safety Act Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act South African Schools Act Managing Safety and Security within WCED Institutions 29 Bertram Jacobs  Brainstorm and then formulate a clear vision as to what is to be accomplished . What to audit ?

Whereas Ad-Hoc Committees are temporary , they only exist for the time that it takes them to finish a task assigned to them . However , a Provincial Constitution must correspond with the National Constitution and be confirmed by the Constitutional Court . If you want to give your input on any matter discussed on a national level , you can do it through the NCOP . The Leader of the House together with the Presiding Officers and Whips of parties helps with the coordination and scheduling of business before the Legislature . Besides being able to make provincial laws on the following matters : Portfolio Committees can also call MECs and other structures within the departments to reflect on the work done by them . New National Party 2 seats  The responsibility of the Legislature is to oversee the work of the Executive Council , to consider and approve the bills submitted to it by the Executive Council and to propose and consider legislation submitted by their own members . Your voice , as well as the voice of all the other citizens of this country , is heard in parliament . COMMITTEES ARE MORE INCLUSIVE  Often they hold hearings or ask for submissions . This means that Committees in the Legislature have a very important role to play . The Constitution is clear that the Provincial Legislature must have real power to discuss , change or even reject Bills that come from the Executive Council . When the legislature is not in session , it may be easier to reach your representatives through their constituency offices . These questions may be asked for either written or verbal reply . The people you voted for are accountable to you , because it is you who elected them . Every year the Committees hold hearings on the budget and how the money in each Department is spent . There are three types of committees in the Legislature , Standing , Household and Ad-Hoc Committees . The Constitution is the highest law of our land and gives every citizen rights and obligations . roads  If you want to make contact with a Committee , these are the people you should speak to . The National Assembly , the NCOP and the Provincial Legislature have a Leader of Government Business . casinos , racing , gambling and wagering  They must make sure that the party administration operates effectively and they must also organise speakers and voting in the House . The Premier appoints Members of the Executive Council , from amongst the Members of the Legislature , to head each provincial government department . To ensure that the people have the government they support , the Constitution says that there must be an election at least every five years . Most of the work on Bills is done in the Portfolio Committees . The party that wins the largest amount of votes is the majority party and will form the new Government . It is also possible that the Chairpersons of these Committees are from opposition parties . They must listen to what you have to say and they must make sure that the views of the voters are taken into account when they vote for laws . Each of the various Government departments is dealt with by one of the Portfolio Committees of the Legislature . People struggled for a very long time for democracy in our country . Each political party has its own Whips headed by a Chief Whip from the majority party . The Standing Committees are also known as Portfolio Committees , covering all the portfolios of the Executive Council of the Province . The Committees have the power and the duty to ask any person that works for the Provincial Government to explain their actions . A Provincial Legislature may adopt a constitution for its province if two thirds of its Members agree . The political parties that won seats in the Free State Legislature in the 1999 elections are : Committees discuss , make changes , and add the inputs received from the public to the Bills . All parties in the Legislature have the right to representation on Committees and quite often the proposals of minority parties are accepted . Caucus meetings are not open because it is here that parties must decide on their strategy and on matters which effect them as a party . This also means that you have the right to contact any person representing you namely Members of the Legislature , Members of the National Council of Provinces and the Members of the National Assembly . Contacting your representatives in the Legislature can be done in one of the following ways . road traffic regulation  The purpose of the NCOP is to give inputs on national matters from the perspective of the provinces . urban and rural development  In an election , everybody over the age of 18 years of age may vote for the political party that they support . education at all levels , excluding university and technikon educ . The word parliament means to speak . Household Committees runs the internal affairs regarding Members and procedures of the Legislature . Elections were held once again in 1999 and will be held every five years after that . The Committees must take into account the views of the public . Different from the other arms of the government , the judiciary are not elected , but independent . This means that you have the right to contact any MPL or any Committee if you wish to inform them of your views . Members of the Legislature may ask questions to the MECs related to the governing of their respective departments . You can also contact your representatives at the constituency office in your area . This means that you have the right to attend meetings of the Committees of the Legislature and the Sittings of the Legislature . Even if the Committee does not hold public meetings , you have the right to inform the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee or any of its members about matters that may concern you . THE LEGISLATIVE ARM  You can phone or write to them at the Free State Legislature . To protect our new democracy we have a set of rules known as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa . The responsibility of the Executive Council is to run the province . The Committees do much of the important work of the Legislature . traditional authorities  They make changes to Bills that come from the Executive Council and question MECs and Departments about the work that they do . regional planning and development  The Whips are responsible for organising their own political parties in the Legislature . This is your right . language policy  provincial public media  The Legislature can also call on Members of the Executive Council to explain their actions at any time . A member may request the House or the Speaker time for a debate on matters of public importance . The Leader of Government Business is appointed by the Executive and represents the Executive in Parliament/Legislature . trade and industrial promotion  His/her responsibility is to run and to preside over the meetings of the Legislature . Each Committee has a Chairperson and a Committee Clerk . These people form the Provincial Executive Council . WHO ARE THE PRESIDING OFFICERS ? This system is known as proportional representation . It is here that the voices of all the people of the country are heard through their elected representatives . THE EXECUTIVE ARM  agriculture  Each political party that has won enough votes in the election has Members in the Legislature . The People of the Province must hold Members of the Legislature accountable , as they are the direct representatives of the people . Even where they do not hold hearings , the public can inform the Chairperson or members of Committees about issues that concern them . cultural affairs  The press can attend and report on what is discussed in these meetings and therefore keep the public informed . ARMS OF STATE  The Presiding Officers must make sure that all the Members obey the rules of the Legislature at all times . Committees can investigate matters brought under their attention and are also responsible for the majority of the work done on Bills . Apart from the Provincial Legislature each province is also represented in the National Parliament through the National Council of Provinces . The NCOP was created by the Constitution in order to build a stronger link between the National Parliament and the nine provinces . The nine provinces created in terms of the Constitution brought about a new system of second-tier government . Democratic Party 2 seats  WHO IS THE LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ? NATIONAL REPRESENTATION  During the Sittings of the Legislature the final approval of Bills takes place and the parties can debate these Bills . WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 1994 ? public transport  The position of Provincial Government and Local Government , which is recognised as a separate level of government , is entrenched in the Constitution . African National Congress 25 seats  Each province has a delegation of ten people led by the Premier or his/her representative . Although it is the legislative arm that makes the law , it is the courts that must punish those that break them . Each party holds a caucus on a regular basis . The caucus is where the party decides how it will deal with the issues before the Legislature . If it is an important Bill , the committee will hold public hearings or ask for submissions . Ask the switchboard operator to put you through to your MPL or leave a message for him or her . THE JUDICIARY ARM  The NCOP represents all nine provinces through their respective delegations . In 1994 , for the first time , all South Africans over the age of 18 voted for a new Parliament . When the Legislature passes a law , it has a duty to take into account exactly what the members of the public feel . The power of the state is divided into three parts that function seperately from one another . Because of this , the public can effect decisions that are taken . The courts are responsible to try people who are accused of breaking the law and if they are found guilty , to sentence them to punishment . Debates  local government  Nobody is above this supreme law , even the President and Parliament must act according to the Constitution . The elected parties must report back on the decisions made in parliament . It is at these elections that we all cast our votes for the political party that we support . WHAT IS THE NCOP ? ﻿Governorprimary objective of the Bankthe achievement and maintenance of price stabilitycontainment of inflationwithin the target rangedomestic and international

implementation of the act and the general enjoyment of the right of access to information .these annual reports are available free of charge at the commissions offices and on the commissions website .the guide on how to use the promotion of access to information act - act 2 of 2000 - page 39how is this different from existing services ?faster .on trunk routes vehicles will have their own lane , and there will be a regular , frequent , scheduled service on feeder routes .safer .there will be security personnel at the main stations and there will be cctv cameras in the stations and the vehicles .security will be a priority .drivers will be monitored and there will be vehicle tracking to make sure there is no speeding or reckless driving and that vehicles will be at the stations on time .comfortable and accessible .the vehicles will be modern and clean , with space for seated and standing passengers .the vehicles are also adapted to be accessible to the elderly , children and people with disabilities and to provide space for wheelchairs .sustainable .low-emission vehicles and more people using public transport rather than private cars will offer environmental benefits .affordable .while establishing the system will cost billions of rand , the aim is to have fares that are comparable with those currently charged .easy to use .a smart card system will be used that will allow passengers to transfer from one trunk route to another on a single fare .these cards will be widely available , at stations and through other retailers .what does this mean for passengers ?the service will run for far longer ― during the day , into the evening and at weekends and will be regular , frequent and reliable .once the full system is in place , people will be able to travel around the city to visit friends and family , shopping centres and places of leisure , and tourists will be able to get around easily .the aim is to have easy access between the system and other ways of getting around , such as walking , cycling , metered taxis , and park-and-ride facilities .a non-motorised transport plan is being developed for each of the stations .what does this mean for people in private vehicles ?where special busways are envisaged , some road space will be lost to private motorists , and traffic signals will prioritise public transport vehicles .this will encourage people using private cars to switch to using the new system .the separation of public transport from general traffic can be beneficial to both public transport and cars .the bus-minibus taxi lane on the n2 has saved private cars over 20 minutes in travelling time .streets where private motorists will lose road space to the new system are parts of the r27 and in the centre of town at hertzog boulevard , heerengracht , parts of adderley street , hans strijdom avenue and parts of western boulevard .who will run the system ?the city of cape town will build the special busways and specify the levels of service , cost of the fares and the kinds of vehicles to be used .private sector companies will provide the actual operations and services .the operator will be paid on the basis of how many kilometres the vehicles travel and by meeting other performance standards .there will be a separate tender process for an independent company to collect the fares .there will also be an oversight agency established to monitor the quality of the service and to deal with complaints from the public .what does this mean for the current operators ?the city of cape town is talking to representatives of the bus and minibus industry in order to ensure that they play a central role in the new system .the objective is to achieve a high quality of service while improving profitability and working conditions in the industry .what does this mean for workers in the industry ?the new system is expected to create many jobs , not just in the construction phase but also in the operations .working for the new system will mean permanent jobs with all the benefits of formal employment , such as job security , regular hours of work , predictable income , leave , sick leave and maternity benefits .the new system will have many benefits for workers in the industry .where is the money for this project coming from ?the system is being financed through support from national government and the city of cape town .all three spheres of government , including the western cape provincial government , are committed to transforming public transport in cape town .much of the funding is being made available to meet the cape towns requirements for hosting the 2010 world cup .when will all this happen and how will it affect me ?all the phase 1a routes are planned to be operating by march 2010 , which will allow time to iron out the inevitable teething problems by the time the world cup begins in june .from the end of 2008 , construction work can be expected on the main parts of the route ― especially in the city centre and on the green point / sea point route and between the city and bayside mall , along blaauwberg road and up to the du noon area .careful planning is being done to minimise any traffic impacts during construction .how can i get more information ?erm has been appointed by the city to engage the communities that will be directly affected by phase 1a .in late 2008 they will be contacting representatives of these communities and holding public events to explain the proposals in more detail .if you are interested in being involved in these public processes , please contact linda slabber by phoning 021 702 9100 or by emailing linda.slabber @ erm.com .the irt is a way of ensuring that all modes of public transport work together and have priority over private transport .a major part of this is a bus rapid transit system ― a fast , modern road-based system .cape towns irt system will be based on examples of rapid transit systems that are working well in many parts of the world , including latin america , asia , north america and australia .it can work well here too , giving capetonians a regular , frequent , fast and reliable form of public transport .how will the irt work ?there will be two parts to the service :trunk routesfeeder routeson the trunk routes there will be separate , dedicated busways for special 18-metre articulated vehicles .there will be weatherproof , enclosed stations in the centre of the road on these routes , which will ensure that the vehicles can move quickly past other traffic and that people can wait in safety and comfort .the feeder services , with shorter 8m and 12m vehicles , will carry people to the trunk routes in normal traffic with stations along the side of the road .each vehicle will have several wide doors that open level with the station platform so that lots of people can get in and out quickly .the service will operate for 18 hours a day and vehicles will be frequent .the frequencies will range between a few minutes in peak hours and at least three times an hour when there is less demand .fares will be affordable and comparable with those charged by buses and minibuses at the moment .where will the system go ?the city of cape towns aim is to establish an irt network across the city within 10 to 12 years .the network will ensure that over 75 of the people are within 500 meters of a high-quality public transport system .this can only be achieved one step at a time .there are four phases for rolling out the irt .the first phase will be done in two steps , one to be completed before the world cup in 2010 and the other soon after the event .phase 1a : this phase will provide a link from the airport to the city centre and from the city centre to green point , sea point and hout bay , and around the city bowl suburbs .phase 1b : the proposed routes will extend the first phase to include special busways to century city andmontague gardens and busways from the airport to bellville and durbanville , strand and gordons bay , claremont and constantia , and table view via century city .phase 2 : this phase will link the densely populated south east of the city , which includes mitchells plain and khayelitsha , to destinations across the peninsula .phases 3 and 4 : the final phases will expand and link routes to the complete network , including areas such as delft , blue downs and stellenbosch .what exactly will phase 1a include ?the map has solid lines representing trunk routes and dotted lines showing feeder routes .there will be two trunk routes :example of a feeder service bus .cape town is getting an integrated rapid transit systemthis document outlines :what an integrated rapid transit system ishow the system will workwhere the system will gohow the system will affect commuters , existing operators and other road userswhen the project will be implementedthe solid red line shows the route from the v & a waterfront , through the centre of cape town , through paarden eiland to bayside centre and along blaauwberg road to du noon , doornbach and killarney gardens .feeder routes , marked by dotted lines , will run around the city bowl suburbs , from the end of sea point to camps bay and on to hout bay , and from camps bay over kloof nek to town .on the west coast , the feeder services will run around table view and parklands , to bloubergstrand and atlantis , including the atlantis industrial area and saxonsea , and to mamre .the feeder service will also run along racecourse road , through montague gardens to century city and richwood .how did the city decide upon phase 1a ?as a host city for the 2010 soccer world cup , the city of cape town has signed a contract with fifa to provide transport services between the airport , the city centre and the green point stadium area .phase 1a also focuses upon delivering quality public transport to the west coast which includes some of the communities with the most pressing mobility needs , such as mamre , atlantis , doornbach , du noon , and the joe slovo informal settlement , near milnerton .this west coast area also currently experiences some of the most severe traffic congestion .on 27 august 2008 the city of cape town gave the go-ahead for phase 1a , and approved the budget of r1.3 billion .city of cape town : approved level 1 water restrictionsnotice to all users of municipal potable water : approved level one restrictions shall apply from 1 november 2005

development challenges of poor areas , especially the informal settlements , and the need to maintain our cbds and the world-class infrastructure in established areas , says mayor nomaindia mfeketo .while much of our operating budget of r8,4 billion will be spent on maintaining high levels of service in established areas , the capital budget of r1,7 billion will be directed at poorer areas , in particular upgrading informal settlements which house an estimated 15 of our population .vanjaar sal die stad byna r300 miljoen op die stadspolisie bestee wat die ontplooiing van ' n verdere 100 beamptes insluit .die tarief is gebaseer op die bestuur van wateraanvraag deur ' n hoër tarief vir groot hoeveelhede te hef en ' n basiese voorsiening van gratis water aan elke huishouding .your municipal accountwhats new this year ?more free electricity , cheaper water up to 12 kl , and a new way to calculate sanitation charges .but the good news is that typical households with a property value of r200 000 or less should pay less than inflation increases and those valued at under r100 000 will pay less than last year with present consumption patterns .for higher value properties , with a traditionally high consumption of water and electricity , the key is to manage the consumption of these resources .watercape town is an area facing a long-term water shortage the tariff is based on managing water demand by charging a higher rate for large quantities of water used and providing a basic supply of free water to every household .the first 6kl are free for everyone.to assist residents , the price for 6kl - 12kl has been reduced to below average cost by introducing a new step in the water tariff .for anyone using less than 15kl a month , the water bill will come down .water tariffs forkl r2.00 per kl kl r4.00 per kl kl r5.10 per kl kl r6.20 per kl kl and above r8.00 per kl sanitationsanitation levyresidential properties 0,153 cents in the randindustrial

detailssecurity and working conditions will be better with the new system .new opportunities for the minibus taxi industrythe minibus taxi industry has played an important role in keeping the people of cape town on the move .taxi operators saw an opportunity in the lack of public transport in township areas , and now operate across the city .even though they did not receive subsidies , minibus taxi operators have provided customised services that other modes have not been able to offer .today , the industry and the market are changing .the minibus taxi industry is faced with many pressures , including rising fuel prices , rising labour costs and competition from private cars .the system entails existing operators joining forces to become shareholders in new operator businesses .these businesses will provide regular transport services on designated trunk and feeder routes by operating and managing fleets of new vehicles .there would be a number of advantages , including :predictable income , because the state will pay the operators per kilometres travelled rather than for the number of passengers carrieddedicated lanes , enabling more runs in the busy peak periods good working conditions for employees , with better pay , training , shorter hours and more career opportunitiesa bigger market for public transport as people switch from private cars to the new systemthe new system offers existing operators an opportunity to grow their businesses , and participate in a new system that will change our city for the better .the city of cape town sees those minibus taxi and bus operators whose services will be upgraded by the irt , as preferred partners .already , operators in the minibus taxi industry have started to grow and diversify their businesses , taking up opportunities in tourism , and learner and student transport .some have even expanded into related industries , including fuel stations , vehicle dealerships , parts and maintenance .the minibus taxi industry is maturing , and the entrepreneurs who lead it have shown that they can build and expand their businesses .as the city of cape town moves ahead with integrated rapid transit , it is looking for a strong partnership with existing operators in planning and developing the system , and ultimately becoming the operators of the new service .the existing minibus and bus industries must have a voice in shaping the new system .their expertise will be important in delivering a quality product to the customer .increased profitabilitythe new system will deliver increased profitability for operators .this will be achieved through dedicated lanes , a better fuel economy , bulk buying of new kinds of vehicles and parts , and coordinated marketing and advertising to attract new customers .a level playing fieldthe minibus taxi industry has never received operating subsidies from government .there has long been a sense of unfairness , as some operators are compensated , while others are not .in the new business model , all operators will be treated equally on a level playing field .in addition , government will provide capital subsidies to all .building a partnership with minibus taxi operatorsa better way of moving people transforming transport in cape townthe city of cape town is proposing to make far-reaching changes to the citys transport system with the introduction of the integrated rapid transit system .the city of cape town is engaging with minibus taxi operators to form a partnership to make this a reality .minibus taxis keep cape town movingthe minibus taxi industry has played an important and historic role in moving the people of cape town .the industry is the critical link ensuring that ordinary people and low-income communities access jobs and other opportunities throughout the city .while the minibus taxi industry grew despite the difficulties experienced during the apartheid era , it has continued to contribute to south african society up to the present day , and will no doubt continue to do so .in addition to the vital transport services the industry provides , it is also a large employer , and many families and communities depend on the industry for their livelihood .with its important history and contribution to the local economy , the city of cape town wants all existing operators to participate in and benefit from the new system .an example of a trunk bus .phase 1a : 2008 ― march 2010the first phase is a pilot or demonstration phase for the rest of the project , and focuses on the areas of the city that need special transport services for the 2010 fifa world cuptm .this phase will serve as a way to test operations , and make necessary adjustments .it will also give the industry across the city an opportunity to see how the system will work , and the range of opportunities it offers for the minibus taxi industry as a whole .this will include a link from the airport to the city centre , and from the city centre to green point , sea point and hout bay , and around the city bowl suburbs .there will be a route up the west coast to bayside mall , the full system .along blaauwberg road and up potsdam road to du noon , and services to bloubergstrand , atlantis and mamre , as well as around table view and parklands , and through montague gardens via century city to richwood .phase 1b : after 2010the proposed routes will extend the first phase to include special busways to maitland station , century city and montague gardens , as well as additional airport services to bellville , durbanville , claremont , wynberg and constantia .phase 2this phase will link the densely populated south east of the city , which includes mitchells plain and khayelitsha , to destinations across the peninsula .phases 3 and 4the final phases will expand and link routes to the complete network , including areas such as delft , blue downs and stellenbosch .under pressurechallenges facing the industrymore congestionmore congestion means slower speeds for public transport .in turn , the slow speeds increase costs , such as fuel costs and wear and tear on the vehicles .congestion also makes travel times longer for customers , which discourages public transport use .be under threat over the coming decades as private vehicle ownership increases .unless the quality of public transport is dramatically increased , capetonians will continue flocking to private cars at an ever-faster rate .already , there are more than a million cars in cape town , approximately one car for every three people .supply .this will continue to drive up the price of oil .also , south africa is a net importer of oil , producing only a limited amount of oil ourselves , making us dependent on oil producers in other parts of the world .this will continue to place pressure on our economy into the future , calling for more efficient use of this limited natural resource .more cars , less public transporteach year , private car ownership is increasing in cape town .as incomes increase , more people are abandoning public transport for private cars .if the current trend continues , the very existence of the minibus taxi industry will increasing private car ownership in cape town , between 2001 and 2007 .unpredictable fuel costsover the last months , the cost of fuel has increased considerably as a result of increasing oil prices and the weak rand .all indications are that the price of oil and petrol will continue to rise .many analysts believe that the extraction of oil from the earth has reached its peak , and that demand for oil will begin to exceedpermit problemsthe permitting system for the minibus taxi industry is not working as well as it should .currently , the perception is that some routes are overtraded , with too many permits issued .on the other hand , the waiting time for the processing of applications is very long .what is hijacking ?hijacking is the violent theft of a motor vehicle from its owner or driver , and is not classified as a specific crime .the actual offence is robbery and may include aggravated circumstances .robbery is defined as the unlawful and intentional violent removal and appropriation of moveable corporeal property belonging to another person , where force or the threat of force is used .characteristics of hijackingsall hijackings occur unexpectedly .most hijackings are planned .provocation is not a prerequisite for a hijacking .hijackings occur at anytime , day or night .hijackings can happen anywhere , in urban or rural areas .any vehicle can be targeted , depending on the demand for it .common hijacking situationsyou could be hijacked ―while stationary on freeway on or off ramps ;while loading goods at home or at work ;while loading passengers ;while stationary on the side of the road ;while stationary in a parking area ;while stationary at stop signs or traffic lights ;at home , at your gates or in your driveway ; and / or by ambush .hijacking preventionwhen approaching your vehicle , have your car keys ready and lock all doors immediately once you are inside your vehicle .keep your car and house keys on separate key chains .make sure you are not being followed .when approaching a traffic light at night or in secluded areas , reduce speed to avoid having to bring your vehicle to a complete stop .turn the radio down and observe all approach angles to your vehicle .if a suspicious person approaches ― and it is safe for you to do so ― drive away .keep your vehicle in first gear when stationary ― this will allow for a quick getaway in the case of an emergency .maintain sufficient escape space between vehicles when stationary .if you cannot afford to have safety film fitted to your vehicles windows , always leave an opening of ± 5 cm from the top .do not leave valuable items , like handbags , cellphones or laptops on the passenger or back seat ― lock these items in the boot .kids and car safety seats : put the child in the car safety seat è get into the car è lock all the doors è finish buckling up the child .when trying to buckle up children and you are bent over into the car , it is impossible to see what is going on around you !when driving alone , let a family member or friend know the route you are taking and the expected time of arrival at your destination .social crime prevention tel : socialcrime @ tshwane.gov.zathe integrated coastalmanagement billa brief guide to assist the public participation process environment & tourism department :environmental affairs and tourismparliament requires the publication for public comment of bills in the government gazette before such bills are introduced in parliament for the purpose of promulgating them as legally binding acts .this is in line with the constitutional imperatives that government ensures accountability , responsiveness and openness .during the first week of december 2006 the cabinet approved the publication in the government gazette of the integrated coastal management bill for public comment .in a press release issued on 8 december 2006 , marthinus van schalkwyk , the minister of environmental affairs & tourism , announced that the bill would be gazetted on 15 december 2006 .the minister pointed out that due to its complexity the bill would be available for public comment for a period of 90 days .the text of the bill is available from the government printer or can be downloaded from http : / / www.deat.gov.za / .the purpose of this guide is to facilitate meaningful and informed public participation during the 90 day comments period .the guide seeks to achieve this by first explaining the historical context leading to the publication in 2000 of the white paper for sustainable coastal development in south africa which provided a national policy for managing our coastline .this guide then briefly explains the purpose of each chapter of the bill and provides an outline of its content .when the bill becomes an act of parliament south africa will for the first time have a national coastal management act in place for managing our coastal zone , a priceless national asset .the publication of the bill for comment therefore represents a historical opportunity for coastal stakeholders , interested and affected parties and members of the general public to help shape the content of the proposed integrated coastal management act .why is there a need for a national coastal management act ?the questions are often raised ― why is there a need for dedicated coastal management legislation ― is the coast not simply part of the general environment and is it not already covered by existing environmental legislation ?answers to these questions are discussed below .the coast is a unique part of the environment .it is the meeting place of the land and sea ― a limited spatial area that supports many human activities .the coast is a distinctive system in which a range of considerations ― biophysical , economic , social and institutional ― interconnect , in a manner which requires a dedicated and integrated management approach .the coast needs to be managed as a system in order to make optimal use of the opportunities and benefits it provides .however , this system ― orientated approach has failed to materialize to date and various sectors of government continue to adopt a management approach focusing on their specific sectors such as land-use planning , agriculture , water affairs , nature conservation and others .this bill promotes a holistic way of thinking by promoting coordinated and integrated coastal management , which views the coast as a system and emphasizes the importance of managing it as such .in the past , the value of coastal ecosystems as a cornerstone for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in decision-making in south africa .the white paper highlights the importance of recognising the value of the coast .the value of the direct benefits obtained from coastal goods and services was estimated in 1998 to be about r168 billion annually , which was equivalent to about 35 of our annual gross domestic product .much of the wealth locked up in our coast continues to be wasted due to environmentally insensitive development and activities .economic and social opportunities for wealth creation and equity are being missed and coastal ecosystems are being degraded .photo : deatphoto : csir natural resources and the environmenthow we manage our coastal areas will determine whether they remain valuable assets or become degraded liabilities .the white paper also emphasizes the importance of facilitating coastal development which is sustainable .this requires development to be ecologically , socially and economically sustainable .for coastal development to be ecologically sustainable , it should involve protection of coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources .for coastal development to be socially sustainable , it should emphasise public awareness and shared responsibility , empowering disadvantaged individuals and communities , including women and the poor .for coastal development to be economically sustainable it should diversify opportunities , provide jobs and facilitate access to productive resources .the white paper did not merely provide a vision , principles , goals and objectives for coastal management in south africa .it took a step further by providing a plan of action which outlines in detail how the white paper is to be implemented .one of the elements of this plan of action is institutional and legal development .after the cabinet approved the white paper a comprehensive legal review was carried out .its purpose was to determine whether the white paper could be implemented in terms of existing laws .the review concluded that a dedicated coastal management act was required for implementing the white paper .the contents of the billpreamblethe preamble explains the rationale or basis for promulgating the proposed integrated coastal management act .several factors forming part of this basis are discussed above .chapter 1 : interpretation , objectives and application of actthis chapter defines important words and terms , sets out the objectives of the proposed act in order to guide the interpretation and application of the act , clarifies the role of the state in relation to the coastal environment , indicates to whom and where the act applies and explains that the act must be read in conjunction with the national environmental management act and explains how to reconcile conflicts with other legislation .chapter 2 : the coastal zonethe bill focuses on regulating human activities within , or that affect the coastal zone .the coastal zone is illustrated in figure 1 and defined as the area comprising coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , coastal access land , specially protected coastal areas , and includes any aspect of the environment on , in and above them .at the heart of the coastal zone is an area of land and water defined as coastal public property , which is the common property of the people of south africa .this contrasts with the current situation under the seashore act where the seashore and sea are owned by the president on behalf of the people.coastal public property is made up primarily of the seashore and coastal waters .die beperking of beheer van ontwikkeling in hierdie areas is ook noodsaaklik ten einde die dinamiese aard van die kus in ag te neem en om mense en eiendom te beskerm teen skade weens natuurlike oorsake , soos kuslynerosie en vloede , of nuwe bedreigings soos die styging van seevlakke as gevolg van aardverhitting .the bill provides that initially the coastal buffer zone would extend one hundred metres inland from the boundary of coastal public property in areas that have already been zoned for residential , commercial , industrial or multiple-use purposes , and one kilometre inland in other areas .for example , in developed areas where the coastal environment has been highly modified , such as durbans beachfront and sea point in cape town , the width of the coastal buffer zone could be reduced to less than 100 metres .in order to secure public access to coastal public property , the bill requires municipalities to designate coastal access land .certain land will be regarded as coastal access land when the bill is enacted but the designation of coastal access land may also be withdrawn or cancelled .reasons for withdrawing such designation could include instances where the use of coastal access land is causing damage to the environment .the process for designating or withdrawing the designation of coastal access land is described in section 19 .the responsibilities of municipalities with regard to coastal access land are described in section 20 .in the past infrastructure for access to the sea was often developed without sufficient consideration of environmental factors .early drafts of the integrated coastal management bill included detailed provisions dealing with coastal protected areas .however , it was decided that coastal protected areas would generally be managed under the protected areas act rather than the proposed integrated coastal management act .protected areas or parts thereof are automatically included in the buffer zone in terms of section 16 .the purpose of section 22 is to enable the mec to declare that protected areas or parts thereof are not part of the buffer zone .section 23 provides that special management areas may be declared and section 24 deals with the management of such areas .this is intended to provide a mechanism for establishing special management arrangements in a particular area in order to give effect to the recognition in the white paper that the diversity of the coast requires different management approaches in different areas .a special management area could be declared for various coastal management purposes , and it is envisaged that these would be established mainly to encourage sustainable development in particular areas , rather than as conservation areas .for example , special management areas could be declared to ensure the sustainable harvesting of shellfish for subsistence purposes in areas where such harvesting is presently depleting the shellfish resources .section 25 authorises mecs to establish coastal setback lines .once such a line has been established in a zoning scheme , any person who wishes to erect or alter a structure situated seaward of the line must obtain permission before doing so .a coastal setback line may , for example , be established to ensure that the shadows from high buildings do not fall on the beach or in order to take into account possible effects of sea level rise .chapter 3 : boundaries of coastal areasthis chapter provides procedures for demarcating and adjusting the boundaries of coastal public property , the coastal buffer zone , special management areas and coastal access land .it also sets out the considerations which must apply in respect of such demarcations and adjustments .demarcation procedures to change the boundaries of the coastal buffer zone are only likely to be instituted where the area designated by the act is inappropriate and impedes effective coastal management .a chapter of the bill focuses on estuaries which are much sought after for recreationthis chapter aims to facilitate the efficient and coordinated management of all estuaries by providing that they must be managed , in accordance with : athe protocol will provide a national policy for estuary management and guide the development of individual estuarine management plans .chapter 5 : institutional arrangementsthe white paper recommended new arrangements to coordinate coastal management in south africa .this chapter establishes a statutory framework for new institutional arrangements to ensure integrated and coordinated coastal management .section 35 establishes a national coastal committee which will function at national government level .section 36 authorizes the minister to determine the composition of the committee .section 37 provides for the designation and functions of provincial lead agencies which will play the lead role in coastal management at provincial government level .section 38 provides for the establishment of provincial coastal committees which will be responsible for coordinating coastal management in each province .section 39 authorizes the mecs of each province to determine the composition of these committees .section 40 authorizes the mecs to appoint voluntary coastal officers and define their roles and responsibilities .this provision helps facilitate a new cooperative and participatory approach to managing the coast by enhancing the participation of members of the public in coastal management .chapter 6 : coastal managementthis chapter establishes new management and planning procedures for coastal resources to ensure that development is sustainable , integrated and in the interest of all user groups .nationalprovincial coastalsets provincial coastal management policy and strategy consistent with management programmesnational cmp .includes : vision , provincial cmos .municipal coastalmay enact bylaws to give effect to municipal cmp .fig . 2 .in die bestaande provinsiale en munisipale landgebaseerde en ekonomiese ontwikkelingsprosedures integreer , op so ' n wyse dat dit ooreenstem met die beleidsdoelwitte van die witskrif .die hoofstuk vestig ' n hiërargie van kusbestuursprogramme .die kusprovinsies moet hulle eie provinsiale kbpe , wat in ooreenstemming is met die nasionale kbp en die nasionale riviermondingsbestuursprotokol , binne vier jaar vanaf die aanvang van die wet ontwikkel .these national , provincial and municipal cmps must include a vision for the management of the coastal zone they cover , set coastal management objectives and include priorities and strategies for achieving these and performance indicators that can be used to measure progress .section 49 requires the alignment of certain plans with cmps to ensure coordinated coastal management .similarly section 50 requires consistency between cmps and other statutory plans .in practice this means , for example , that the minister must ensure that there is consistency between the national coastal management plan and other national plans .procedures relating to public participation in respect of decision-making in accordance with the proposed act are set out in sections 51-52 .the powers of the minister and the mecs to review provincial and municipal cmps respectively are set out in sections 53-54 .section 55 gives the various authorities responsible for coastal management the power to establish zoning schemes .section 56 requires land use schemes prepared under other legislation to be consistent with coastal zoning schemes .the coastal resource use planning system established by this chapter will function as a mechanism for controlling the use of the coastal zone in the same way as the land use planning system is presently used .importantly , it will provide a mechanism for translating the results of research regarding how coastal resources should be used and the maximum use that should be made of coastal resources , into a legally enforceable system for managing the coastal zone .chapter 7 protection of coastal resourcesthis chapter provides measures for protecting the coastal environment from activities that may detrimentally affect it and creates procedures for assessing and regulating such activities .section 57 requires users of coastal public property , owners and occupiers of land , coastal managers and other responsible persons to take reasonable measures to avoid causing adverse effects on the coastal environment in accordance with section 28 of the national environmental management act , referred to below as nema .section 58 stipulates the requirements which apply to the authorisation of activities causing adverse effects .section 59 provides for the minister or mec to issue written notices requiring measures to be taken to protect the coastal environment .part 2 prohibits potentially harmful activities from taking place within the coastal buffer zone unless they have been specifically authorised and requires permits to be obtained before undertaking specified activities within this zone .the authorisation of activities is subject to the consideration of an environmental impact assessment .the bill does not seek to introduce new environmental impact assessment procedures .assessing the environmental impact of activities which may detrimentally affect the coastal zone will be done in terms of the general environmental impact assessment regulations which were promulgated in terms of nema on 21 april 2006 .part 3 prohibits the undertaking of certain activities within coastal public property and the exclusive economic zone without a permit .this part also provides strict guidelines for decision-making which the permit issuing authority must consider .section 68 is intended to facilitate the progressive development of an integrated and efficient procedure for granting permits for the use of coastal resources while maintaining a high level of environmental protection .this is achieved by providing that a single integrated coastal resource permit may be issued jointly by several organs of state instead of many separate authorisations .part 4 deals with the letting of coastal public property by way of coastal leases and the granting of limited use rights over coastal public property by way of coastal concessions .part 5 contains general provisions relating to the temporary occupation of land within the coastal zone for specified purposes and the amendment , suspension or cancellation of authorisations .such amendment , suspension or cancellation is subject to the criteria specified in section 73 .chapter 8 : marine and coastal pollution controlthe bill intends to regulate the discharge of effluent into coastal waters from any source on land by requiring permits to authorise such discharges .the bill also establishes a prohibition of incineration or dumping at sea of waste or other material .this prohibition prohibits incineration at sea and restricts dumping at sea in accordance with south africas obligations under international law .the bill provides procedures relating to both discharge and dumping permits .the bill authorises the minister to dispense with prescribed procedure in respect of dumping in emergencies .for example , vessels in distress due to mechanical failure may need to urgently dump cargo overboard .the bill requires the minister to develop a national action list to screen waste and other material on the basis of their potential effect on human health and the marine environment .chapter 9 : appealsthis chapter sets out the procedures to be followed when appealing against coastal protection or repair and removal notices or in connection with the granting or refusal of a permit under the act .it empowers the minister or mec either to consider the appeal personally or to appoint an appeal panel to determine the appeal .the purpose of a panel is to ensure that the consideration of an appeal is informed by technical expertise where this is required .pending the determination of an appeal , the minister or mec may make an interim order considered necessary to achieve the purposes of the act .chapter 10 : enforcementthis chapter establishes certain offences , determines penalties in respect of offences , provides for offences under the act to be prosecuted in the magistrates court and gives the minister , an mec or a municipality the power to institute legal proceedings or take other measures in relation to coastal public property or the coastal environment .chapter 11 : general ministerial powers and dutiesthis chapter sets out the powers and responsibilities of the minister and the mecs .part 1 deals with the powers of the minister and of mecs to make regulations to promote the acts implementation and prescribes the consultative process that is to be followed when making regulations .part 2 describes the powers to be exercised by the minister and mec .section 92 grants the minister the power to exercise certain functions normally exercised by the mec if specific circumstances apply .section 93 authorises the mec to issue directives to municipalities .part 3 deals with delegations .section 94 deals with delegations of powers or duties by the minister .section 95 authorises the minister to exercise certain duties and powers normally exercised by the mec under certain circumstances .section 96 deals with the mecs powers to delegate powers or duties assigned to the mec .part 4 deals with certain general matters .section 97 deals with information and reporting on coastal matters .the minister must make certain information concerning the protection and management of the coastal zone available to the public .the responsibilities of the minister and mecs to prepare reports on the state of the coastal environment are also set out .section 98 requires the coordination of actions between provinces and municipalities .chapter 12 miscellaneous mattersthis chapter deals with a variety of matters in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the previous management system to the one proposed by the bill .these include provisions dealing with the continuation of existing leases on , or rights to , coastal public property , the procedures for dealing with unlawful structures on coastal public property , and the continuation of existing lawful activities in the coastal buffer zone that were lawful before the commencement of the act but that after its commencement may only be conducted with a permit .it also deals with other matters such as the repeal and amendment of other laws .one of the benefits of the proposed act is that it will replace three existing acts completely and will repeal provisions in the nature conservation act , 1987 of the former ciskei and the environmental conservation decree , 1992 of the former transkei .costs and benefitsthe implementation of the act will involve some additional costs to organs of state within the national , provincial and local spheres of government .these will be primarily related to the new function of preparing comprehensive coastal management programmes .however these costs should be dwarfed by the benefits derived from improved allocation of coastal resources and streamlined management systems .if enacted will the bill provide an adequate new integrated coastal management act ?some questions to consider when submitting commentssupport the new holistic coordinated and integrated coastal management approach that is central to the white paper ?ensure that our coast will remain a valuable national asset ?enhance the ability of each sphere of government to perform their existing coastal management functions and facilitate the further assignment of coastal management responsibilities where appropriate ?avoid or minimise the establishment of new institutions as recommended by the white paper ?facilitate the establishment of a range of public / private and other partnerships for the management of areas of the coastal zone based on the recognition that the great diversity of coastal land forms and circumstances that exist along our coast require correspondingly diverse management systems ?provide a legal basis for applying the principles and achieving the goals and objectives set out in the white paper ?enable the development of national , provincial and municipal coastal planning systems to regulate the development and use of the coast ?ensure the protection of our coasts historical , cultural and ecological integrity ?adjust public and private rights to own and use the coast to ensure that they do not conflict with the implementation of the policy in the white paper ?promote equitable access to opportunities and benefits arising from the use of the coast ?enhance public rights to use the seashore and balance these with corresponding duties ?provide for the use of economic instruments , as recommended in the white paper , to support the achievement of the policy objectives ?generally or specifically give adequate legal effect to the policy in the white paper ?it is also important to be aware of the fact that this draft legislation has been prepared in the context of a wider environmental law reform programme being undertaken by the department of environmental affairs and tourism .one of the objectives of the environmental law reform process is to establish an integrated and internally consistent system of environmental laws for south africa .accordingly , the act has been drafted in a manner that will enable it to be implemented in conjunction with other environmental and land-use planning legislation .recommended readingscouncil for the environment . 1989 .a policy for coastal zone

lekkasies en gebarste of verstopte pype aan te meld .drinking water qualitywater servicedrinking water quality in cape townthe quality of drinking water in cape town is of a high standard .this is due to the fact that most of the water consumed in cape town is abstracted largely from unpolluted mountain catchments .our scientific services department is equipped with some of the most sophisticated water testing instrumentation in the water industry .this , plus a highly skilled and experienced group of scientists and technicians guarantees that the water which is supplied to the consumer is of acceptable quality .the city of cape town is committed to providing quality tap water to its consumers .every effort is made to meet the highest international standards for drinking water .our scientific services department performs numerous tests on water samples which are taken from water treatment plants , service reservoirs and from various points within the distribution system .these tests must meet the recommended guidelines which are laid down in the south african national standards for drinking water .most frequently asked questionshow frequently does water get tested ?quality of the water to consumers is monitored weekly throughout the year at various points at the treatment plants and within the distribution network in the cape metropolitan area .is cape town water recycled ?no , we do not drink recycled water but , we do recycle water for other uses such as industrial and irrigation purposes that do not require potable water .why is my water sometimes white when i open the tap ?this is a harmless phenomenon and it is caused by presence of air bubbles .the bubbles are as a result of high pressure in the distribution pipes that transport water to your home .allow the glass to stand for a while and air bubbles will escape .why does my water taste and / or smell funny ?a swimming pool smell is caused by chlorine which is added to your water to kill bacteria .an earthy smell is caused by a harmless substance called geosmin .geosmin is produced by small water plants called algae which may be present in rivers and dams at certain times of the year , e.g. summer .is chlorine present in my water and why is it added ?chlorine is a disinfectant and kills bacteria in water .chlorine has been used as a disinfectant as far back as the late nineteenth century .it has gained popularity throughout the world as an antibacterial agent .the presence of chlorine in piped waters has prevented and wiped out waterborne diseases such as typhoid , cholera and dysentery in many parts of the world .in south africa it is added to drinking water to ensure the prevention of bacterial re-growth in the holding water reservoirs and the network of pipes that transport water from treatment plants to your home .the levels of chlorines are such that they are maintained from supply point right up to your home tap .is it better to drink bottled water than tap water ?there is no reason why people should drink bottled water in cape town .some people may choose to drink bottled water due to health reasons or taste preference .with no presence of disinfectant , water can be contaminated and bacteria can accumulate during storage .this happens mostly after bottling and while water stands on the shop shelf .to provide a

of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2007 Madam Speaker of the National Assembly ; Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament ; Ministers and Deputy Ministers ; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary ; Heads of our Security Services ; Governor of the Reserve Bank ; President Nelson Mandela and Madame Graca Machel ; Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces ; Mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; Our honoured traditional leaders ; Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; Directors-General and other leaders of the public service ; Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners ; Distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; People of South Africa : When she died , we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital . But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion . But that was not to be . Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains . Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year , we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband , the father of her children , her companion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , Oliver Reginald Tambo . Once more , we convey our condolences to the Tambo family . His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today . I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli , and the Order of the Companions of O.R . I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Orders . I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Womens March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the Presidents box , as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today . The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today , as I have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the General Elections of that year . At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month , the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections . Having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves ― what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 ! With your indulgence , I would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day , the 10th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic , whom our Parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections . On that occasion we said in part : For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse . It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage It was a place in which squalor , the stench of poverty , the open sewers , the decaying rot , the milling crowds of wretchedness , the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse , assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets , and wooded lanes , and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass , and birds and houses fit for kings and queens , and lyrical music , and love . It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others , guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living , who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause . It was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls , electrified fences , guard dogs , police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters , with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters We have gathered here today , on Freedom Day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say ― an end to all that ! We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people , regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty . The work to create that South Africa has begun . That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom . Fifty years before , as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People , which adopted the Freedom Charter , the patriots of the day had said , Let us speak together , all of us together ― African and European , Indian and Coloured all the people of South Africa Let us speak together of freedom . And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . We must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action ― enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society ! We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa . Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream , our government committed itself , working with all South Africans , to implement detailed programmes intended : to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy ; to improve our export performance , focussing on services and manufactured goods ; to increase spending on scientific research and development ; to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy ; to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment ; to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation ; to expand access to such services as water , electricity and sanitation ; to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole ; to intensify the housing programme ; to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture ; to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities ; to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth , reconstruction and development of our country ; to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent ; increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world . At an average of over 4,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 . Investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8 . Today , fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product ― at about 18,4 ― is at its highest since 1991 . The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years . We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy . From owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low . The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us . The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ; and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery . But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs . While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations . The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries . Over the past three years , the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs . It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone , 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 . A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme . But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly . There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises . And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs . It is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage . While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004 , today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants . It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity . This will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities . The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years . However , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected . We must act to change this situation . As Honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport . These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started , the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system . These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , combining both road and rail . We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . Access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved . By 2005 , South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 . According to the United Nations Development Programme , South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation . In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006 : South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy Rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid , partly through rights-based entitlements . We should indeed celebrate this great achievement . But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . Many more are without electricity and sanitation . We are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half . We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year . We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace . This applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates . The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement . At the same time , the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 . We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme . While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex . On the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution . We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up . All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people . The work done during the course of last year , by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some defects in our systems in this regard . From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things : Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country ; Develop a proper database of households living in poverty ; Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ; Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty ; In this context , address all indigence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication ; Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored . This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market . In the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage . A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion . In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities , the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC , the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society , in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation . Further , on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers , we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together ! In other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay , and work to attain the happiness that comes with it . Madame Speaker and Chairperson ; I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime . In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said : Promoting peace and security will involve all people . It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected Peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . Certainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , closeted behind walls and barbed wire , ever anxious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces . Obviously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime . While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security . While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted . And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level . The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector . Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate . This applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel vetting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles , and so on . This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met . We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs . And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure , improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented . Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . As such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda . What has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants . Compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed . Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent . In this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial . Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace . Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new . What is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions . The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros . These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year . It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February . This will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development . I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative , working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team , concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system . We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole . This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . In this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year : complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ; in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed , we will : intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing , tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ; develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation , agriculture and agro-processing , the white goods sector , creative industries , community and social services and pharmaceuticals . This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a State Diamond Trader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers . We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ; With regard to communications , I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers . In addition , Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector . These centres will be established in areas identified by government . The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries . We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the Regulatory Impact Assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities . The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans . Starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions . At the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system . We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification . After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . In this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training institutes and others . As the Honourable Members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools . In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever . We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing . Quite clearly , in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy . Because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things : take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ; ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency , SEDA ; process the Companies Bill , adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday , as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ; having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings ; intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work , including a youth cooperatives programme , and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities ― and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies , public and private , big and small , which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative ; start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers . Honourable Members ; The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society . For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society . A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa . This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people . The principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity . This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes . In the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include : continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system ; a wage subsidy for low-wage employees , possibly directed at first entrants into the job market , especially young people ; a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings , death , disability and unemployment benefits . The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech . What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC . In addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years . Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : Geen pogings om die openbare orde ter wille van selfsugtige eiebelang omver te werp , sal geduld word nie . ensuring the implementation , without further delay , of measures to reduce the cost of medicines ; continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of TB , road accidents and violent crime . In this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment . We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible . This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 . All these efforts , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security . In this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented . The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies . Rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system . The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security . In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution ; implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations ; utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service , in order massively to reduce case backlogs ; finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning , in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy ; implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections ; continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws ; improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating . In this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention . As we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals . In this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens . I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums . Further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency . To achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres , including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system ; complete , within the next 18 months , legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards , remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions ; intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development , while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres ; conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government , as well as the Offices of the Premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; while intensifying the public sector and national anticorruption campaign , complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anticorruption strategies for all spheres of government ; roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational ; further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership . Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation . In this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 . As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africas first national panel study , the National Income Dynamics Study . These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution . I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings . Madame Speaker and Chairperson : Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region . We are proud , as South Africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba . We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC , as well as Burundi , the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development . However , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in Sudan , including the situation in Darfur , Côte dIvoire and Somalia . Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia . Critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation . This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country . I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government Ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy . We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process . Similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes . Just over a month ago , South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . We hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of South Africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine , Israel , Iraq , Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf . We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in India , Brazil and the Peoples Republic of China , other countries of the South , as well as Japan , Europe and North America . One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations . We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition . Madame Speaker , Chairperson and Honourable Members ; Since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better . We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront . But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society . We should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom . We should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . We are not there yet . But no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . And so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share . Thank you . Issued by : The Presidency February 2007  State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki : Joint Sitting of Parliament February 2008 Mr Jacob Zuma , Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress ; Chairperson of SALGA , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ; Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year . I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all . I say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream . And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today . I speak here today in the presence of my mother , Epainette Mbeki , MaMofokeng , who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei , among whom she has lived for many decades . She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today . In eight days time , on February 16 , she will be 92 years old . What she expects as her birthday present is the truth . I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her . I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year . We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman , representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include Nelson Mandela . We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner , the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago . We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , Robert Sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , banishment and other forms of repression . We acknowledge , both among the Honourable Members and our guests , the many founders of the United Democratic Front , 25 years ago . All these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans . Indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people . We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections . The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 . I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 . However , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . Happily , this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which , the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week . The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people . The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― Business Unusual !We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later . To make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities . The main categories of these priorities are : the further acceleration of our economic growth and development speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy , and poverty eradication enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and , enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations . More than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands ! As we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― Business Unusual ! As I was preparing this Address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow . He suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel , A Tale of Two Cities . And so I quote these words : It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . You will ask whether I agree with this assessment , whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future ! My answer to this question is a definite No !Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place . They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people . Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation . However , like all the Honourable Members , I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow . They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity . They are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor . Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States . They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices . This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police , the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month . While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous South Africa . Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom . Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution . The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges . And precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity ! In this regard , I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American , Cynthia Carroll , when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week , on Tuesday , February 5 . As the Honourable Members know , she said : I dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . And South Africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil . Sure , the problems here are serious ; overcoming them will require ingenuity , especially in energy efficiency and energy saving , as well as the development of alternative power supplies . But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― I hope relatively unscathed This is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions . This having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding . I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties . In the past two weeks , the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation . Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters . In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream . The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy . In this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin . As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge . Among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient . There are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take . These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another . Die Regering sal begin met die implementering van ’n veldtog om doeltreffende beligting te verseker , asook watervehitting deur middel van sonkrag , die beheer van die las van warmwatertoestelle in huishoudings , insluitend behuisingstandaarde vir alle nuwe huise en ontwikkelings . An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not . On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency . We are taking steps to enhance Eskoms maintenance capacity . We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects . All these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin . The massive Eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; and where possible , some projects will be accelerated . In this regard , I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can . In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric during the course of last week , GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf . In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol , Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint . The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination . I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January . We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry . Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency . Task teams are currently working in many areas . Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country . They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings , Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency . The Department of Provincial and Local Government will coordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises . The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme . We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period . This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end . However , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity . We are a minerals resource economy . We must therefore continue to support the mining industry . It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient . Indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity . Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid . Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual ! This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today . I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully . Of course , I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament . The sense that we get , across all sectors of South African society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - Business Unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !We must ensure that we sustain this approach . We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud . I am certain that the South African Football Association , our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud . Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year . This must inspire Bafana Bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year . Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned . Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan . Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation . In this regard , R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy . Working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing . Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained . At the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability . To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency . This entails coordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location . Cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right . Accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco . Already , money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation . Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables . At the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year . Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of Business Unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes . An element of governments Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development . Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition will be intensified . Indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills . In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates . Further , after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign . This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 . Madame Speaker and Chairperson At the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans , acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all . In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme . Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves . Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge . These include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly . Among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors . Among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment . Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 . But we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be . In any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated . As such , in the spirit of Business Unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households . For this , we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development , Provincial and Local Government , Trade and Industry , Agriculture and Land Affairs , Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency . Die oudit van grondeienaarskap sal ook bespoedig word . intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to cooperatives and small enterprises especially those involving women , with emphasis on providing training and markets , including linking them up with established outlets ; scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the Military Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme ; Die uitbreiding van die openbare werke-program , wat , deur die vasgestelde doelwitte te oortref , die potensiaal getoon het om meer nuwelinge te absorber . About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP ; introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small , medium and micro-enterprises ; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed . We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services . Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS . We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment . We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners . As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation . Two such issues deserve brief mention . The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans . The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters . The second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose . We will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees . Madame Speaker and Chairperson , When we reflected on the issue of crime at last years Joint Sitting of Parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy . Accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality . In this regard , in the spirit of Business Unusual , Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system . Among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the Legal Aid Board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums . As the Honourable Members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; but we are certain that , if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner , the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime . The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week . Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the Criminal Justice System , we shall by the end of March this year , interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime . What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies . Of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements . If anything , the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants . There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . Firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging . The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision . Secondly , by May of every year all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities . The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . Thirdly , recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by Cabinet . This includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card . Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management . Further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement . In this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided . Working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second National anticorruption Programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . At local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies . We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda . To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done . In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment . Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning . Thus , as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government . The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism . Our focus , in promoting the African Agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the African institutions , including the African Union and its development programme , Nepad . This we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels . A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration . We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community , and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard . It is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union , within the context of the process led by the African Union , to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible , premised on accelerating the development of our region . Over the past year , we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face . We had an opportunity , on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter . In short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address . These include issues relating to the Constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years . The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments . What is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution . Accordingly , we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter . As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations . At the same time , we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March . Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme . Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya , Chad , Burundi , Darfur in the Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia , the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability . We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments . We will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council . Critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union . Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums , the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement . In the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round . This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Peoples Republic of China . The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength . Next year , South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001 . We are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives . These global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup , bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity . But we should not take this for granted . I am confident that , under the leadership of the International Marketing Council , Trade and Investment South Africa , Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africas humanity in 2010 . What I do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course ! I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided . With all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels . Issued by : The Presidency February 2008  State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the joint sitting of Parliament , Cape Town February 2009 Madam Deputy President ; Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces ; Chief Justice Langa ; The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC ; The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament ; Your Excellencies , Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ; Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament , Traditional leaders ; Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town ; Religious leaders and representatives of civil society ; I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa , at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament . I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President . Mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running . That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the Executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers . As we look back over the past fifteen years , I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the Executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary ; driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans . Above all , I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today ― worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life . These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation . Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell . They include Brian Bunting , Billy Nair , Ncumisa Kondlo , John Gomomo , Joe Nhlanhla , Cas Saloojee , John Schippers and Jan van Eck . To these , I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman , a truly distinguished South African , who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old . It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― our nation is in a good state . However , we should not underestimate the challenges we face . The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people . Naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers . As a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult . But ours is a journey of hope and resilience . Our democracy is healthy . It is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world . Indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy . It is South Africas people who have ensured its progress ; and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come . Allow me , Madame Speaker and Chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves . This we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed . But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa tomorrow and Sunday , the 7th and 8th of February respectively . I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections . We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who , on 27 April 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands . Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all . It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August , 1989 ― commonly known as the Harare Declaration . That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the United Nations , on the approach to negotiations in South Africa . Within South Africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life . All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 . In this regard , we should salute the late President of the African National Congress , Oliver Reginald Tambo , for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country . That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa . While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion . Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance . In this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom . Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu , brother of Kalushi , representing the Mahlangu family . Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands . A hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts . In the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership . A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students Organisation 40 years ago . Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO , which included : Strini Moodley , Professor Barney Pityana , Steve Biko , Onkgopotse Tiro , Harry Nengwekhulu , Themba Sono , Mapetla Mohapi , Mosioua Lekota , Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi . For inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them . In this regard , we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiros cousin , Pat Tlhagwana . In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale , the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students , and his peers . In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth . The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ; that we should indeed , in the words of the Freedom Charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture ! We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ; We do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy . Over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance . We have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them . Indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society . However , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves . At the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections . We hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour ! Though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves . On both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind . Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the Department of Home Affairs , firm leadership . However , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public . As Honourable Members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus . This is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines . The same challenges confront the private sector . I am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole . It is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 . In the First Decade of Freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 . While the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward . These include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors . In this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product . Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 . This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure . It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ; and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability . The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact . It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner . Our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system . Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms . Yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations . Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports . Except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing . As such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries . It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth . And because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes . These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward . Of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?Wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life . Thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations . Importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work . In this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . Of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy . Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment . This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda . In reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential . The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes . Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods . Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage . I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage . To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch , led by Professor Servaas van der Berg : Firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century . The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards . Thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved . On a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe : The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years . Indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among African and Coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants . While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million . This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant , which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 . As part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate . This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality . With regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves . and sanitation . Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities . Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ; and malaria cases have massively declined . We are also heartened that research into HIV prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection . Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity . In some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement . In education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ; At the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas . Of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society . In addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past . Ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive . Governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided . We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better . Overall , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes . But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change . Be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !On this we still have some way to go . The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans . Daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack . Within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern Of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined . All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this . But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime . This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime . It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . These are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address . Yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country . This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability . But let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nascent stages . We still have a long way to go . I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society . In this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly . Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ; and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns . It is a matter of proud record that , for instance , female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ; and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition . Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability . HIV impacts most severely on young women . Violence against women and children is much too high . All these are assignments for the coming period . Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson ; There is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive . But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense . It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former President Nelson Mandela , in his biography , Long Walk to Freedom : I have walked that long road to freedom . I have made missteps along the way . But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . I have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance I have come . But I can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and I dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended . In a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy . While our approaches may differ , the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our Constitution : to create a united , nonracial , nonsexist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world . Six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 . addressing the investment challenge by improving savings , appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds , housing , financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment ; die bevordering van gelykheid , die ontwikkeling van vaardighede , die skep van ekonomiese geleenthede en die uitbreiding van dienste , I am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ; to provide efficient , decent and equitable health care ; and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption . I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society . Rather , I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of visions . Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals . And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village . What , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade . We can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis . We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems . Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society . What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis . But we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ; access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse ; lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production ; the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality . These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high . Combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects . As such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation . We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries . Indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate . In this regard , Honourable Members , I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society . Firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years . In this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds . This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds . Secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes . On the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue . On the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme . Thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants . On its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis . Alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing . This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports . Fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men . In addition , we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits . We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations . In this regard , we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book . We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population . These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy . However , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable . This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better . Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation . Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe . Critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down . In our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path . The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat . But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later . In this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance . I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now . Virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion ― from stadia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans ― confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament . And we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations ! But beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity ― to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world . We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africas pursuit of excellence over the past year . Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings . We are of course Rugby World Champions ; Giniel de Villiers and his team have won the Dakar Rally ; our Paralympians continue to do us proud ; and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment . Just two weeks ago , South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu . This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africas wealth . This initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition . Indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century . It is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country . We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face . We are truly heartened that , yesterday , the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government . Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator , former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion . In this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country . We are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail . We are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable . The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ; but , hopefully , also with regard to political dialogue . In the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi , Sudan , Western Sahara , Côte dIvoire , Somalia and elsewhere . As would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months , South Africa will use the privilege of chairing SADC to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion . te versterk eerder as te verswak . We will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity . We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China . Over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership . We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA ; and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia , and countries in Asia , the Middle East , as well as Latin and North America . We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular . The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description . There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery . And we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories . Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development . We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership ; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region . We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-EU Summit later this year . Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner . We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world . Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ; and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays . In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate . As part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments Programme of Action , we will pay particular attention to : creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government , including national strategic planning ; continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way ; implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country ; continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System , including the matter of National Health Insurance ; intensifying the campaign to save energy , so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour , while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources ― recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change , resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing ; integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ; intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system , including better forensic capacity , rapid increase in the number of detectives , optimal utilisation of information and communications technology , and better management of the courts ; and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy , preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament , and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency ; and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Childrens Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60 . These and other programmes , including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February , form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future . We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us . This , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state . It is steadily growing stronger . And so , in the words of former President Mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended . I thank you . Issued by : The Presidency February 2009  state of the nation address of the president of south africa , thabo mbeki : joint sitting of parliament february 2007 madam speaker of the national assembly ; chairperson of the national council of provinces ; honourable leaders of our political parties and honourable members of parliament ; ministers and deputy ministers ; our esteemed chief justice and members of the judiciary ; heads of our security services ; governor of the reserve bank ; president nelson mandela and madame graca machel ; distinguished premiers and speakers of our provinces ; mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; our honoured traditional leaders ; heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy ; directors-general and other leaders of the public service ; your excellencies , ambassadors and high commissioners ; distinguished guests , friends and comrades ; people of south africa : when she died , we knew that mama adelaide tambo had been recently discharged from hospital . but because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living , we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion . but that was not to be . tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains . thus she will only be with us in spirit when in october this year , we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband , the father of her children , her companion , her comrade , and an eminent son of our people , oliver reginald tambo . once more , we convey our condolences to the tambo family . his death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today . i feel immensely proud that democratic south africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what albert luthuli and oliver tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our national orders after them - the order of luthuli , and the order of the companions of o.r . i also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent national orders . i am also pleased to welcome to the house the activists of the 1956 womens march and the 1976 soweto uprising who are sitting in the presidents box , as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces , proposed by our provincial speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today . the government of the people of south africa on whose behalf i speak here today , as i have been privileged to do in previous years , was formed in 2004 , after the general elections of that year . at its annual january lekgotla or bosberaad last month , the national cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside , reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last , 2004 , elections . having understood this , it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves ― what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed , as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009 ! with your indulgence , i would like to step further back , and recall what we said , in 2004 , as representatives of our people , in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world , convened at our seat of government the union buildings in tshwane on freedom day , the 10th anniversary of our liberation , and participated in the inauguration of the president of the republic , whom our parliament had chosen , respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections . on that occasion we said in part : for too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society it was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse . it was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage it was a place in which squalor , the stench of poverty , the open sewers , the decaying rot , the milling crowds of wretchedness , the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse , assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets , and wooded lanes , and flowers blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass , and birds and houses fit for kings and queens , and lyrical music , and love . it was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others , guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living , who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst , and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause . it was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls , electrified fences , guard dogs , police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters , with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters we have gathered here today , on freedom day , because in time , our people , together with the billions of human beings across the globe , who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent , decided to say ― an end to all that ! we are greatly encouraged that our general elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people , regardless of race , colour and ethnicity , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty . the work to create that south africa has begun . that work will continue during our second decade of freedom . fifty years before , as they prepared to convene the congress of the people , which adopted the freedom charter , the patriots of the day had said , let us speak together , all of us together ― african and european , indian and coloured all the people of south africa let us speak together of freedom . and of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . we must today renew our pledge , to speak together of freedom , to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty , to work together to build a south africa defined by a common dream , to say , together , in action ― enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society ! we must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office , fully conscious that none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , and therefore that the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new south africa . responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the south africa defined by a common dream , our government committed itself , working with all south africans , to implement detailed programmes intended : to raise the rate of investment in the first economy ; to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the second economy ; to accelerate the process of renewal of the african continent ; at an average of over 4,5 , the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994 . investment in the economy , by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11 , with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8 . today , fixed investment as a percentage of gross domestic product ― at about 18,4 ― is at its highest since 1991 . the number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years . we have seen steady progress in the advancement of black people in the economy . from owning just over 3 of the market capitalisation of the jse in 2004 , this has increased to close on to 5 ; and the proportion of blacks in top management has grown from 24 of the total to 27 . yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low . the advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us . the massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population ; but our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs . while household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income , the fact that south africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations . the continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries . over the past three years , the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs . it is encouraging that in the year march 2005 to march 2006 alone , 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture , representing a growth rate of about 4 . a small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the expanded public works programme . but there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly . there is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises . and given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth , we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the national youth service and the development of young entrepreneurs . it is a matter of pride that , in line with our commitment to build a caring society , we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage . while beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004 , today 11 million poor south africans have access to these grants . it is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have , in the recent period , been within manageable ranges , as the programmes reach maturity . this will ensure sustainability , and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities . the housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years . however , as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way , the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected . we must act to change this situation . as honourable members are aware , we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport . these include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the moloto rail corridor in mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started , the klipfontein corridor in cape town and the gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system . these and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy , combining both road and rail . we will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people . access to electricity , water and sanitation has improved . by 2005 , south africa had already achieved the millennium development goal in respect of basic water supply , with improvement of access from 59 in 1994 to 83 in 2006 . according to the united nations development programme , south africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation . in the words of the undp human development report of 2006 : south africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid , partly through rights-based entitlements . we should indeed celebrate this great achievement . but it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water . many more are without electricity and sanitation . we are proud that within one year , we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half . we are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year . we will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . an examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004 , though at a slow pace . this applies to literacy levels , gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates . the fluctuating matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement . at the same time , the number of matric students who pass mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995 . we also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the adult basic education programme . while the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period , we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases , many of which are much more complex . on the other hand , very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution . we will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up . all these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people . the work done during the course of last year , by women through the south african women in dialogue working with various government departments , including a visit to countries such as tunisia and chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty , does point to some defects in our systems in this regard . from the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things : define clearly the poverty matrix of our country ; develop a proper database of households living in poverty ; identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households ; monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty ; in this context , address all indigence , especially the high numbers of women so affected ; co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication ; accelerate the training of family social workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored . this will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities , continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market . in the meantime , we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage . a critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all south africans to improve social cohesion . in this year of the 60th anniversary of the doctors pact of leaders of african and indian communities , the 30th anniversary of the murder of steve biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to dakar by afrikaner intellectuals to meet the anc , the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to south africa needs to be better canvassed across society , in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation . further , on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of the world and the weekend world newspapers , we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging , reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together ! in other words , measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone . we must together as south africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay , and work to attain the happiness that comes with it . madame speaker and chairperson ; i am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime . in the 1994 rdp white paper we said : promoting peace and security will involve all people . it will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected peace and political stability are also central to the governments efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness , drug trafficking , gun running , crime and especially the abuse of women and children . certainly , we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear , closeted behind walls and barbed wire , ever anxious in their houses , on the streets and on our roads , unable freely to enjoy our public spaces . obviously , we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime . while we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the south african police service , and while we have improved the training programme , we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security . while we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes , the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery , assault and murder is still below the 7-10 that we had targeted . and the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level . the increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector . quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate . this applies to such issues as wage levels , personnel vetting systems , enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles , and so on . this is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year , so that , in addition to improving the work of the police , we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public , in which huge resources are expended , are actually met . we will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts , to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs . and we will ensure that decisions to expand the correctional services infrastructure , improve the management of border control as well as the immigration and documentation services , among others , are implemented . many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation . as such , in the period leading up to 2009 , the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda . what has emerged , among others , as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the sa management development institute which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants . compliance levels within departments , in relation to public service and finance management legislation , have been somewhat mixed . obviously this cannot be allowed to continue , even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent . in this regard , the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial . programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace . immediately after the march 2006 local government elections , induction programmes were conducted , taking into account that 62 of the mayors are new . what is of concern , though , is that in many of these municipalities , many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions . the programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government is continuing , with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros . these pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year . it is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their growth and development summits , and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of february . this will lay the basis for cooperation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development . i would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to deputy president phumzile mlambo-ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the accelerated and shared growth initiative , working with the ministers and premiers who constitute the task team , concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption , as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system . we highly appreciate the contribution of all members of the executive and our public service managers , across the three spheres of government , in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole . this is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty . in this regard , in order further to speed up the implementation of asgisa , over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past , government will this year : complete the process of reviewing the countrys experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the exchange rate , inflation and interest rates , so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets , and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers ; in line with the national industrial policy framework which has now been completed , we will : intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in business process outsourcing , tourism , bio-fuels and chemicals , and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper , clothing and textiles , metals and engineering ; this must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods . with regard to mineral beneficiation for instance , we will set up a state diamond trader that will purchase 10 of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers . we are happy that debeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management , technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years ; with regard to communications , i am pleased to announce that the department of communications together with the mobile telephone companies and telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers . in addition , telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons , as part of the effort to expand the bpo sector . these centres will be established in areas identified by government . the special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries . we will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy , among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment , including practical introduction of the regulatory impact assessment system , developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity , finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators , and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities . the progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of further education and training colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans . starting this year , resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need , who enter these institutions . at the same time , we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the fet system . we do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people , that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification . after intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities , agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided . in this regard , we wish to commend the role played by the joint initiative on skills acquisition , which brings together government , business , labour , training institutes and others . as the honourable members know , we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools . in carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 fifa world cup is the best ever . we wish in this regard to congratulate our local organising committee and other partners for the sterling work they are doing . quite clearly , in order to ensure that all south africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy , these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the second economy . because of this , during the course of this year , we will among other things : take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the apex fund and the agricultural micro-credit fund ; ensure the proper functioning of the small enterprises development agency , seda ; process the companies bill , adopted for public comment by cabinet last wednesday , as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small , medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees ; having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves , we will increase the number of young people engaged in the national youth service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard , enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives , and employ 5 000 young people as part of the expanded public works programme in the maintenance of government buildings ; start implementing the communal land rights act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land , while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation , seeds and implements to small and cooperative farmers . honourable members ; the economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of south africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society . for us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society . a critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 report of the committee of inquiry into a comprehensive system of social security in south africa . this is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people . the principle guiding this approach is that , over and above social assistance provided through the government budget , we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity . this will mean that all south africans will enjoy membership of a common , administratively efficient social insurance system , while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes . in the discussions thus far conducted within government , consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include : the minister of finance will further elaborate on these issues in the budget speech . what we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation , government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through nedlac . in addition , we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years . our programme in the social sector for this year will also include : geen pogings om die openbare orde ter wille van selfsugtige eiebelang omver te werp , sal geduld word nie . continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases , malaria , the various strains of tb , road accidents and violent crime . in this regard , government commits itself to intensify the campaign against hiv and aids and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention , home-based care and treatment . we shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened , and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against aids and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible . this year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008 , sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012 . all these efforts , madame speaker and chairperson , must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security . in this regard , government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented . the challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies . rather , what is required is effective organisation , mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement , intelligence and corrections officers , and functionaries of the justice system . the overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families , in defence of our freedom and our security . in addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing , government will this year : bring the operations of the department of home affairs to full capacity , by filling vacant posts , improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the task team that has been working with the minister to improve the work of this vital institution ; implement the recommendations of the khampepe commission on the mandate and operations of the directorate of special operations ; implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the white paper on corrections ; continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies , and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our constitution and laws ; in this regard , we must respond to the cold reality that , as in other countries , the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention . as we have already said , these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police , to make life more and more difficult for the criminals . in this regard , we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground , and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime . government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work , and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens . i should mention in this regard that the ministry of safety and security and the police service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important community police forums . further to improve its service to the people , government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency . to achieve these objectives , we will during the course of this year : conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in provincial departments responsible for local government , as well as the offices of the premiers , while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments ; roll out the batho pele campaign at local government level , intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more multipurpose community centres beyond the 90 currently operational ; improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation . in this regard , two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007 . as of two days ago 6 000 field workers from statistics south africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a community survey , which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country . in october another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in south africas first national panel study , the national income dynamics study . these 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time , to further our understanding of such issues such as migration , labour market transitions , inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution . i wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings . madame speaker and chairperson : among the greatest achievements of the peoples of africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the great lakes region . we are proud , as south africans , of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about ― from the young men and women in our national defence force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the african dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of patrice lumumba . we will continue to work with the sister people of the drc , as well as burundi , the comoros and sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development . however , while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development , we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict , particularly the general peace process in sudan , including the situation in darfur , côte divoire and somalia . our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits , to the call of the african union for assistance to the people and government of somalia . critical in this regard , are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable , based on the need to achieve national reconciliation . this year the african peer review forum will complete its review of our country . i wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators , government ministers and departments , our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy . we will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process . similarly , we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the nepad programmes . just over a month ago , south africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the united nations security council . we hereby wish to pledge , on behalf of the people of south africa , that we will , in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies , do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security . in this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of palestine , israel , iraq , iran and other countries in the middle east and the persian gulf . we shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent , our partners in india , brazil and the peoples republic of china , other countries of the south , as well as japan , europe and north america . one of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the doha development round of wto negotiations . we are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found , and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition . madame speaker , chairperson and honourable members ; since the popular mandate of 2004 , we have made welcome progress in further changing south africa for the better . we should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront . but the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that , working together , we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all , in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society . we should today , even more confidently , speak together of freedom . we should dare to act in concert to pursue the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free . we are not there yet . but no one , except ourselves , shall ensure that this dream is realised . and so , let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work , fully understanding that the task to build the south africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share . thank you . issued by : the presidency february 2007  state of the nation address of the president of south africa , thabo mbeki : joint sitting of parliament february 2008 mr jacob zuma , former deputy president of the republic and president of the african national congress ; chairperson of salga , mayors and leaders in our system of local government ; chairperson of the national house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders ; allow me on this occasion of the penultimate joint sitting of the third parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation , to wish all the honourable members of parliament a happy and productive new year . i am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy , as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all . i say this because , in our own estimation , it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream . and such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today . i speak here today in the presence of my mother , epainette mbeki , mamofokeng , who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the transkei , among whom she has lived for many decades . she says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders , that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country , whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today . in eight days time , on february 16 , she will be 92 years old . what she expects as her birthday present is the truth . i thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today , and trust that we will not disappoint her . i would also like to take this opportunity to salute president nelson mandela , one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy , who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 july this year . we welcome to this occasion mr arthur margeman , representing the veterans of the alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago , who include nelson mandela . we are also privileged to have among us ms jann turner , the daughter of rick turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago . we are also pleased that we have among us mr dinilesizwe sobukwe , son of the outstanding patriot and leader , robert sobukwe , who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment , banishment and other forms of repression . we acknowledge , both among the honourable members and our guests , the many founders of the united democratic front , 25 years ago . all these honoured guests , representing both memory and hope , remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all south africans . indeed , they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people , and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people . we are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections . the government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004 . i am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004 . however , and not unexpectedly , it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard . happily , this state of the nation address has given me the possibility to report to parliament and the nation on our 24 apex priorities which , the hon members can find on the government website during the course of next week . the identification of the apex priorities means that all three spheres of government , the national , provincial and local , at both executive and administrative levels , are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people . the entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us , it will do its best to live up to the imperative ― business unusual !we speak of business unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy , efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes , so that the lives of our people should change for the better , sooner rather than later . to make certain that this happens , we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the annual budget the minister of finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the apex priorities . the main categories of these priorities are : improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the second economy , and poverty eradication enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations , with particular focus on some african issues and south-south relations . more than at any other time , the situation that confronts our nation and country , and the tasks we have set ourselves , demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one , to do all the things that have to be done , understanding that in a very real sense , all of us , together , hold our own future in our hands ! as we act together everywhere in our country , this we must also understand that what we have to be about is ― business unusual ! as i was preparing this address , one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow . he suggested that this morning , to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us , i should recall the well-known words with which charles dickens opened his novel , a tale of two cities . and so i quote these words : it was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of light , it was the season of darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to heaven , we were all going direct the other way - in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . you will ask whether i agree with this assessment , whether i too believe that we have entered an era of confusion , in which all of us cannot but lose our way , unsure of our steps , unsteady on our feet , fearful of the future ! my answer to this question is a definite no !like the rest of our government i am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our countrys forward march in the last 14 years remain in place . they continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people . thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation . however , like all the honourable members , i am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow . they are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity . they are concerned about some developments in our economy , especially the steady increase in interest rates , food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor . some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the united states . they are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices . this is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the national commissioner of police , the suspension of the national director of public prosecutions , fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law , and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes . they are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in tshwane last month . while they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs , they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic , nonracial , nonsexist and prosperous south africa . most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom . let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the south africa visualised in our constitution . the national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course . this must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges , but surmountable challenges . and precisely because it is a period of challenges , it is also an era of opportunity ! in this regard , i would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the chief executive of anglo american , cynthia carroll , when she addressed the mining indaba here in cape town earlier this week , on tuesday , february 5 . as the honourable members know , she said : i dont regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster . and south africa is not alone : there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in chile and brazil . sure , the problems here are serious ; but if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation , we will all come through ― i hope relatively unscathed this is not a time for finger pointing , but for working together in finding solutions . this having been said , it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the government and eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding . i would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties . in the past two weeks , the ministers of minerals and energy and public enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation . last week the honourable members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters . in essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream . the resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy . in this situation , we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin . as government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge . among other things , we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient . there are concrete actions each individual , household and business can take . these are being disseminated by the department of minerals and energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you , our compatriots , may give to us and share with one another . die regering sal begin met die implementering van ’n veldtog om doeltreffende beligting te verseker , asook watervehitting deur middel van sonkrag , die beheer van die las van warmwatertoestelle in huishoudings , insluitend behuisingstandaarde vir alle nuwe huise en ontwikkelings . an instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not . on the supply side eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency . we are taking steps to enhance eskoms maintenance capacity . we have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects . all these actions , taken together with the electricity saving measures , will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin . the massive eskom build programme in new generation , transmission and distribution capacity will continue ; in this regard , i would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can . in a meeting with the chairman of general electric during the course of last week , ge offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf . in south africa our own large companies such as sasol , anglo and bhp billiton are all in concrete discussions with the departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint . the approach is one of common action rather than recrimination . i particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of january . we will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry . collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency . task teams are currently working in many areas . next week the provincial premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country . they will be supported by technical teams from edi holdings , eskom and the national energy efficiency agency . the department of provincial and local government will coordinate this activity supported by the line departments of mineral and energy and public enterprises . the minister of finance will provide more information in the budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to eskom in its build programme . we face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period . this situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end . however , given our large base of installed generation capacity , for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity . we are a minerals resource economy . we must therefore continue to support the mining industry . it is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country , we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry . however it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient . indeed , energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity . let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid . let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us , inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for business unusual ! this is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the fifa confederations cup in 2009 and the 2010 fifa soccer world cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today . i mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully . of course , i have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to fifa and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever fifa soccer world cup tournament . the sense that we get , across all sectors of south african society and further afield , represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations , is one of - business unusual : all hands on deck for 2010 !we must ensure that we sustain this approach . we are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong south african team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud . i am certain that the south african football association , our coaches led by carlos alberto parreira , and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and africa should be proud . once more we thank the springboks for showing the way when they won the rugby world cup last year . this must inspire bafana bafana , as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the beijing olympic games later this year . let me now turn to the apex priorities i mentioned . further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the industrial policy action plan . government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation . in this regard , r2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further r5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy . working together with business and labour , we shall also develop as urgently as possible , key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist , such as mining and minerals beneficiation , consumer durables , retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises , construction , the creative industries , agriculture and agro-processing . once more i would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the motor industry development programme is maintained . at the macro-economic level , we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability . to speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan , with specific emphasis on energy efficiency . this entails coordinating the programmes of the state-owned enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans , including freight and other logistics , energy pipelines , information and communications technology , road infrastructure , water and electricity , both in terms of their timing and geographic location . cutting across these plans , and therefore a critical priority , is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right . accordingly , we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of infraco . already , money has been allocated for sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation . working with other governments on the continent and the private sector , we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables . at the same time , we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50 of the population by the end of the year . attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in south africa of set top boxes , which should be finalised by the middle of the year . having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition , infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions , we have decided , in the spirit of business unusual , work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes . an element of governments apex of priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development . work to review the national human resource development strategy will be completed this year , and the projects that the joint team of government , labour , business and academic institutions organised under the joint initiative on priority skills acquisition will be intensified . indeed , we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the ceos of 70 of the jse-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills . in addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training colleges , the sector education and training authorities , resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles , freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees , and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates . further , after correcting weaknesses in our adult basic education programme , which we identified last year , we shall this month launch the kha ri gude mass literacy campaign . this will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008 . madame speaker and chairperson at the centre of our economic programmes is , and should always be , the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all south africans , acting as an important weapon in our war on poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all . in the programme to provide sustainable human settlements , we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum , and an agreement has been reached with the south african local government association to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme . along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction , we continue to address a number many weaknesses , including the processing of the land use management bill , the finalisation of the land restitution cases , the support programme for those who acquire land , and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme . these are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year , and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves . yet another critical apex priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge . these include children , women , the youth , people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements , people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly . among the key proposed interventions are : expanding the public works programme , employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups , enhancing employment search capability , improving education and training , improving services and assets among poor communities , specific interventions in poor households , and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors . among others , we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment . parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14 . but we will all agree that our society , and the poor specifically , cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops ― important as these may be . in any case , most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated . as such , in the spirit of business unusual , government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help , in the intervening period , to alleviate their plight in those individual households . for this , we will require a national war room for a war against poverty bringing together departments such as social development , provincial and local government , trade and industry , agriculture and land affairs , public works and health as well as provincial and local administrations , which will work with nongovernmental organisations and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency . die oudit van grondeienaarskap sal ook bespoedig word . scaling up the national youth service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the military skills development programme of the south african national defence force from the current 4 000 to 10 000 . r700 million has already been given to the sandf to start scaling up this programme ; die uitbreiding van die openbare werke-program , wat , deur die vasgestelde doelwitte te oortref , die potensiaal getoon het om meer nuwelinge te absorber . about r1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the epwp ; and through the small enterprises development agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed . we will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements , with intensified efforts , as a matter of urgent priority , to accelerate universal access to water , sanitation and electricity , so that by 2014 , we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services . accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the national strategic plan against hiv and aids . we also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis defaulter rates from 10 to 7 , train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant tb patients receive treatment . we aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system , benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners . as we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for business unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation . two such issues deserve brief mention . the first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies , as well as a youth pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all south africans . the minister of education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters . the second issue is about geographic and place names , which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose . we will launch this synchronised process soon , guided by the south african geographical names council and its provincial committees . madame speaker and chairperson , when we reflected on the issue of crime at last years joint sitting of parliament , we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime , but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder ― bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy . accordingly , last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population , to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality . in this regard , in the spirit of business unusual , cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new , modernised , efficient and transformed criminal justice system . among other things , this will entail setting up a new coordinating and management structure for the system at every level , from national to local , bringing together the judiciary and magistracy , the police , prosecutors , correctional services and the legal aid board , as well as other interventions , including the empowerment of the community police forums . as the honourable members are aware , some of these initiatives are already under way ; the ministers of the justice , crime prevention and security cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week . informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime , as well as the recommendations of the khampepe judicial commission on the functioning and location of the directorate of special operations and continuing reflections on this matter , including the reform of the criminal justice system , we shall by the end of march this year , interact with parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime . what will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management , efficiency and coordination of our law-enforcement agencies . of great importance , our success in the fight against crime depends on cooperation among all of us as law-abiding citizens , inspired by the principles of rule of law , respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights , which our constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements . if anything , the spirit of business unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants . there are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to , as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state . firstly , it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging . the department of public service and administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision . secondly , by may of every year all senior managers should have filed their key performance agreements with relevant authorities . the office of the public service commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard . thirdly , recognising that the department of home affairs touches the core of every citizens life , we will this year intensify the implementation of the turnaround strategy approved by cabinet . this includes improving the information technology systems , training of staff on the new systems , rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new id card . improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management . further , it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties ― a task that belongs to the leadership , the public servants themselves and the trade union movement . in this regard , this year , in consultation with public sector unions , we will convene a public sector summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of batho pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided . working with other social partners , we shall ensure that , by the end of this year , the second national anticorruption programme is adopted , and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented . at local government level , we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anticorruption strategies . we shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year local government strategic agenda . to ensure systematic monitoring in this regard , salga has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done . in order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans , women and youth , we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements , including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment . many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning . thus , as part of our apex priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance governments capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans , covering all spheres of government . the programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the african peer review mechanism . our focus , in promoting the african agenda this year , will be on the strengthening of the african institutions , including the african union and its development programme , nepad . this we shall do , inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels . a critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration . we continue to be committed to a free trade area in the southern african development community , and hope to use our chairpersonship of sadc in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard . it is in this context , as well , that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the european union , within the context of the process led by the african union , to ensure that the negotiations on the economic partnership agreement are completed as soon as possible , premised on accelerating the development of our region . over the past year , we carried out the mandate of sadc to assist the political leadership of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face . we had an opportunity , on the fringes of the au summit in addis ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of sadc on this matter . in short , the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address . these include issues relating to the constitution , security , media and electoral laws , and other matters that have been in contention for many years . the relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament , including the necessary constitutional amendments . what is outstanding , however , is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed draft constitution . accordingly , we join the sadc heads of state and government in congratulating the parties to the zimbabwe dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter . as requested by the sadc heads of state and government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the zimbabwe negotiations . at the same time , we wish the people of zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of march . our multifaceted relations with the democratic republic of congo will continue , as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace , and implement their reconstruction and development programme . our government will remain seized of the processes under way in kenya , chad , burundi , darfur in the sudan , western sahara , côte divoire , somalia , the comoros and the central african republic to find lasting peace and stability . we call on all african compatriots to do whatever we can , together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments . we will , of course , continue to carry out our tasks in the united nations security council . critical in this regard , is the strengthening of cooperation between the un security council and the peace and security council of the african union . impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples , particularly in the developing countries , we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the india-brazil-south africa forums , the new africa-asia strategic partnership , the non-aligned movement , the group of 77 and negotiations to complete the sacu-mercusor trade agreement . in the same measure , we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the kyoto protocol on climate change and ongoing improvements in this regard , and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the wto doha development round . this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between south africa and the peoples republic of china . the mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the china-south africa partnership for growth and development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit , which can only grow from strength to strength . next year , south africa will play host to the review conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the world conference against racism which was held in our country in 2001 . we are confident that , informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity , the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the review conference achieves its objectives . these global responsibilities , including the hosting of the 2010 fifa soccer world cup , bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity . but we should not take this for granted . i am confident that , under the leadership of the international marketing council , trade and investment south africa , tourism south africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of business unusual , and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate africas humanity in 2010 . what i do know and hereby make bold to say is : whatever the challenges of the moment , we are still on course ! i say this with unshakeable conviction because i am certain that south africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history ― to strain every sinew of our being ― to respond to the national challenges of the day , including those relating to our economy , the political and economic situation in africa and elsewhere in the world , and seize the opportunities that our countrys progress over the last fourteen years has provided . with all hands on deck , and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion , we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels . issued by : the presidency february 2008  state of the nation address of the president of south africa , kgalema motlanthe , to the joint sitting of parliament , cape town february 2009 madam deputy president ; deputy speaker and deputy chairperson of the national council of provinces ; chief justice langa ; the former deputy president of the republic of south africa and president of the anc ; the former chief justice and former presiding officers of parliament ; your excellencies , ambassadors and high commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries ; honourable leaders of political parties and members of parliament , traditional leaders ; your worship the mayor of the city of cape town ; religious leaders and representatives of civil society ; i am privileged to address the joint sitting of the parliament of the republic of south africa , at the beginning of this last session of our third democratic parliament . i stand before the people of south africa with humility at the opportunity i have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former president . mine is a responsibility , within a matter of a few months , to lead the national executive in completing the mandate accorded the african national congress in the 2004 elections , and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running . that we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system , reflected in part in the cooperation of members of the executive ― old and new ― and the steady hand of our public sector managers . as we look back over the past fifteen years , i wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of presidents nelson mandela and thabo mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy : in the executive and the administration , the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the judiciary ; driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all south africans . above all , i stand before you with pride and confidence that the south africa we celebrate today ― worlds apart from the divisions , conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago ― is a product of the labours and toils of south african women and men from all walks of life . these south africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation . within the galaxy of outstanding south africans are members of our democratic parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last february to bid the final farewell . they include brian bunting , billy nair , ncumisa kondlo , john gomomo , joe nhlanhla , cas saloojee , john schippers and jan van eck . to these , i would also like to add ms helen suzman , a truly distinguished south african , who represented the values of our new parliament in the chambers of the old . it is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that ― whatever economic storms may pound our shores , whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition ― our nation is in a good state . however , we should not underestimate the challenges we face . the global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people . naturally , the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers . as a consequence , some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult . but ours is a journey of hope and resilience . our democracy is healthy . it is steadily growing stronger , underpinned by a constitution hardly equalled in the world . indeed , the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest ― which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful ― is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy . it is south africas people who have ensured its progress ; allow me , madame speaker and chairperson , in this context to urge all eligible south africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections , so that we can shape our destiny ourselves . this we should do every working day in the municipal offices , before the voters roll is closed . but we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the electoral commission of south africa tomorrow and sunday , the 7th and 8th of february respectively . i should also take this opportunity to indicate that i will in the next few days conclude consultations with the electoral commission and the provincial premiers and announce the date of the elections . we owe our being as a democracy to the people of south africa who , on 27 april 1994 , for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands . through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country , we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all . it is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the declaration of the oau ad-hoc committee on southern africa on the question of south africa adopted in august , 1989 ― commonly known as the harare declaration . that initiative laid the foundation for global consensus , through the united nations , on the approach to negotiations in south africa . within south africa , it also informed the content of the 1989 conference for a democratic future ― bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life . all this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994 . in this regard , we should salute the late president of the african national congress , oliver reginald tambo , for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country . that courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation , in the place of war and conflict , reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago : that is , the conclusion in 1909 of the national convention which presaged the formation of the union of south africa . while that convention defined the territorial integrity of south africa as we know it today , it was based on racial oppression and exclusion . those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance . in this regard , we salute that brave son of our people , solomon kalushi mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high , in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom . allow me to acknowledge lucas mahlangu , brother of kalushi , representing the mahlangu family . solomon mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear , among whom we count those under king cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the british army in isandlwana , in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands . a hundred and thirty years on , we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts . in the centres of learning , the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership . a group of valiant students broke away from nusas to found the south african students organisation 40 years ago . within this generation are the early leaders of saso , which included : strini moodley , professor barney pityana , steve biko , onkgopotse tiro , harry nengwekhulu , themba sono , mapetla mohapi , mosioua lekota , johnny issel and mthuli ka shezi . for inspiring hope in a period of despair , we salute them . in this regard , we wish to acknowledge onkgopotse tiros cousin , pat tlhagwana . in this context we also wish to acknowledge the late ephraim mogale , the founding president 30 years ago of the congress of south african students , and his peers . in the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message , that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth . the message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago , that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity ; that we should indeed , in the words of the freedom charter , open ever wider the doors of learning and of culture ! we call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak ; we do have today a well-functioning democratic system , based on principles of transparency and openness , with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the constitution to support democracy . over the years , we have steadily improved the structures of governance . we have built a system of healthy intergovernmental relations across the spheres , and improved integration within and among them . indeed , government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service , which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society . however , while women constitute about 34 of all senior positions in the public service , this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves . at the level of the national and provincial legislatures , indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32 women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully , even the 40 achieved in the 2006 local government elections . we hope that all political parties will , as they finalise their electoral lists , make their contribution to this noble endeavour ! though some progress has been made , at 0,2 , the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government , measured against the 2 target we set ourselves . on both counts , the private sector is lagging far behind . various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service , including financial management , thusong service centres and other service delivery innovations , izimbizo and , as currently in the department of home affairs , firm leadership . however , much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants , especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public . as honourable members will be aware , our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus . this is reflected , among others , in legislation , rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike , partnerships with civil society and the business community , as well as anti-corruption hotlines . the same challenges confront the private sector . i am certain that we are all agreed that the wellbeing of our society depends , critically , on the progress we make in expanding the nations wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole . it is common cause that , after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s , south africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940 . in the first decade of freedom , economic growth averaged 3 per year , and this improved to 5 per year on average from 2004 to 2007 . while the consumer boom , impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates , played its part in this regard , we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward . these include , in the first instance , higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors . in this regard , some five years ago , we were hovering around 16 of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of gross domestic product . such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22 , closer to the 25 that we projected to attain only in 2014 . this is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure . it is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments ; the focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade , and the efforts , especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact . it is in this context that the accelerated and shared growth initiative is being implemented , ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks , integrated industrial policy and programmes , the skills challenge , regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner . our economy has become more open , and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system . our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms . yet , the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations . our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports . except for the services sector , we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors , especially manufacturing . as such , the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries . it is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large current account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth . and because we have a low savings rate , we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes . these are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward . of critical importance is the question : what in fact should economic growth be about ?wealth is created in order to improve peoples quality of life . thus , the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations . importantly , sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption , ensuring that there is decent work . in this latter period , for the first time since the attainment of democracy , more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market , thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31 in 2003 to 23 in 2007 . of course , this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs , including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy . sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action , including broad-based black economic empowerment . this is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda . in reality , a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential . the fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations , in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes . sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods . honourable members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage . i will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face . we have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage . to quote work conducted by a team of academics at the university of stellenbosch , led by professor servaas van der berg : firstly , money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century . the reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards . thirdly , the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook poverty has decreased since the transition , but inequality has not improved . on a critical matter of detail , the researchers further observe : the prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years . indeed , these observations are confirmed by our own research , which shows that income poverty especially among african and coloured communities has declined , partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants . while the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999 , by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million . this is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the child support grant , which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008 . as part of the contribution to the income of the poor , the target for 1-million work opportunities through the expanded public works programme was attained in 2008 , a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate . this has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality . with regard to household access to basic services , the figures speak for themselves . evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities . child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85 ; we are also heartened that research into hiv prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection . yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines , appropriate staffing levels , and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity . in some of these facilities , management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement . in education , we have seen a drop in the educator : learner ratio ; at the same time , much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas . of course we do know that the dropout rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high , and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society . in addition , trends in performance , both in terms of teaching and learning , show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past . ironically , precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty , is where infrastructure , administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive . governments social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor , in the form of housing ― with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided . we should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better . overall , we are proud of the advances in our social programmes . but we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change . be it in education , health , housing , water or sanitation , the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services !on this we still have some way to go . the scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for south africans . daily experience , in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike , is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack . within public and private institutions , the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern of course , the overall crime rate , having peaked in 2002 , has consistently declined . all kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this . but we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough , not even at the 7-10 rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime . this points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods , especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime . it points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system , both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management . these are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address . yet , in being brutally self-critical , we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys , by far , better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country . this is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone , in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture , their demographic composition , and their systems of accountability . but let us not delude ourselves : as with the rest of our social life , such transformation is still at its nascent stages . we still have a long way to go . i am certain that honourable members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society . in this regard , we have through legislation , international conventions , regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children , women , people with disability and the elderly . through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups , we have improved awareness around issues that affect them ; it is a matter of proud record that , for instance , female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care ; yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women , youth and people with disability . hiv impacts most severely on young women . violence against women and children is much too high . all these are assignments for the coming period . madame speaker and honourable chairperson ; there is no gainsaying that , by any measure , the progress made since 1994 has been impressive . but neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense . it is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience , continuity and change , by former president nelson mandela , in his biography , long walk to freedom : i have walked that long road to freedom . i have made missteps along the way . but i have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . i have taken a moment here to rest , to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me , to look back on the distance i have come . but i can rest only for a moment , for with freedom comes responsibilities , and i dare not linger , for my long walk is not yet ended . in a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy . while our approaches may differ , the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our constitution : to create a united , nonracial , nonsexist , democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world . six years ago , leaders of our people came together in a growth and development summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of south africans , particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014 . i am certain , that , as part of and in addition to , these objectives south africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system ; i cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society . rather , i have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that south africa does not suffer the poverty of visions . our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation . these ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity , as reflected in the united nations millennium development goals . and yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years , if not decades , as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village . what , on the surface , started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch , with severe consequences for actual production and trade . we can decry the greed , the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis . we can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems . yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region , and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society . what we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis . but we are all too aware that , because we are strongly integrated into the world economy , demand for our exports has declined ; these difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high . combined , these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects . as such , we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation . we know too that south africa is less severely affected than many other countries . indeed , in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions , south africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth , even if at a slower rate . in this regard , honourable members , i am happy to report that in the interactions between the presidency and leaders of various social partners , we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society . firstly , government will continue with its public investment projects , the value of which has increased to r690-billion for the next three years . in this regard , where necessary , we will find creative ways to raise funds . this will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies , as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds . secondly , we will intensify public sector employment programmes . on the one hand , plans to expand employment in sectors such as health , social work , education and law-enforcement agencies will continue . on the other , we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the expanded public works programme . thirdly , mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants . on its part , government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors , and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis . alternatives to layoffs will be explored , including longer holidays , extended training , short time and job-sharing . this will be combined with promotion of the proudly south africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports . fourthly , government will sustain and expand social expenditure , including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men . in addition , we will more widely utilise the social distress relief grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the unemployment insurance fund or who have exhausted their benefits . we shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anticompetitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations . in this regard , we wish to commend the competition commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book . we do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure , among other things , that as input prices decline , the benefit is felt by the population . these immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy . however , we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable . this also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better . our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation . both in the g20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions , our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe . critically , we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system , complete the current negotiations on the doha round of world trade negotiations , and ensure that development aid is not scaled down . in our own country , we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path . the length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat . but we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later . in this regard , how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way , will be of paramount importance . i refer here in particular to the fifa world cup in 2010 as well as the confederations cup a few months from now . virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion ― from stadia , transport infrastructure , security measures , issues of accommodation , to health and immigration plans ― confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament . and we believe that , after five consecutive wins , the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations ! but beyond this , the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase south african and african hospitality and humanity ― to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world . we also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted south africas pursuit of excellence over the past year . special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings . we are of course rugby world champions ; giniel de villiers and his team have won the dakar rally ; our paralympians continue to do us proud ; just two weeks ago , south africa completed with mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of timbuktu . this rich heritage points to africa as a beacon of science and literature , philosophy and commerce , interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for africas wealth . this initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition . indeed , over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the african century . it is this , and this alone , that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country . we wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in zimbabwe for concluding negotiations , delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the subcontinent as a whole : that is , a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face . we are truly heartened that , yesterday , the zimbabwean parliament passed amendment 19 of the constitution , laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government . special mention in this regard is due to sadc facilitator , former president thabo mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion . in this respect , there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country . we are confident that , because it cares , the international community will partner the people of zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail . we are also encouraged that , whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the democratic republic of congo on their march to stability and prosperity , that progress is inexorable . the partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the drc and rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis ; in the same measure , we will continue to work with other countries and the african union to pursue these objectives in burundi , sudan , western sahara , côte divoire , somalia and elsewhere . as would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months , south africa will use the privilege of chairing sadc to strengthen this critical regional institution , with particular emphasis on implementing summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion . we will as always seek to strengthen cooperation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity . we are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china . over these years , it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership . we also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with brazil and india through ibsa ; and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with russia , and countries in asia , the middle east , as well as latin and north america . we have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the middle east in general and in israel and palestine in particular . the depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life , of especially civilians ― including children , women and the elderly ― indeed defies description . there can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery . and we do hope that this time round , the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit , so israelis and palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories . our special congratulations to the government and people of cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and , with it , the freedom to choose their path of development . we were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the european union on our strategic partnership ; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the economic partnership agreements with countries in our region . we look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the south africa-eu summit later this year . along with other countries of the south we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the united nations , the international monetary fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic , equitable and transparent manner . we also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements , including the kyoto protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world . informing these our endeavours are two basic principles : the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004 ; in the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections , we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate . as part of the many detailed projects contained in the governments programme of action , we will pay particular attention to : continuing with the war on poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the comprehensive anti-poverty strategy through the public consultations now under way ; continuing research and consultations on the comprehensive social security system , including the matter of national health insurance ; integrating into the work of the relevant clusters the findings of research on second economy interventions such as the community works programme , support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives ; and facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures , youth development , the rights of people with disability and childrens rights ― including completing consultations on the national youth policy , preparing for the implementation of the african youth charter once it has been processed by parliament , and for the setting up of the national youth development agency ; and extending the number of municipalities that have set up childrens rights focal points beyond the current 60 . these and other programmes , including the apex priorities identified in the state of the nation address last february , form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future . we will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm , the hope and the resilience of the south african people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us . this , and this in the main , is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state . it is steadily growing stronger . and so , in the words of former president mandela , dare not linger , for long walk is not yet ended . i thank you . issued by : the presidency february 2009
